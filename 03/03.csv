for evaluating hearing aids in complex acoustic conditions. To further
establish the feasibility of this approach, this study investigated the
interaction between spatial resolution of different reproduction methods and
technical and perceptual hearing aid performance measures using computer
simulations. Three spatial audio reproduction methods -- discrete speakers,
vector base amplitude panning and higher order ambisonics -- were compared in
regular circular loudspeaker arrays with 4 to 72 channels. The influence of
reproduction method and array size on performance measures of representative
multi-microphone hearing aid algorithm classes with spatially distributed
microphones and a representative single channel noise-reduction algorithm was
analyzed. Algorithm classes differed in their way of analyzing and exploiting
spatial properties of the sound field, requiring different accuracy of sound
field reproduction. Performance measures included beam pattern analysis,
signal-to-noise ratio analysis, perceptual localization prediction, and quality
modeling. The results show performance differences and interaction effects
between reproduction method and algorithm class that may be used for guidance
when selecting the appropriate method and number of speakers for specific tasks
in hearing aid research.

emission peaks in their HI lines observed in emission. This so-called $V/R$
phenomenon is usually explained by the precession of a one-armed spiral density
perturbation in the circumstellar disk. That global-disk oscillation scenario
was confirmed, both observationally and theoretically, in the previous series
of two papers analyzing the Be shell star {\zeta} Tauri. The vertically
averaged (2D) global-disk oscillation model used at the time was able to
reproduce the $V/R$ variations observed in H{\alpha}, as well as the spatially
resolved interferometric data from AMBER/VLTI. Unfortunately, that model failed
to reproduce the $V/R$ phase of Br15 and the amplitude of the polarization
variation, suggesting that the inner disk structure predicted by the model was
incorrect.
  Aims. The first aim of the present paper is to quantify the temporal
variations of the shell-line characteristics of {\zeta} Tauri. The second aim
is to better understand the physics underlying the $V/R$ phenomenon by modeling
the shell-line variations together with the $V/R$ and polarimetric variations.
The third aim is to test a new 2.5D disk oscillation model, which solves the
set of equations that describe the 3D perturbed disk structure but keeps only
the equatorial (i.e., 2D) component of the solution. This approximation was
adopted to allow comparisons with the previous 2D model, and as a first step
toward a future 3D model.
  Results. The new 2.5D formalism improves the agreement with the observed
$V/R$ variations of H{\alpha} and Br15, under the proviso that a large value of
the viscosity parameter, {\alpha} = 0.8, be adopted. Nonetheless, it remains
challenging for the models to reproduce consistently the amplitude and the
average level of the polarization data, whatever formalism is adopted.

it to a related but not identical dataset. One successfully used framework of
domain adaptation is to learn a transformation to match both the distribution
of the features (marginal distribution), and the distribution of the labels
given features (conditional distribution). In this paper, we propose a new
domain adaptation framework named Deep Transfer Network (DTN), where the highly
flexible deep neural networks are used to implement such a distribution
matching process.
  This is achieved by two types of layers in DTN: the shared feature extraction
layers which learn a shared feature subspace in which the marginal
distributions of the source and the target samples are drawn close, and the
discrimination layers which match conditional distributions by classifier
transduction. We also show that DTN has a computation complexity linear to the
number of training samples, making it suitable to large-scale problems. By
combining the best paradigms in both worlds (deep neural networks in
recognition, and matching marginal and conditional distributions in domain
adaptation), we demonstrate by extensive experiments that DTN improves
significantly over former methods in both execution time and classification
accuracy.

enabled new measurements of winds over previously sampled latitudes as well as
measurements at high northern latitudes that have recently come into better
view. These new observations also used techniques to greatly improve signal to
noise ratios, making possible the detection and tracking of more subtle cloud
features. The 250 m/s prograde jet peaking near 60 N was confirmed and more
accurately characterized. Several long-lived cloud features have also been
tracked. The winds pole-ward of 60 N are consistent with solid body rotation at
a westward (prograde) rate of 4.3 deg/h with respect to Uranus' interior. When
combined with 2007 and other recent measurements, it is clear that a small but
well-resolved asymmetry exists in the zonal profile at middle latitudes,
peaking at 35 deg, where southern winds are 20 m/s more westward than
corresponding northern winds. High S/N Keck II imaging of the north polar
region of Uranus reveals a transition from streaky bands below 60 N to a region
from 60 deg to nearly the north pole, where widely distributed small bright
spots, resembling cumulus cloud fields, with several isolated dark spots, are
the dominant style of cloud features. This presents a stark contrast to 2003
detailed views of the south polar region of Uranus when no discrete cloud
features could be detected in comparable Keck II near-IR images. The pressure
levels of discrete clouds estimated from spatial modulations in H and Hcont
images indicate that the polar cloud features are generally in the 1.3 to 2-3
bar range, as are equatorial and several mid-latitude features. Several of the
brighter mid latitude features are found above the 1.2-bar level of methane
condensation.

renormalization in nanowires in contact with a bulk superconductor in the
strong tunnel-coupled regime, showing explicitly that this renormalization
depends strongly on the transverse size of the one-dimensional nanowires. For
metallic (e.g. Fe on Pb) or semiconducting (e.g. InSb on Nb) nanowires, the
renormalization effect is found to be very strong and weak respectively because
the transverse confinement size in the two situations happens to be 0.5nm
(metallic nanowire) and 20nm (semiconducting nanowire). Thus, the Majorana
localization length could be very short (long) for metallic (semiconducting)
nanowires even for the same values of all other parameters (except for the
transverse wire size). We also show that any tunneling conductance measurements
in such nanowires, carried out at temperatures and/or energy resolutions
comparable to the induced superconducting energy gap, cannot distinguish
between the existence of the Majorana modes or ordinary subgap fermionic states
since both produce very similar broad and weak peaks in the subgap tunneling
conductance independent of the localization length involved. Only low
temperature (and high resolution) tunneling measurements manifesting sharp zero
bias peaks can be considered to be signatures of Majorana modes in topological
nanowires.

subspaces. We find equivalent conditions to describe proper subspaces. Then we
prove a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that a proper subspace is
compatible. Each proper subspace $\mathcal{S}$ has a supplement $\mathcal{T}$

A search was performed for correlations between neutrino arrival times and
directions as well as neutrino emission following time dependent lightcurves,
sporadic emission or periodicities of candidate sources. These include active
galactic nuclei, soft $\gamma$-ray repeaters, supernova remnants hosting
pulsars, micro-quasars and X-ray binaries. The work presented here updates and

systems are the enabling technology. In particular for CW applications, much
effort is being expended to minimize the power dissipation (surface resistance)
of niobium cavities. Starting in 2009, we suggested a means of reducing the
residual resistance by performing a thermal cycle [1], a procedure of warming
up a cavity after initial cooldown to about 20K and cooling it down again. In
subsequent studies [2], this technique was used to manipulate the residual
resistance by more than a factor of 2. It was postulated that thermocurrents
during cooldown generate additional trapped magnetic flux that impacts the
cavity quality factor. Here, we present a more extensive study that includes
measurements of two additional passband modes and that confirms the effect. In
this paper, we also discuss simulations that support the claim. While the
layout of the cavity LHe tank system is cylindrically symmetric, we show that
the temperature dependence of the material parameters results in a
non-symmetric current distribution. Hence a significant amount of magnetic flux
can be generated at the RF surface.

ultrafine magnetic particle systems. In this work, we examine time-dependent
magnetization in high-quality, monodisperse hollow maghemite nanoparticles with
a 14.8 $\pm$ 0.5 nm outer diameter and enhanced surface-to-volume ratio. The
nanoparticle ensemble exhibits spin-glass-like signatures in dc magnetic aging
and memory protocols and ac magnetic susceptibility. The dynamics of the system
slows near 50 K, and becomes frozen on experimental time scales below 20 K.
Remanence curves indicate the development of magnetic irreversibility
concurrent with the freezing of the spin dynamics. A strong exchange-bias
effect and its training behavior point to highly frustrated surface spins that
rearrange much more slowly than interior spins with bulk coordination. Monte
Carlo simulations of a hollow particle reproducing the experimental morphology
corroborated strongly disordered surface layers with complex energy landscapes
that underlie both glass-like dynamics and magnetic irreversibility. Calculated
hysteresis loops reveal that magnetic behavior is not identical at the inner
and outer surfaces, with spins at the outer surface layer of the 15 nm hollow
particles exhibiting a higher degree of frustration. Our study sheds light on
the origin of spin-glass-like phenomena and the role of surface spins in
magnetic hollow nanostructures.

desired time-varying motion-force profiles in the presence of a stiff
environment. In many cases, the interaction with the environment affects only
one degree of freedom of the end-effector of the manipulator. Therefore, the
focus is on this contact degree of freedom, and a switching position-force
controller is proposed to perform the hybrid position-force tracking task.
Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee input-to-state stability of
the switching closed-loop system with respect to perturbations related to the
time-varying desired motion-force profile. The switching occurs when the
manipulator makes or breaks contact with the environment. The analysis shows
that to guarantee closed-loop stability while tracking arbitrary time-varying
motion-force profiles, the controller should implement a considerable (and
often unrealistic) amount of damping, resulting in inferior tracking
performance. Therefore, we propose to redesign the manipulator with a compliant
wrist. Guidelines are provided for the design of the compliant wrist while
employing the designed switching control strategy, such that stable tracking of
a motion-force reference trajectory can be achieved and bouncing of the
manipulator while making contact with the stiff environment can be avoided.
Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of
the approach.

traditional record linkage. First, although different members in the same group
can share some similar global values of an attribute, they represent different

be huge (with tens of thousands of records), requiring high scalability even

  We present a two-stage algorithm: the first stage identifies cores containing

possible erroneous values; the second stage collects strong evidence from the

stochastic block model, for the special case of two non-overlapping symmetric
communities. This gives raise in particular to new algorithmic challenges
driven by the thresholds. This paper investigates whether a general phenomenon
takes place for multiple communities, without imposing symmetry.
  In the general stochastic block model $\text{SBM}(n,p,Q)$, $n$ vertices are
split into $k$ communities of relative size $\{p_i\}_{i \in [k]}$, and vertices
in community $i$ and $j$ connect independently with probability
$\{Q_{i,j}\}_{i,j \in [k]}$. This paper investigates the partial and exact
recovery of communities in the general SBM (in the constant and logarithmic
degree regimes), and uses the generality of the results to tackle overlapping
communities.
  The contributions of the paper are: (i) an explicit characterization of the
recovery threshold in the general SBM in terms of a new divergence function
$D_+$, which generalizes the Hellinger and Chernoff divergences, and which
provides an operational meaning to a divergence function analog to the
KL-divergence in the channel coding theorem, (ii) the development of an
algorithm that recovers the communities all the way down to the optimal
threshold and runs in quasi-linear time, showing that exact recovery has no
information-theoretic to computational gap for multiple communities, in
contrast to the conjectures made for detection with more than 4 communities;
note that the algorithm is optimal both in terms of achieving the threshold and
in having quasi-linear complexity, (iii) the development of an efficient
algorithm that detects communities in the constant degree regime with an
explicit accuracy bound that can be made arbitrarily close to 1 when a
prescribed signal-to-noise ratio (defined in term of the spectrum of
$\diag(p)Q$) tends to infinity.

financial systems. The modular structure of the framework allows to accommodate
for a variety of shock scenarios, methods to estimate interbank exposures and
mechanisms of distress propagation. The main features are as follows. First,
the framework allows to estimate and disentangle not only first-round effects
(i.e. shock on external assets) and second-round effects (i.e. distress induced
in the interbank network), but also third-round effects induced by possible
fire sales. Second, it allows to monitor at the same time the impact of shocks
on individual or groups of financial institutions as well as their
vulnerability to shocks on counterparties or certain asset classes. Third, it
includes estimates for loss distributions, thus combining network effects with
familiar risk measures such as VaR and CVaR. Fourth, in order to perform
robustness analyses and cope with incomplete data, the framework features a
module for the generation of sets of networks of interbank exposures that are
coherent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank. As an illustration,
we carry out a stress-test exercise on a dataset of listed European banks over
the years 2008-2013. We find that second-round and third-round effects dominate

distributed stream-connected components provided as closed-source services. The
Kahn Process Network (KPN) is taken as a formal model of computation and a
Message Definition Language (MDL) is introduced to describe the format of
messages communicated between the processes. MDL links input and output
interfaces of a node to support flow inheritance and contextualisation. Since
interfaces can also be linked by the existence of a data channel between them,
the match is generally not only partial but also substantially nonlocal. The
KPN communication graph thus becomes a graph of interlocked constraints to be
satisfied by specific instances of the variables. We present an algorithm that
solves the CSP by iterative approximation while generating an adjunct Boolean
SAT problem on the way. We developed a solver in OCaml as well as tools that
analyse the source code of KPN vertices to derive MDL terms and automatically
modify the code by propagating type definitions back to the vertices after the
CSP has been solved. Techniques and approaches are illustrated on a KPN
implementing an image processing algorithm as a running example.

support a pair of massive Bosonic excitations of the time-reversed pairs
labeled by their parity under charge conjugation. These modes are degenerate
for 2D $^3$He-A. Crystal field anisotropy lifts the degeneracy. Strong
anisotropy also leads to low-lying Fermions, and thus to channels for the decay
of the Bosonic modes. Selection rules and phase space considerations lead to
large asymmetries in the lifetimes and hybridization of the Bosonic modes with
the continuum of un-bound Fermion pairs. We also highlight results for the
excitation of the Bosonic modes by microwave radiation that provide clear
signatures of the Bosonic modes of an anisotropic chiral ground state.

have become common today. To efficiently analyze such large graphs, many
distributed graph computing systems have been developed. These systems employ
the ""think like a vertex"" programming paradigm, where a program proceeds in
iterations and at each iteration, vertices exchange messages with each other.
However, using Pregel's simple message passing mechanism, some vertices may
send/receive significantly more messages than others due to either the high
degree of these vertices or the logic of the algorithm used. This forms the
communication bottleneck and leads to imbalanced workload among machines in the
cluster. In this paper, we propose two effective message reduction techniques:
(1)vertex mirroring with message combining, and (2)an additional
request-respond API. These techniques not only reduce the total number of
messages exchanged through the network, but also bound the number of messages
sent/received by any single vertex. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness
of our techniques, and implement them on top of our open-source Pregel
implementation called Pregel+. Our experiments on various large real graphs
demonstrate that our message reduction techniques significantly improve the
performance of distributed graph computation.

done by analyzing a recently introduced class of totally asymmetric exclusion

interactions are weaker and more short-range than the correlations for the

affect dynamic properties of molecular motors. The implications of these

width extracted from the exponential fit within the visible range is strongly
correlated with the aliphatic/aromatic ratio in isolated kerogen, regardless of
the kerogen type. No correlation is found between the decay width and the
average size of aromatic clusters, which is explained in terms of a non-linear
increase in optical absorption with increasing size of the aromatic clusters
determined by 13C NMR. Further, absorption spectra calculated with density
functional theory calculations on proxy ensemble models of kerogen are in
excellent agreement with the experimental results. The correlation of the decay
width with conventional maturity indicators such as vitrinite reflectance is
found to be good within a particular kerogen type, but not consistent across
different kerogen types, reflecting systematic variations in bulk composition
for different type kerogen types with the same vitrinite reflectance. Thus,
diffuse reflectance visible absorption spectroscopy is presented as a rapid,
calibrated and non-destructive method to monitor both the maturity and the
chemical composition of kerogen. The chemical insight of kerogen in relation to

screening of kerogen for electronics and optical devices in place of

non-rotating supermassive BH. The accretion flow is radiation pressure
dominated and takes the form of a geometrically thick disk with twin
low-density funnels around the rotation axis. For accretion rates $\gtrsim 10
\dot M_{\rm Edd}$, there is sufficient gas in the funnel to make this region
optically thick. Radiation from the disk first flows into the funnel, after
which it accelerates the optically thick funnel gas along the axis. The
resulting jet is baryon-loaded and has a terminal density-weighted velocity
$\approx 0.3c$. Much of the radiative luminosity is converted into kinetic
energy by the time the escaping gas becomes optically thin. For an observer
viewing down the axis, the isotropic equivalent luminosity of total energy is
as much as $10^{48}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for a $10^7 M_\odot$ BH accreting at
$10^3$ Eddington. Therefore, energetically, the simulated jets are consistent
with observations of the most powerful tidal disruption events, e.g., Swift
J1644. The jet velocity is, however, too low to match the Lorentz factor
$\gamma > 2$ inferred in J1644. There is no such conflict in the case of other
tidal disruption events. Since favorably oriented observers see isotropic
equivalent luminosities that are highly super-Eddington, the simulated models
can explain observations of ultra-luminous X-ray sources, at least in terms of
luminosity and energetics, without requiring intermediate mass black holes.
Finally, since the simulated jets are baryon-loaded and have mildly
relativistic velocities, they match well the jets observed in SS433. The latter
are, however, more collimated than the simulated jets. This suggests that, even
if magnetic fields are not important for acceleration, they may perhaps still
play a role in confining the jet.

double hashing and fully random hashing is the same in the balanced allocation
paradigm using fluid limit methods. Here we extend a coupling argument used by
Lueker and Molodowitch to show that double hashing and ideal uniform hashing

as such does not undermine that independence (unless there are particular
initial conditions of the universe that would amount to conspiracy). Only
entanglement could do so. However, generic entanglement without collapse on the

maps in a decorated skein exact triangle that extends the oriented skein exact
triangle in knot Floer homology. In particular, we completely determine the
Alexander and Maslov grading shifts.
  As a corollary, we compute the maps induced by elementary cobordisms between
unlinks. We show that these give rise to a $(1+1)$-dimensional TQFT that
coincides with the reduced Khovanov TQFT. Hence, when applied to the cube of
resolutions of a marked link diagram, it gives the complex defining the reduced
Khovanov homology of the knot. Finally, we define a spectral sequence from
(reduced) Khovanov homology using these cobordism maps, and we prove that it is
an invariant of the (marked) link.

dimensionality of streaming input data. Such networks learn the principal
subspace, in the sense of principal component analysis (PCA), by adjusting
synaptic weights according to activity-dependent learning rules. When derived
from a principled cost function these rules are nonlocal and hence biologically
implausible. At the same time, biologically plausible local rules have been
postulated rather than derived from a principled cost function. Here, to bridge
this gap, we derive a biologically plausible network for subspace learning on
streaming data by minimizing a principled cost function. In a departure from
previous work, where cost was quantified by the representation, or
reconstruction, error, we adopt a multidimensional scaling (MDS) cost function
for streaming data. The resulting algorithm relies only on biologically
plausible Hebbian and anti-Hebbian local learning rules. In a stochastic
setting, synaptic weights converge to a stationary state which projects the
input data onto the principal subspace. If the data are generated by a
nonstationary distribution, the network can track the principal subspace. Thus,
our result makes a step towards an algorithmic theory of neural computation.

effects and the underlying event background. To calculate the nuclear

considering degenerate Hessian metrics defined on radiant manifolds. A manifold
$M$ is said to be radiant if it is endowed with a symmetric, flat connection
$\bar\nabla$ and a global vector field $\rho$ whose covariant derivative is the

tensor $g$ that can locally be written as the covariant Hessian of a function,
called potential. A function on $M$ is said to be extensive if its Lie
derivative with respect to $\rho$ is the function itself. We show that the
Hessian metrics appearing in equilibrium thermodynamics are necessarily
degenerate, owing to the fact that their potentials are extensive (up to an
additive constant). Manifolds having degenerate Hessian metrics always contain
embedded Hessian submanifolds, which generalize the manifolds defined by
constant volume in which Ruppeiner geometry is usually studied. By means of
examples, we illustrate that linking scalar curvature to microscopic
interactions within a thermodynamic system is inaccurate under this approach.

minimizing the regularized representation error they derived an online
algorithm, which learns Gabor-filter receptive fields from a natural image
ensemble in agreement with physiological experiments. Whereas the OF algorithm
can be mapped onto the dynamics and synaptic plasticity in a single-layer
neural network, the derived learning rule is nonlocal - the synaptic weight
update depends on the activity of neurons other than just pre- and postsynaptic
ones - and hence biologically implausible. Here, to overcome this problem, we
derive sparse dictionary learning from a novel cost-function - a regularized
error of the symmetric factorization of the input's similarity matrix. Our
algorithm maps onto a neural network of the same architecture as OF but using
only biologically plausible local learning rules. When trained on natural
images our network learns Gabor-filter receptive fields and reproduces the
correlation among synaptic weights hard-wired in the OF network. Therefore,
online symmetric matrix factorization may serve as an algorithmic theory of
neural computation.

described by a perturbation theory based on an integrable Hamiltonian
renormalized so as to incorporate the integrable part of the map. The
renormalized perturbation theory is successfully applied to the two quantum
maps, the H\'enon and standard maps. In spite of different nature of tunneling
in the two systems, the I-NI transition exhibits very common characteristics.
In particular, the manifestation of I-NI transition is obviously explained by a
remarkable quenching of the renormalized transition matrix element. The
enhancement of tunneling probability after the transition can be understood as
a sudden change of the tunneling mechanism from the instanton to quite a
different mechanism supported by classical flows just outside of the

the inflation can be described by a conformal Hamiltonian system characterized
by an exponential phase space expansion without introducing any inflaton field
as well as an {\it ad hoc} inflation potential. This implies that the emergent
spacetime may incapacitate all the rationales to introduce the multiverse
hypothesis. In Part I we will focus on the physical foundation of cosmic
inflation from the emergent spacetime picture to highlight the main idea. Its
mathematical exposition will be addressed in Part II with a generalization of
the emergent spacetime picture to matrix string theory.

waveform for a merging black-hole binary at ten different extraction radii (in
the range r/M=75-190) and for three different resolutions in the convergence

the expected values with increasing resolution, which is not the case for the
`raw' waveform at finite radius. We also examine the phase and amplitude errors

the edge of the Local Group and beyond, but no comprehensive search for stellar
counterparts to these systems has been presented. Careful visual inspection of
all publicly available optical and ultraviolet imaging at the position of the
UCHVCs revealed six blue, diffuse counterparts with a morphology consistent
with a faint dwarf galaxy beyond the Local Group. Optical spectroscopy of all
six candidate dwarf counterparts show that five have an H$\alpha$-derived
velocity consistent with the coincident HI cloud, confirming their association,
the sixth diffuse counterpart is likely a background object. The size and
luminosity of the UCHVC dwarfs is consistent with other known Local Volume
dwarf irregular galaxies. The gas fraction ($M_{HI}/M_{star}$) of the five
dwarfs are generally consistent with that of dwarf irregular galaxies in the
Local Volume, although ALFALFA-Dw1 (associated with ALFALFA UCHVC
HVC274.68+74.70$-$123) has a very high $M_{HI}/M_{star}$$\sim$40. Despite the
heterogenous nature of our search, we demonstrate that the current dwarf
companions to UCHVCs are at the edge of detectability due to their low surface
brightness, and that deeper searches are likely to find more stellar systems.
If more sensitive searches do not reveal further stellar counterparts to
UCHVCs, then the dearth of such systems around the Local Group may be in
conflict with $\Lambda$CDM simulations.

Survey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations of
galaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 < z < 3.5$. We use the
Internal Color Dispersion (ICD), measured between the rest-frame UV and optical
bands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellar
populations. The ICD shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologies
of the galaxies. Galaxies with the largest variation in their stellar
populations as evidenced by high ICD have disk-dominated morphologies (with
S\'{e}rsic indexes $< 2$) and stellar masses between $10 < \mathrm{Log~M/
M_\odot}< 11$. There is a marked decrease in the ICD as the stellar mass and/or
the S\'ersic index increases. By studying the relations between the ICD and
other galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, and
dust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellar
populations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-forming
clumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. This phase reaches a peak for
galaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 < \mathrm{Log~M/ M_\odot}
< 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. In contrast,
galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher S\'{e}rsic index ($n
> 2$) show reduced ICD values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellar
populations. This indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulge
along with a star forming disk, typical of Hubble Sequence galaxies, this is
most common for stellar masses $10 < \mathrm{Log~M/M_\odot} < 11$ and when the
bulge component remains relatively small ($n<2$).

of mergers and accretion as drivers of morphological transformations. We use a
state-of-the-art hydrodynamical code which includes star formation, feedback
and chemical enrichment to carry out our study. We run two simulations, where
we include or neglect the effects of radiation pressure from stars, to
investigate the impact of this process on the morphologies and star formation
rates of the simulated galaxies. We find that the simulated M31 and MW have
different formation histories, even though both inhabit, at z=0, the same
environment. These differences directly translate into and explain variations
in their star formation rates, in-situ fractions and final morphologies. The
M31 candidate has an active merger history, as a result of which its stellar
disc is unable to survive unaffected until the present time. In contrast, the
MW candidate has a smoother history with no major mergers at late times, and
forms a disc that grows steadily; at z=0 the simulated MW has an extended,
rotationally-supported disc which is dominant over the bulge. Our two feedback
implementations predict similar evolution of the galaxies and their discs,
although some variations are detected, the most important of which is the
formation time of the discs: in the model with weaker/stronger feedback the
discs form earlier/later. In summary, by comparing the formation histories of
the two galaxies, we conclude that the particular merger/accretion history of a
galaxy rather than its environment at the LG-scales is the main driver of the
formation and subsequent growth or destruction of galaxy discs.

\emph{macroscopic Laplacian} $\Delta_\omega$, as the divergence of the
horizontal gradient, once a volume $\omega$ is fixed, and the \emph{microscopic
Laplacian}, as the operator associated with a sequence of geodesic random
walks. We consider a general class of random walks, where \emph{all}
sub-Riemannian geodesics are taken in account. This operator depends only on
the choice of a complement $\mathbf{c}$ to the sub-Riemannian distribution, and
is denoted $L^c$.
  We address the problem of equivalence of the two operators. This problem is
interesting since, on equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds, there is always an
intrinsic volume (e.g. Popp's one $P$) but not a canonical choice of
complement. The result depends heavily on the type of structure under
investigation. On contact structures, for every volume $\omega$, there exists a
unique complement $c$ such that $\Delta_\omega=L^c$. On Carnot groups, if $H$
is the Haar volume, then there always exists a complement $c$ such that
$\Delta_H=L^c$. However this complement is not unique in general. For
quasi-contact structures, in general, $\Delta_P \neq L^c$ for any choice of
$c$. In particular, $L^c$ is not symmetric w.r.t. Popp's measure. This is
surprising especially in dimension 4 where, in a suitable sense, $\Delta_P$ is
the unique intrinsic macroscopic Laplacian.
  A crucial notion that we introduce here is the N-intrinsic volume, i.e. a
volume that depends only on the set of parameters of the nilpotent
approximation. When the nilpotent approximation does not depend on the point, a
N-intrinsic volume is unique up to a scaling by a constant and the
corresponding N-intrinsic sub-Laplacian is unique. This is what happens for
dimension smaller or equal than 4, and in particular in the 4-dimensional
quasi-contact structure mentioned above.

""primordial"" composition (i.e., N abundances similar to those in field stars)
are the most centrally concentrated within the WFC3 field. We then combine our
WFC3 data with SDSS u, g photometry and find that the trend reverses for radii
>1' (3 pc) where the ratio of primordial to N-enhanced giants increases
outwards, as already found by Lardo et al. The ratio of primordial to enriched
stars thus has a U-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near the
half-light radius. N-body simulations show that mass segregation might produce
a trend resembling the observed one, but only if the N-enhanced giants are
~0.25 Mo less massive than the primordial giants, which requires extreme He
enhancement (Y~0.40). However, such a large difference in Y is incompatible
with the negligible optical color differences between primordial and enriched
giants which suggest Delta Y < 0.03 and thus a difference in turn-off mass of
Delta M < 0.04 Mo between the different populations. The radial trends in M15
are thus unlikely to be of dynamical origin and presumably reflect initial
conditions, a result that challenges all current GC formation scenarios. We
note that population gradients in the central regions of GCs remain poorly
investigated and may show a more diverse behavior than hitherto thought.

theory underlying these jets. In particular, we derive the analogues of the

hole's velocity, $M$ is its mass, and $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux. We show that
energy extraction from boosted black holes is conceptually similar to energy
extraction from spinning black holes. However, we highlight two key technical
differences: in the boosted case, jet power is no longer defined with respect
to a Killing vector, and the relevant notion of black hole mass is observer

membrane lives at infinity rather than the horizon and we show that this is

density matrix for a subsystem corresponding to an excited eigenstate is
""thermal."" Here we expound on this hypothesis by asking: for which class of
operators, local or non-local, is ETH satisfied? We show that this question is
directly related to a seemingly unrelated question: is the Hamiltonian of a
system encoded within a single eigenstate? We formulate a strong form of ETH
where in the thermodynamic limit, the reduced density matrix of a subsystem
corresponding to a pure, finite energy density eigenstate asymptotically
becomes equal to the thermal reduced density matrix, as long as the subsystem
size is much less than the total system size, irrespective of how large the
subsystem is compared to any intrinsic length scale of the system. This allows
one to access the properties of the underlying Hamiltonian at arbitrary energy
densities/temperatures using just a $\textit{single}$ eigenstate. We provide
support for our conjecture by performing an exact diagonalization study of a
non-integrable 1D lattice quantum model with only energy conservation. In
addition, we examine the case in which the subsystem size is a finite fraction
of the total system size, and find that even in this case, a large class of
operators continue to match their canonical expectation values. Specifically,
the von Neumann entanglement entropy equals the thermal entropy as long as the
subsystem is less than half the total system. We also study, both analytically
and numerically, a particle number conserving model at infinite temperature
which substantiates our conjectures.

measurements provide new constraints on the connections between dark matter
halo properties and galaxy properties in the context of the evolving
large-scale structure of the universe. Using both an analytic model and a set
of mock galaxy catalogs, we find a strong correlation between central galaxy
stellar mass and dark matter halo mass over the range
$M_\mathrm{halo}\sim10^{11}$-$10^{13}~h^{-1}M_\odot$, approximately consistent
with previous observations and theoretical predictions. However, the
stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) and the mass scale where star formation
efficiency reaches a maximum appear to evolve more strongly than predicted by
other models, including models based primarily on abundance-matching
constraints. We find that the fraction of satellite galaxies in haloes of a
given mass decreases significantly from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.9$, partly due to
the fact that haloes at fixed mass are rarer at higher redshift and have lower
abundances. We also find that the $M_1/M_\mathrm{min}$ ratio, a model parameter
that quantifies the critical mass above which haloes host at least one
satellite, decreases from $\approx20$ at $z\sim0$ to $\approx13$ at $z\sim0.9$.
Considering the evolution of the subhalo mass function vis-\`{a}-vis satellite
abundances, this trend has implications for relations between satellite
galaxies and halo substructures and for intracluster mass, which we argue has
grown due to stripped and disrupted satellites between $z\sim0.9$ and
$z\sim0.5$.

catalysis. The dimensional reduction of the low-energy dynamics of relativistic
fermions in an external magnetic field is explained and its role in catalyzing
spontaneous symmetry breaking is emphasized. The general theoretical
consideration is supplemented by the analysis of the magnetic catalysis in
quantum electrodynamics, chromodynamics and quasirelativistic models relevant
for condensed matter physics. By generalizing the ideas of the magnetic
catalysis to the case of nonzero density and temperature, we argue that other
interesting phenomena take place. The chiral magnetic and chiral separation
effects are perhaps the most interesting among them. In addition to the general
discussion of the physics underlying chiral magnetic and separation effects, we
also review their possible phenomenological implications in heavy-ion
collisions and compact stars. We also discuss the application of the magnetic
catalysis ideas for the description of the quantum Hall effect in monolayer and
bilayer graphene, and conclude that the generalized magnetic catalysis,
including both the magnetic catalysis condensates and the quantum Hall
ferromagnetic ones, lies at the basis of this phenomenon. We also consider how
an external magnetic field affects the underlying physics in a class of
three-dimensional quasirelativistic condensed matter systems, Dirac semimetals.
While at sufficiently low temperatures and zero density of charge carriers,
such semimetals are expected to reveal the regime of the magnetic catalysis,

allows self-consistent models of reionization that exploit the accurate
representation of the diffuse gas distribution together with the realistic
growth of galaxies provided by these simulations, within a representative
cosmological volume. In this work, we apply and compare two radiative transfer
algorithms implemented in a GPU-accelerated code to the $106.5\,{\rm Mpc}$ wide
volume of Illustris in postprocessing in order to investigate the reionization
transition predicted by this model. We find that the first generation of
galaxies formed by Illustris is just about able to reionize the universe by
redshift $z\sim 7$, provided quite optimistic assumptions about the escape
fraction and the resolution limitations are made. Our most optimistic model
finds an optical depth of $\tau\simeq 0.065$, which is in very good agreement
with recent Planck 2015 determinations. Furthermore, we show that moment-based
approaches for radiative transfer with the M1 closure give broadly consistent
results with our angular-resolved radiative transfer scheme. In our favoured
fiducial model, 20\% of the hydrogen is reionized by redshift $z=9.20$, and
this rapidly climbs to 80\% by redshift $z=6.92$. It then takes until $z=6.24$
before 99\% of the hydrogen is ionized. On average, reionization proceeds
`inside-out' in our models, with a size distribution of reionized bubbles that
progressively features regions of ever larger size while the abundance of small

reconstruction techniques for numerical schemes for hyperbolic conservation and
balance laws. In their definition, there appears a small positive parameter,
usually called $\epsilon$, that was originally introduced in order to avoid a
division by zero on constant states, but whose value was later shown to affect
the convergence properties of the schemes. Recently, two detailed studies of
the role of this parameter, in the case of uniform meshes, were published. In
this paper we extend their results to the case of finite volume schemes on
non-uniform meshes, which is very important for h-adaptive schemes, showing the
benefits of choosing $\epsilon$ as a function of the local mesh size $h_j$. In
particular we show that choosing $\epsilon=h_j^2$ or $\epsilon=h_j$ is
beneficial for the error and convergence order, studying on several non-uniform
grids the effect of this choice on the reconstruction error, on fully discrete
schemes for the linear transport equation, on the stability of the numerical
schemes. Finally we compare the different choices for $\epsilon$ in the case of
a well-balanced scheme for the Saint-Venant system for shallow water flows and
in the case of an h-adaptive scheme for nonlinear systems of conservation laws

finite conductivity ({\sigma}). In our approach we calculate the corresponding
high energy emission by integrating the trajectories of test particles that

applications and services have access to accurate and real-time location
information, raising serious privacy concerns for their users. The recently
introduced notion of geo-indistinguishability tries to address this problem by
adapting the well-known concept of differential privacy to the area of
location-based systems. Although geo-indistinguishability presents various
appealing aspects, it has the problem of treating space in a uniform way,
imposing the addition of the same amount of noise everywhere on the map. In
this paper we propose a novel elastic distinguishability metric that warps the
geometrical distance, capturing the different degrees of density of each area.
As a consequence, the obtained mechanism adapts the level of noise while
achieving the same degree of privacy everywhere. We also show how such an
elastic metric can easily incorporate the concept of a ""geographic fence"" that
is commonly employed to protect the highly recurrent locations of a user, such
as his home or work. We perform an extensive evaluation of our technique by
building an elastic metric for Paris' wide metropolitan area, using semantic
information from the OpenStreetMap database. We compare the resulting mechanism
against the Planar Laplace mechanism satisfying standard
geo-indistinguishability, using two real-world datasets from the Gowalla and
Brightkite location-based social networks. The results show that the elastic
mechanism adapts well to the semantics of each area, adjusting the noise as we
move outside the city center, hence offering better overall privacy.

multiply imaged quasars are expected to be discovered and monitored regularly.
Light curves from the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are further
affected by superimposed variability due to microlensing. In order to
disentangle the microlensing from the intrinsic variability of the light
curves, the time delays between the multiple images have to be accurately
measured. The resulting microlensing light curves can then be analyzed to
reveal information about the background source, such as the size of the quasar
accretion disc. In this paper we present the most extensive and coherent
collection of simulated microlensing light curves; we have generated $>2.5$
billion light curves using the GERLUMPH high resolution microlensing
magnification maps. Our simulations can be used to: train algorithms to measure
lensed quasar time delays, plan future monitoring campaigns, and study light
curve properties throughout parameter space. Our data are openly available to
the community and are complemented by online eResearch tools, located at

demonstrate experimentally that photoconductivity in a model organic

coherent superposition of vibrational motions in a pentacene/C60 photoresistor,
we observe that excitation of certain modes in the 1500-1700 cm$^{-1}$ region

standard formulation is as a non-convex optimization problem which is solved in
practice by heuristics based on alternating minimization. Re- cent work has
resulted in several algorithms for sparse coding with provable guarantees, but
somewhat surprisingly these are outperformed by the simple alternating
minimization heuristics. Here we give a general framework for understanding
alternating minimization which we leverage to analyze existing heuristics and
to design new ones also with provable guarantees. Some of these algorithms seem
implementable on simple neural architectures, which was the original motivation
of Olshausen and Field (1997a) in introducing sparse coding. We also give the
first efficient algorithm for sparse coding that works almost up to the
information theoretic limit for sparse recovery on incoherent dictionaries. All
previous algorithms that approached or surpassed this limit run in time
exponential in some natural parameter. Finally, our algorithms improve upon the
sample complexity of existing approaches. We believe that our analysis

with pronounced increases in plane metric and cell volume, accompanied by a
rough doubling of Tc to a 100K level of an orthorhombic with 3-fold O
coordinated chain Cu (O3 type). These states decay over a non-superconducting
transition range to the conventional Tc=50K level of O24. We consider the plane
expanded laser pulsed materials to contain aspects of O42 plane n-doped
counterparts of the O3 n-doped version of shot quench preparations. In
addition, we assume that highly charged p-doped chains of 4-fold O coordination
form hole pairs at trijugate position, allowing close approach of the apical O
to the electron-doped planes. They are now capable of participating in the
bonding with the plane pairs at corresponding 3a0/2 location. The overall pair
number is therefore multiplied, and the coupling strengthened, by limited 3-D
effects within the Plane-Chain-Plane sandwich. The latter can be seen as an
extended chemical bonding system that has the potential to equilibrate
contractive and expansive pairs and so obviate the need for distinction of
doping type as it may exchange it dynamically. It is argued that indications
for a Tc=200K level on shot quenching has a related origin and represents one
in series of predicted Tc levels based on bond order principles. Predictions

already extensively been applied to various model potentials, here we test its
applicability to protein solutions with their complex interactions. We
successfully map their experimentally determined metastable gas--liquid
binodals, as available in the literature, to the binodals of short-range
square-well fluids, as determined by previous as well as new Monte Carlo
simulations. This is achieved by representing the binodals as a function of the
temperature scaled with the critical temperature (or as a function of the
reduced second virial coefficient) and the concentration scaled by the cube of
an effective particle diameter, where the scalings take into account the
attractive and repulsive contributions to the interaction potential,
respectively. The scaled binodals of the protein solutions coincide with
simulation data of the adhesive hard-sphere fluid. Furthermore, once the
repulsive contributions are taken into account by the effective particle
diameter, the temperature dependence of the reduced second virial coefficients
follows a master curve that corresponds to a linear temperature dependence of
the depth of the square-well potential. We moreover demonstrate that, based on
this approach and cloud-point measurements only, second virial coefficients can
be estimated, which we show to agree with values determined by light scattering

has a marginally better mean per-user SINR performance due to its superior

the bulge region or to major mergers that happened a long time ago. We show
that independently of merger events, tidal features like shells or rings can
also arise if the the dark matter is an ultra light scalar field of mass
~10$^{-22}$eV/c$^2$. In the scalar field dark matter (SFDM) model the small
mass precludes halo formation below ~10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$ reducing the number of
small galaxies today, it produces shallow density profiles due to the
uncertainty principle in contrast to the steep profiles found in the standard
cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, in addition to the usual soliton solution
there exists dark matter haloes in multistates, characterized by ripples in
their density profiles, which are stable provided that most of the halo mass
resides in the ground state. We use the hydrodynamics code ZEUS to track the
gas evolution in a background potential given by a superposition of the ground
and first excited state of the scalar field, we study this configuration when
it is initially unstable (excited state more massive than ground state) but by
a population inversion in the states it eventually becomes stable, this could
happen when haloes decoupled from the expansion of the universe and collapse to
reach a state of equilibrium. We found that tidal structures like rings are
formed at a particular radii as a direct consequence of the wavelike structure

systems, hence, it is urgent to develop advanced channel estimation methods to
remove the impulsive interference and to exploit channel sparsity
simultaneously. In this paper, robust impulsive-mitigation adaptive sparse
channel estimation (IMAC) method is proposed for solving aforementioned
technical issues. Specifically, first of all, the non-Gaussian noise model is

undirected, positively weighted graph, one vertex is a target. The algorithm's
task is to identify the target by adaptively querying vertices. In response to
querying a node $q$, the algorithm learns either that $q$ is the target, or is
given an edge out of $q$ that lies on a shortest path from $q$ to the target.
We study this problem in a general noisy model in which each query
independently receives a correct answer with probability $p > \frac{1}{2}$ (a
known constant), and an (adversarial) incorrect one with probability $1-p$.
  Our main positive result is that when $p = 1$ (i.e., all answers are
correct), $\log_2 n$ queries are always sufficient. For general $p$, we give an
(almost information-theoretically optimal) algorithm that uses, in expectation,
no more than $(1 - \delta)\frac{\log_2 n}{1 - H(p)} + o(\log n) + O(\log^2
(1/\delta))$ queries, and identifies the target correctly with probability at
leas $1-\delta$. Here, $H(p) = -(p \log p + (1-p) \log(1-p))$ denotes the
entropy. The first bound is achieved by the algorithm that iteratively queries
a 1-median of the nodes not ruled out yet; the second bound by careful repeated
invocations of a multiplicative weights algorithm.
  Even for $p = 1$, we show several hardness results for the problem of
determining whether a target can be found using $K$ queries. Our upper bound of
$\log_2 n$ implies a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for undirected connected
graphs; we show that this is best-possible under the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH). Furthermore, for directed graphs, or for undirected graphs
with non-uniform node querying costs, the problem is PSPACE-complete. For a
semi-adaptive version, in which one may query $r$ nodes each in $k$ rounds, we
show membership in $\Sigma_{2k-1}$ in the polynomial hierarchy, and hardness
for $\Sigma_{2k-5}$.

equation is simultaneously solved by $m$ agents assuming each agent knows only
a subset of the rows of the partitioned matrix $(A,b)$, the current estimates
of the equation's solution generated by its neighbors, and nothing more. Each
agent recursively updates its estimate by utilizing the current estimates
generated by each of its neighbors. Neighbor relations are characterized by a
time-dependent directed graph $\mathbb{N}(t)$ whose vertices correspond to
agents and whose arcs depict neighbor relations. It is shown that for any
matrix $A$ for which the equation has a solution and any sequence of
""repeatedly jointly strongly connected graphs"" $\mathbb{N}(t)$, $t=1,2,\ldots$,
the algorithm causes all agents' estimates to converge exponentially fast to
the same solution to $Ax=b$. It is also shown that the neighbor graph sequence
must actually be repeatedly jointly strongly connected if exponential
convergence is to be assured. A worst case convergence rate bound is derived
for the case when $Ax=b$ has a unique solution. It is demonstrated that with
minor modification, the algorithm can track the solution to $Ax = b$, even if
$A$ and $b$ are changing with time, provided the rates of change of $A$ and $b$
are sufficiently small. It is also shown that in the absence of communication
delays, exponential convergence to a solution occurs even if the times at which
each agent updates its estimates are not synchronized with the update times of
its neighbors. A modification of the algorithm is outlined which enables it to
obtain a least squares solution to $Ax=b$ in a distributed manner, even if

microfluidic system to investigate conditions leading to size-separation of
suspended particles. This model system can be easily reconfigured to establish
an arbitrary orientation between the average flow field and the array of
obstacles comprising the stationary phase (forcing angle). We also investigate
the effect of obstacle size using two arrays with different obstacles but same
surface-to-surface distance between them. In all cases, we observe the presence
of a locked mode at small forcing angles, in which particles move along a
principal direction in the lattice until a locked-to-zigzag transition takes
place when the driving force reaches a critical angle. We show that the
transition occurs at increasing angles for larger particles, thus enabling
particle separation at specific forcing angles. Moreover, we observe a linear
correlation between the critical angle and the size of the particles that could
be used in the design of microfluidic systems with a fixed orientation of the
flow field. Finally, we present a simple model, based on the presence of
irreversible interactions between the suspended particles and the obstacles,
which describes the observed dependence of the migration angle on the
orientation of the average flow.

formation based on graph rigidity in which each pair of ""neighboring"" agents is
responsible for maintaining a prescribed target distance between them. In a
recent paper a systematic method was proposed for devising gradient control
laws for asymptotically stabilizing a large class of rigid, undirected
formations in two dimensional space assuming all agents are described by
kinematic point models. The aim of this paper is to explain what happens to
such formations if neighboring agents have slightly different understandings of
what the desired distance between them is supposed to be or equivalently if
neighboring agents have differing estimates of what the actual distance between
them is. In either case, what one would expect would be a gradual distortion of
the formation from its target shape as discrepancies in desired or sensed
distances increase. While this is observed for the gradient laws in question,
something else quite unexpected happens at the same time. It is shown that for
any rigidity-based, undirected formation of this type which is comprised of
three or more agents, that if some neighboring agents have slightly different
understandings of what the desired distances between them are suppose to be,
then almost for certain, the trajectory of the resulting distorted but rigid
formation will converge exponentially fast to a closed circular orbit in
two-dimensional space which is traversed periodically at a constant angular
speed.

slow and time consuming. It is also important to monitor the spread of Dengue.
Fiji needs an convenient method of monitoring the spread of Dengue. With

integration and series switching between the different forms. By separating the

is a problem reduction. In this endeavour we rediscover and reform the

synchronization process starts with low-degree rather than high-degree ones;
(b) the high-degree nodes don't undertake the role of hub; (c) the synchronized

the clustering synchronization behavior emerges even community structure is
absent in the scale-free network. This abnormal synchronizing path suggests
that the diverse synchronization behaviors occur in the same topology, which
implies that the relationship between dynamics and structure of network is much
more complicated than the common sense that the structure is the foundation of

transition of synchronization behavior to disorder in real complex networks,

space. We present a numerical study on the effects of inhomogeneous absorption
on transmission eigenchannels of light in highly scattering media. In the weak
absorption regime, the spatial profile of a transmission channel remains very
similar to that without absorption, and the effect of inhomogeneous absorption
can be stronger or weaker than homogeneous absorption depending on the spatial
overlap of the localized absorbing region with the field intensity maximum of
the channel. In the strong absorption regime, the high transmission channels
redirect the energy flows to circumvent the absorbing regions to minimize loss.
The attenuation of high transmission channels by inhomogeneous absorption is
lower than that by homogeneous absorption, regardless of the location of the
absorbing region. The statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues in
the former becomes broader than that in the latter, due to a longer tail at
high transmission. Since the maximum transmission channel is the most efficient
in bypassing the absorbing region, the ratio of its transmittance to the
average transmittance increases with absorption, eventually exceeds the ratio
without absorption.

constructs are described using rules in the natural semantics style with the
additional observation that these rules may involve the treatment of state. Our
approach involves modeling natural semantics style rules within a logic and
then reasoning about the behavior of particular programs by reasoning about
proofs in that logic. A key aspect of our proposal is to use a fragment of
linear logic called Lolli (invented by Hodas and Miller) to model natural
semantics style descriptions. Being based on linear logic, Lolli can provide
logical expression to resources such as state. Lolli additionally possesses
proof-theoretic properties that allow it to encode natural semantics style
descriptions in such a way that proofs in Lolli mimic the structure of
derivations based on the natural semantics rules. We will discuss these
properties of Lolli and demonstrate how they can be exploited in modeling the
semantics of imperative programs and in reasoning about such models.

obtained from the spectral relaxation is close to an integral solution, is it
possible to find this integral solution even though they might be in completely

It can recover a $k$-partition such that the subspace corresponding to the span
of its indicator vectors is $O(\sqrt{opt})$ close to the original subspace in
spectral norm with $opt$ being the minimum possible ($opt \le 1$ always).
Moreover our algorithm does not impose any restriction on the cluster sizes.
Previously, no algorithm was known which could find a $k$-partition closer than
$o(k \cdot opt)$.
  We present two applications for our algorithm. First one finds a disjoint
union of bounded degree expanders which approximate a given graph in spectral
norm. The second one is for approximating the sparsest $k$-partition in a graph

for faces of the family-variable polytope. We characterize the linear space of
SE objectives and establish a one-to-one correspondence between SE faces of the

standardized supermodular functions. The characterization of SE facets in terms
of extremality of the corresponding supermodular function gives an elegant
method to verify whether an inequality is SE-facet-defining for the

can eliminate linear constraints of the family-variable polytope that
correspond to non-SE facets. However, we show that solely considering SE facets
is not enough as a counter-example shows; one has to consider the linear
inequality constraints that correspond to facets of the characteristic-imset

whether there exists a sequence of dominating sets of $G$ between $D_s$ and

$k$ and can be obtained from the previous one by either adding or deleting
exactly one vertex. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete in general. In
this paper, we study the complexity of this decision problem from the viewpoint
of graph classes. We first prove that the problem remains PSPACE-complete even
for planar graphs, bounded bandwidth graphs, split graphs, and bipartite
graphs. We then give a general scheme to construct linear-time algorithms and
show that the problem can be solved in linear time for cographs, trees, and
interval graphs. Furthermore, for these tractable cases, we can obtain a
desired sequence such that the number of additions and deletions is bounded by
$O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph.

2011dh has a relatively clear shell morphology, being almost circular in

determine the angular radius of SN 2011dh's radio emission to be $636 \pm 29$

using low-order dynamical systems, prototypes of atmospheric circulation, and a
realistic soil model. The deterministic approach proves to be very competitive
with only minor additional computational cost. Most importantly, it offers a
new way to address the problem of accounting for model error in data
assimilation that can easily be implemented in systems of increasing complexity

computation is performed on the input via application of a rule in the

We prove that cellular automaton reservoir holds a distributed representation
of attribute statistics, which provides a more effective computation than local
representation. It is possible to estimate the kernel for linear cellular
automata via metric learning, that enables a much more efficient distance

tearing mode in RFX-mod operated as a circular ohmically heated tokamak. The
feedback suppression of the non-resonant m=2, n=1 Resistive Wall Mode (RWM) in
q(a)<2 plasmas is a well-established result of RFX-mod. The control of the
tearing counterpart, which develops in q(a)>2 equilibrium, is instead a more
difficult issue. In fact, the disruption induced by a growing amplitude m=2,
n=1 tearing mode can be prevented by feedback only when the resonant surface
q=2 is close to the plasma edge, namely 2<q(a)<2.5, and the electron density
does not exceed approximately half of the Greenwald limit. A combined technique
of tearing mode and q(a) control has been therefore developed to recover the
discharge from the most critical conditions: the potentially disruptive tearing
mode is converted into the relatively benign RWM by suddenly decreasing q(a)
below 2. The experiments demonstrate the concept with 100% of successful cases.
The q(a) control has been performed through the plasma current, given the
capability of the toroidal loop-voltage power supply of RFX-mod. We also
propose a path for controlling q(a) by acting on the plasma shape, which could
be applied to medium size elongated tokamaks.

into matrix elements of local four-quark operators up to terms suppressed by
$\Lambda_{QCD}/m_{\psi}$, where $m_{\psi}$ denotes the $J/\psi$ mass. Our

In this
paper, we analyze a short-lived type II burst that started at 07:40 UT on 2011
February 28. By carefully checking white-light images, we find that the type II
radio burst is not accompanied by a coronal mass ejection, only with a C2.4
class flare and narrow jet. However, in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images
provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), we find a wave-like structure that propagated at a speed of
$\sim$ 600 km s$^{-1}$ during the burst. The relationship between the type II
radio burst and the wave-like structure is in particular explored. For this
purpose, we first derive the density distribution under the wave by the
differential emission measure (DEM) method, which is used to restrict the
empirical density model. We then use the restricted density model to invert the
speed of the shock that produces the observed frequency drift rate in the
dynamic spectrum. The inverted shock speed is similar to the speed of the
wave-like structure. This implies that the wave-like structure is most likely a
coronal shock that produces the type II radio burst. We also examine the
evolution of the magnetic field in the flare-associated active region and find
continuous flux emergence and cancellation taking place near the flare site.
Based on these facts, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of the type
II radio burst, i.e., the expansion of the strongly-inclined magnetic loops
after reconnected with nearby emerging flux acts as a piston to generate the
shock wave.

For the epitaxial films, the Altshuler and Aronov electron-electron interaction
(EEI) effect governs the temperature behaviors of the sheet conductance
$\sigma_\square$ at low temperatures, and the ratios of relative change of Hall
coefficient $\Delta R_H/R_H$ to relative change of sheet resistance $\Delta

Altshuler and Aronov EEI theory and seldom observed in other systems. For those
polycrystalline films, both the sheet conductance and Hall coefficient vary
linearly with logarithm of temperature below several tens Kelvin, which can be
well described by the current EEI theories in granular metals. We extract the
intergranular tunneling conductance of each film by comparing the
$\sigma_\square(T)$ data with the predication of EEI theories in granular
metals. It is found that when the tunneling conductance is less than the
conductance of a single indium tin oxide (ITO) grain, the ITO film reveals
granular metal characteristics in transport properties, conversely, the film
shows transport properties of homogeneous disordered conductors. Our results
indicate that electrical transport measurement can not only reveal the

MC model of the entire reactor system, based on the MCNP5 code, that was
already validated in fresh fuel and zero-power configuration (in which thermal
effects are negligible) using the available experimental data as benchmark. In
order to describe the full-power reactor configuration, the temperature
distribution in the core is necessary. To evaluate it, a thermal-hydraulic
model has been developed, using the power distribution results from MC
simulation as input. The thermal-hydraulic model is focused on the core active
region and takes into account sub-cooled boiling effects present at full
reactor power. The obtained temperature distribution is then introduced in the
MC model and a benchmark analysis is carried out to validate the model in fresh
fuel and full-power configuration. The good agreement between experimental data
and simulation results concerning full-power reactor criticality, proves the
reliability of the adopted methodology of analysis, both from neutronics and

accuracy solely using focused light. The technique has therefore become a
powerful tool in the field of biophysics. Optical tweezers thereby provide
outstanding manipulation possibilities of cells as well as semi-transparent
materials, both non-invasively and non-destructively, in biological systems. In
addition, optical tweezers can measure minute forces (< 10-12 N), probe
molecular interactions and their energy landscapes, and apply both static and
dynamic forces in biological systems in a controlled manner. The assessment of
intermolecular forces with force measuring optical tweezers, and thereby the
biomechanical structure of biological objects, has therefore considerably
facilitated our understanding of interactions and structures of biological
systems. Adhesive bacterial organelles, so called pili, mediate adhesion to
host cells and are therefore crucial for the initial bacterial-cell contact.
Thus, they serve as an important virulence factor. The investigation of pili,
both their biogenesis and their expected in vivo properties, brings information
that can be of importance for the design of new drugs to prevent bacterial
infections, which is crucial in the era of increased bacterial resistance
towards antibiotics. In this thesis, an experimental setup of a force measuring
optical tweezers system and the results of a number of biomechanical
investigations of adhesive bacterial organelles are presented. Force measuring
optical tweezers have been used to characterize three different types of
adhesive organelles under various conditions, P, type 1, and S pili, which all

descending chains. In order to compute reasonably precise post-fixpoints of the
resulting systems of equations, Cousot and Cousot have suggested accelerated
fixpoint iteration by means of widening and narrowing.
  The strict separation into phases, however, may unnecessarily give up
precision that cannot be recovered later, as over-approximated interim results
have to be fully propagated through the equation the system. Additionally,
classical two-phased approach is not suitable for equation systems with
infinitely many unknowns---where demand driven solving must be used.
Construction of an intertwined approach must be able to answer when it is safe
to apply narrowing---or when widening must be applied. In general, this is a
difficult problem. In case the right-hand sides of equations are monotonic,
however, we can always apply narrowing whenever we have reached a post-fixpoint
for an equation. The assumption of monotonicity, though, is not met in presence
of widening. It is also not met by equation systems corresponding to
context-sensitive inter-procedural analysis, possibly combining
context-sensitive analysis of local information with flow-insensitive analysis
of globals.
  As a remedy, we present a novel operator that combines a given widening
operator with a given narrowing operator. We present adapted versions of
round-robin as well as of worklist iteration, local and side-effecting solving
algorithms for the combined operator and prove that the resulting solvers
always return sound results and are guaranteed to terminate for monotonic
systems whenever only finitely many unknowns (constraint variables) are
encountered. Practical remedies are proposed for termination in the
non-monotonic case.

Linear Logic, MLLP, which is the multiplicative fragment of Olivier Laurent's
Polarized Linear Logic. This is done by uniformly adding multipoints to various
categorical models of GoI. Multipoints are shown to play an essential role in
semantically characterizing the dynamics of proof networks in polarized proof
theory. For example, they permit us to characterize the key feature of
polarization, focusing, as well as being fundamental to our construction of
concrete polarized GoI models.
  Our approach to polarized GoI involves two independent studies, based on
different categorical perspectives of GoI.
  (i) Inspired by the work of Abramsky, Haghverdi, and Scott, a polarized GoI
situation is defined in which multipoints are added to a traced monoidal
category equipped with a reflexive object $U$. Using this framework,
categorical versions of Girard's Execution formula are defined, as well as the
GoI interpretation of MLLP, proofs. Running the Execution formula is shown to
characterize the focusing property (and thus polarities) as well as the
dynamics of cut-elimination.
  (ii) The Int construction of Joyal-Street-Verity is another fundamental
categorical structure for modelling GoI. Here, we investigate it in a
multipointed setting. Our presentation yields a compact version of
Hamano-Scott's polarized categories, and thus denotational models of MLLP.
These arise from a contravariant duality between monoidal categories of
positive and negative objects, along with an appropriate bimodule structure
(representing ""non-focused proofs"") between them.
  Finally, as a special case of (ii) above, a compact model of MLLP is also
presented based on Rel (the category of sets and relations) equipped with
multi-points.

nontrivial interaction. Two different approaches in the framework of AQFT are
discussed. On the one hand, an inverse scattering problem is considered. A
given factorizing S-matrix is thereby taken as the starting point of the
construction. The particle spectrum taken into account involves an arbitrary
number of massive particle species, transforming under a global gauge group.
Starting from known wedge-local auxiliary fields, the transition to local
theories is shown. To his end, we make use of the modular nuclearity condition
and investigate certain maps from the wedge algebras, generated by the
auxiliary fields, to the considered Hilbert space. Under a very plausible
conjecture it is shown that these maps are nuclear, which implies the
nontriviality of algebras associated with bounded regions in the sense that the
Reeh-Schlieder property holds. A large class of integrable models with
factorizing S-matrices in 1+1 dimensions can be constructed in this way. Among
them are the O(N)-invariant nonlinear sigma-models. Deformation techniques, on
the other hand, constitute a method of construction which may be applied in
arbitrary spacetime dimensions. This approach starts from a known quantum field
theoretic model which is subjected to a certain modification. Here, concretely,
the model of a scalar massive Fermion was deformed. The emerging models are
based on wedge-local fields, allowing for the computation of the two-particle
S-matrix. The resulting scattering matrix depends on the deformation and
differs from the one of the initial model. By restricting to 1+1 dimensions,
the deformation method yields a large class of integrable models with
factorizing S-matrices, including the Sinh-Gordon model.

$2\times10^7 \rmn{yr}$ under a range of orbital migration torques and
circularization rates assumed to arise through interaction with a
protoplanetary disc. Near the inner disc boundary, significant variations of
viscosity, interaction with density waves or with the stellar magnetic field
could occur and halt migration, but allow ircularization to continue. This was
modelled by modifying the migration and circularization rates. Runs terminated
without an extended period of circularization in the absence of migration
torques gave rise to either a collision, or a system close to a resonance.
These were mostly first order with a few $\%$ terminating in second order
resonances. Both planetary eccentricities were small $< 0.1$ and all resonant
angles liberated. This type of survey produced only a limited range of period
ratios and cannot reproduce Kepler observations. When circularization alone
operates in the final stages, divergent migration occurs causing period ratios
to increase. Depending on its strength the whole period ratio range between $1$
and $2$ can be obtained. A few systems close to second order commensurabilities
also occur. In contrast to when arising through convergent migration, resonant
trapping does not occur and resonant angles circulate. Thus the behaviour of
the resonant angles may indicate the form of migration that led to near
resonance.

complexities of financial markets have been inadequate. In this study, we
propose an artificial double auction market as an agent-based model approach to
study the origin of complex states in the financial markets, characterizing
important parameters with an investment strategy that can cover the dynamics of
the financial market. The investment strategy of chartist traders after market
information arrives should reduce market stability originating in the price
fluctuations of risky assets. However, fundamentalist traders strategically
submit orders with a fundamental value and, thereby stabilize the market. We
construct a continuous double auction market and find that the market is

sequence} if $a_0 =0$ and for all $i \geq 2$, $a_i$ is at most 1 plus the
number of ascents in $(a_1, \ldots, a_{i-1})$. Ascent sequences were introduced
by Bousquet-M\'elou, Claesson, Dukes, and Kitaev, who showed that these
sequences of length $n$ are in 1-to-1 correspondence with \tpt-free posets of
size $n$, which, in turn, are in 1-to-1 correspondence with interval orders of
size $n$. Ascent sequences are also in bijection with several other classes of
combinatorial objects including the set of upper triangular matrices with
nonnegative integer entries such that no row or column contains all zeros,
permutations that avoid a certain mesh pattern, and the set of Stoimenow
matchings.
  In this paper, we introduce a generalization of ascent sequences, which we
call {\em $p$-ascent sequences}, where $p \geq 1$. A sequence $(a_1, \ldots,
a_n)$ of nonnegative integers is a $p$-ascent sequence if $a_0 =0$ and for all
$i \geq 2$, $a_i$ is at most $p$ plus the number of ascents in $(a_1, \ldots,
a_{i-1})$. Thus, in our terminology, ascent sequences are 1-ascent sequences.
We generalize a result of the authors by enumerating $p$-ascent sequences with
respect to the number of $0$s. We also generalize a result of Dukes, Kitaev,
Remmel, and Steingr\'{\i}msson by finding the generating function for the
number of $p$-ascent sequences which have no consecutive repeated elements.
Finally, we initiate the study of pattern-avoiding $p$-ascent sequences.

connective tissues, where it forms the extracellular matrix that supports
cells. It has long been known that collagenous tissues exhibit a highly
nonlinear stress-strain relationship (Fung YC, Am J Physiol 213(6),1967;
Humphrey JD, Proc R Soc Lond A: Math Phys Eng Sci 459(2029),2003), although the
origins of this nonlinearity remain unknown (McMahon TA, Lec Math Life Sci

collagen networks is controlled by the applied stress, and that the network
stiffness becomes surprisingly insensitive to network concentration. We
demonstrate how a simple model for networks of elastic fibers can
quantitatively account for the mechanics of reconstituted collagen networks.
Our model points to the important role of normal stresses in determining the
nonlinear shear elastic response, which can explain the approximate exponential
relationship between stress and strain reported for collagenous tissues (Fung
YC, Am J Physiol 213(6),1967). This further suggests new principles for the
design of synthetic fiber networks with collagen-like properties, as well as a
mechanism for the control of the mechanics of such networks.

represent e.g. financial actors, whereas weighted links represent e.g.
financial obligations (credits/debts). Each node has a risk to fail because of
losses resulting from defaulting neighbors, which may lead to large failure
cascades. Classical risk diversification strategies usually neglect network
effects and therefore suggest that risk can be reduced if possible losses
(i.e., exposures) are split among many neighbors (exposure diversification,
ED). But from a complex networks perspective diversification implies higher
connectivity of the system as a whole which can also lead to increasing failure
risk of a node. To cope with this, we propose a different strategy (damage
diversification, DD), i.e. the diversification of losses that are imposed on
neighboring nodes as opposed to losses incurred by the node itself. Here, we
quantify the potential of DD to reduce systemic risk in comparison to ED. For
this, we develop a branching process approximation that we generalize to
weighted networks with (almost) arbitrary degree and weight distributions. This
allows us to identify systemically relevant nodes in a network even if their
directed weights differ strongly. On the macro level, we provide an analytical
expression for the average cascade size, to quantify systemic risk.
Furthermore, on the meso level we calculate failure probabilities of nodes
conditional on their system relevance.

of spiral arms on the gas and stellar dynamics in the Milky Way disc. One of
the fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its angular velocity, or
pattern speed $\Omega_p$, which determines the location of resonances in the
disc and the spirals' radial extent. The most direct method for estimating the
pattern speed relies on backward integration techniques, trying to locate the
stellar birthplace of open clusters. Here we propose a new method based on the
interaction between the spiral arms and the stars in the disc. Using a sample
of around 500 open clusters from the {\it New Catalogue of Optically Visible
Open Clusters and Candidates}, and a sample of 500 giant stars observed by
APOGEE, we find $\Omega_p = 23.0\pm0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, for a local
standard of rest rotation $V_0=220$~km s$^{-1}$ and solar radius $R_0=8.0$~kpc.
Exploring a range in $V_0$ and $R_0$ within the acceptable values, 200-240 km
s$^{-1}$ and 7.5-8.5 kpc, respectively, results only in a small change in our
estimate of $\Omega_p$, that is within the error. Our result is in close
agreement with a number of studies which suggest values in the range 20-25 km
s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. An advantage of our method is that we do not need
knowledge of the stellar age, unlike in the case of the birthplace method,
which allows us to use data from large Galactic surveys. The precision of our
method will be improved once larger samples of disk stars with spectroscopic
information will become available thanks to future surveys such as 4MOST.

399, is found to be unexpectedly X-ray bright for its bolometric luminosity -
in this study we aim to determine its physical nature and the cause of this
behaviour. We find VFTS 399 to be an aperiodic photometric variable with an
apparent near-IR excess. Its optical spectrum demonstrates complex emission
profiles in the lower Balmer series and select HeI lines - taken together these
suggest an OeBe classification. The highly variable X-ray luminosity is too
great to be produced by a single star, while the hard, non-thermal nature
suggests the presence of an accreting relativistic companion. Finally, the
detection of periodic modulation of the X-ray lightcurve is most naturally
explained under the assumption that the accretor is a neutron star. VFTS 399
appears to be the first high-mass X-ray binary identified within 30 Dor.
Comparison of the current properties of VFTS 399 to binary-evolution models
suggests a progenitor mass in excess of 25Msun for the putative neutron star,
which may host a magnetic field comparable in strength to those of magnetars.
VFTS 399 is now the second member of the cohort of rapidly rotating `single'
O-type stars in 30 Dor to show evidence of binary interaction resulting in
spin-up, suggesting that this may be a viable evolutionary pathway for the

the dependence in $\dot{N}(t)$ of the gauge function, is assumed; this action
yields new results. The central finding is that the integrals of motion are
either linear or quadratic in velocities and are generated, respectively by the
conformal Killing vector fields and the conformal Killing tensors of the
configuration space metric deduced from the kinetic part of the Lagrangian
(with appropriate conformal factors). The freedom of re--parametrization allows
one to appropriately scale $N(t)$, so that the potential becomes constant; in
this case the integrals of motion can be constructed from the Killing fields
and Killing tensors of the scaled metric. A rather interesting result is the
non--necessity of the gauge function in Noether's theorem due to the presence
of the Hamiltonian constraint

introduced fairness notion. Given a set of $n$ agents and a set of goods, the
maximin share of a single agent is the best that she can guarantee to herself,
if she would be allowed to partition the goods in any way she prefers, into $n$
bundles, and then receive her least desirable bundle. The objective then in our
problem is to find a partition, so that each agent is guaranteed her maximin
share. In settings with indivisible goods, such allocations are not guaranteed
to exist, so we resort to approximation algorithms. Our main result is a
$2/3$-approximation, that runs in polynomial time for any number of agents.
This improves upon the algorithm of Procaccia and Wang, which also produces a
$2/3$-approximation but runs in polynomial time only for a constant number of
agents. To achieve this, we redesign certain parts of their algorithm.
Furthermore, motivated by the apparent difficulty, both theoretically and
experimentally, in finding lower bounds on the existence of approximate
solutions, we undertake a probabilistic analysis. We prove that in randomly
generated instances, with high probability there exists a maximin share
allocation. This can be seen as a justification of the experimental evidence
reported in relevant works. Finally, we provide further positive results for
two special cases that arise from previous works. The first one is the
intriguing case of $3$ agents, for which it is already known that exact maximin
share allocations do not always exist (contrary to the case of $2$ agents). We
provide a $7/8$-approximation algorithm, improving the previously known result
of $3/4$. The second case is when all item values belong to $\{0, 1, 2\}$,
extending the $\{0, 1\}$ setting studied in Bouveret and Lema\^itre. We obtain
an exact algorithm for any number of agents in this case.

discrete relationships. Thus periodicities, interrelated as members of a

physical perturbation of a lipid interface and the physiochemical nature of the
subsequent acoustic propagation. Pulses are stimulated by local acidification
of a lipid monolayer and propagate, in analogy to sound, at velocities
controlled by the two-dimensional compressibility of the interface. With
transient local pH changes of 0.6 units directly observed at the interface and
velocities up to 1.4 m/s this represents hitherto the fastest protonic
communication observed. Furthermore simultaneously propagating mechanical and
electrical changes in the lipid interface up to 8 mN/m and 100 mV are detected,
exposing the thermodynamic nature of these pulses. Finally, these pulses are
excitable only beyond a threshold for protonation, determined by the pKa of the
lipid head groups. When combined with an enzymatic pH-optimum, the proposed
communication can be very specific, thus providing a new physical basis for
intra- and intercellular signaling via two-dimensional sound waves at

femtosecond optical pulses with broad-band spectrum in gases. The vector
character of the nonlinear third-order polarization is investigated in details,
taking into account the carrier to envelope phase. The corresponding system of
vector amplitude equations is written by using left-hand and right-hand
circular components of the electrical field. We found that this system
nonlinear equations admits $3D+1$ vector soliton solution with Lorentz shape.
The solution presents relatively stable propagation and rotation with GHz

direction of propagation. The evolution of the intensity profile demonstrate
weak self-compression and week spherical wave in the first milliseconds of
propagation.

the interplay between the dynamics of the graph's units and the microscopic
arrangement of the network's structure. For non identical elements, the lack of
quantitative tools has hampered so far a systematic study of the mechanisms
behind such a collective behavior. We here propose an effective network whose
topological properties reflect the interplay between the topology and dynamics
of the original network. On that basis, we are able to introduce the
""synchronization centrality"", a measure which quantifies the role and
importance of each network's node in the synchronization process. In
particular, we use such a measure to assess the propensity of a graph to
synchronize explosively, thus indicating a unified framework for most of the
different models proposed so far for such an irreversible transition. Taking
advantage of the predicting power of this measure, we furthermore discuss a
strategy to induce the explosive behavior in a generic network, by acting only
upon a small fraction of its nodes.

preparing specific coherent superpositions in the initial manifold, full

conditions are studied by Monte Carlo simulations with the pruned-enriched
Rosenbluth method up to the chain length $N \sim {\cal O}(10^4)$. Based on the
standard simple cubic lattice model (SCLM) with fixed bond length and the bond
fluctuation model (BFM) with bond lengths in a range between $2$ and
$\sqrt{10}$, we investigate the conformations of polymer chains described by
self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on the simple cubic lattice, and by random walks
(RWs) and non-reversible random walks (NRRWs) in the absence of excluded volume
(EV) interactions. In addition to flexible chains, we also extend our study to
semiflexible chains for different stiffness controlled by a bending potential.
The persistence lengths of chains extracted from the orientational correlations
are estimated for all cases. We show that chains based on the BFM are more
flexible than those based on the SCLM for a fixed bending energy. The
microscopic differences between these two lattice models are discussed and the
theoretical predictions of scaling laws given in the literature are checked and
verified. Our simulations clarify that a different mapping ratio between the
coarse-grained models and the atomistically realistic description of polymers
is required in a coarse-graining approach due to the different crossovers to
the asymptotic behavior.

demonstrate an iron-oxide and graphene oxide nanocomposite based device that

transition temperature in a wide range of temperatures around room temperature,
but the magnetization can also be tuned from zero to 0.011 A.m$^2$/kg through
an initialization process with two readily accessible knobs (magnetic field and

semi-permanently until the next initialization process. We construct a
theoretical model to illustrate that this tunability originates from an
indirect exchange interaction mediated by spin-imbalanced electrons inside the

  Keywords: Bequest motive, consumption, optimal investment, stochastic control",,,,"q-fin.MF math.OC math.PR q-fin.PM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We determine the optimal strategy for investing in a Black-Scholes market in
order to maximize the probability that wealth at death meets a bequest goal
$b$, a type of goal-seeking problem, as pioneered by Dubins and Savage (1965,
1976). The individual consumes at a constant rate $c$, so the level of wealth
required for risklessly meeting consumption equals $c/r$, in which $r$ is the
rate of return of the riskless asset.
  Our problem is related to, but different from, the goal-reaching problems of
Browne (1997). First, Browne (1997, Section 3.1) maximizes the probability that
wealth reaches $b < c/r$ before it reaches $a < b$. Browne's game ends when
wealth reaches $b$. By contrast, for the problem we consider, the game
continues until the individual dies or until wealth reaches 0; reaching $b$ and
then falling below it before death does not count.
  Second, Browne (1997, Section 4.2) maximizes the expected discounted reward
of reaching $b > c/r$ before wealth reaches $c/r$. If one interprets his
discount rate as a hazard rate, then our two problems are {\it mathematically}
equivalent for the special case for which $b > c/r$, with ruin level $c/r$.
However, we obtain different results because we set the ruin level at 0,
thereby allowing the game to continue when wealth falls below $c/r$.

region of pp collisions at 8TeV centre-of-mass energy is presented. The
measurement is based on a sample of $\rm Z\rightarrow e^+e^-$ decays
reconstructed using the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 2.0fb$^{-1}$. The acceptance is defined by the requirements
$2.0<\eta<4.5$ and $p_{\rm T}>20$GeV for the pseudorapidities and transverse
momenta of the leptons. Their invariant mass is required to lie in the range
60--120GeV. The cross-section is determined to be $$ \sigma({\rm pp\to Z\to
e^+e^-})=93.81\pm0.41({\rm stat})\pm1.48({\rm syst})\pm1.14({\rm lumi})\;{\rm

systematic effects apart from that arising from the luminosity, which is given
as the third uncertainty. Differential cross-sections are presented as
functions of the Z-boson rapidity and of the angular variable $\phi^*$, which
is related to the Z-boson transverse momentum.

flexible and moderately stiff chains in the bond fluctuation model at a volume
fraction $0.5$. In order to reduce the local density fluctuations, we test a
pre-packing process for the preparation of the initial configurations of the
polymer melts, before the excluded volume interaction is switched on
completely. This process leads to a significantly faster decrease of the number
of overlapping monomers on the lattice. This is useful for simulating very
large systems, where the statistical properties of the model with a marginally
incomplete elimination of excluded volume violations are the same as those of
the model with strictly excluded volume. We find that the internal mean square
end-to-end distance for moderately stiff chains in a melt can be very well
described by a freely rotating chain model with a precise estimate of the
bond-bond orientational correlation between two successive bond vectors in
equilibrium. The plot of the probability distributions of the reduced
end-to-end distance of chains of different stiffness also shows that the data
collapse is excellent and described very well by the Gaussian distribution for
ideal chains. However, while our results confirm the systematic deviations
between Gaussian statistics for the chain structure factor $S_c(q)$ [minimum in
the Kratky-plot] found by Wittmer et al.~\{EPL {\bf 77} 56003 (2007).\} for
fully flexible chains in a melt, we show that for the available chain length
these deviations are no longer visible, when the chain stiffness is included.
The mean square bond length and the compressibility estimated from collective
structure factors depend slightly on the stiffness of the chains.

that a small spontaneous side curvature perpendicular to the rod can
drastically alter the tubulation dynamics at high protein density, whereas no
significant difference is obtained at low density. A percolated network is
intermediately formed depending on the side curvature. This network suppresses
tubule protrusion, leading to the slow formation of fewer tubules. Thus, the
side curvature, which is generated by protein--protein and membrane--protein
interactions, plays a significant role in tubulation dynamics. We also find
that positive surface tensions and the vesicle membrane curvature can stabilize
this network structure by suppressing the tubulation.

only 39\% of them occur in a wind-like medium. Only 9 cases have afterglow
light-curves that exactly match the standard fireball model prediction, having
a single power law decay in both energy bands which are observed during their

additional model assumptions must be made over limited segments of the

corresponding to the material and Alfv\'en waves are linearly degenerate and,
then, not affected by the convexity issue. The analysis of the characteristic
fields associated with the magnetosonic waves reveals, however, a dependence of
the convexity condition on the magnetic field. The result is expressed in the
form of a generalized fundamental derivative written as the sum of two terms.
The first one is the generalized fundamental derivative in the case of purely
hydrodynamical (relativistic) flow. The second one contains the effects of the

the flare abundances of Si and Ar are very close to the photospheric abundance

referenced over geographic regions and time; however, there are relatively few
general statistical methods that one can readily use that incorporate these
multivariate spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, many multivariate
spatio-temporal areal data sets are extremely high dimensional, which leads to
practical issues when formulating statistical models. For example, we analyze
Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) published by the US Census Bureau's
Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. QWIs are available by
different variables, regions, and time points, resulting in millions of
tabulations. Despite their already expansive coverage, by adopting a fully
Bayesian framework, the scope of the QWIs can be extended to provide estimates
of missing values along with associated measures of uncertainty. Motivated by
the LEHD, and other applications in federal statistics, we introduce the
multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM), which can be used to
efficiently model high-dimensional multivariate spatio-temporal areal data
sets. The proposed MSTM extends the notion of Moran's I basis functions to the
multivariate spatio-temporal setting. This extension leads to several
methodological contributions, including extremely effective dimension
reduction, a dynamic linear model for multivariate spatio-temporal areal
processes, and the reduction of a high-dimensional parameter space using a
novel parameter model.

models is contained in this report. Those models are used widely for many of
the applications in diverse fields of interest, such as surface physics, theory
of chemisorption and adsorbate reactions on metal surfaces, physics of
intermediate valence systems, theory of heavy fermions, physics of quantum dots
and other nanostructures. While standard treatments are generally based on
perturbation methods, our approach is based on the non-perturbative technique
for the thermodynamic Green functions. The method of the irreducible Green
functions is used as the basic tool. This irreducible Green functions method
allows one to describe the quasiparticle spectra with damping of the strongly
correlated electron systems in a very general and natural way and to construct
the relevant dynamical solution in a self-consistent way on the level of Dyson
equation without decoupling the chain of the equations of motion for the Green
functions. The subject matter includes the improved interpolating solution of
the Anderson model. It was shown that an interpolating approximation, which
simultaneously reproduces the weak-coupling limit up to second order in the
interaction strength U and the strong-coupling limit up to second order in the
hybridization V (and thus also fulfils the atomic limit) can be formulated
self-consistently. This approach offers a new way for the systematic
construction of approximate interpolation dynamical solutions of strongly
correlated electron systems.

liquid contained between and within the hexagonal structures. It has been
hypothesized that this configuration creates adhesion by allowing for long
range capillary forces, or alternatively, by allowing for exit of the liquid
and thus improving contact of the toe pad. In this work we suggest interaction
between viscosity and elasticity as a mechanism to create temporary adhesion,
even in the absence of capillary effects or van der Waals forces. We initially
illustrate this concept experimentally by a simplified configuration consisting
of two surfaces connected by a liquid bridge and elastic springs. We then
utilize poroelastic mixture theory and model frog's toe pads as an elastic
porous medium, immersed within a viscous liquid and pressed against a rigid
rough surface. The flow between the surface and the toe pad is modeled by the
lubrication approximation. Inertia is neglected and analysis of the
elastic-viscous dynamics yields a governing partial differential equation
describing the flow and stress within the porous medium. Several solutions of
the governing equation are presented and show a temporary adhesion due to
stress created at the contact surface between the solids. This work thus may
explain how some frogs (such as the torrent frog) maintain adhesion underwater
and the reason for the periodic repositioning of frogs' toe pads during
adhesion to surfaces.

evolution phase, we employ the AMPT model that explicitly includes
event-by-event fluctuations in the number and positions of the participating
nucleons as well as of the produced partons with subsequent parton transport.
The ensuing near-equilibrium evolution of quark-gluon and hadronic matter is
modeled within the (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics. We probe the role
of parton dynamics in generating and maintaining the spatial anisotropy in the
preequilibrium phase. Substantial eccentricities epsilon_n are found to be
generated in the event-by-event fluctuations in parton production from initial
nucleon-nucleon collisions. For ultracentral heavy-ion collisions, the model is
able to explain qualitatively the unexpected hierarchy of the harmonic flow
coefficients v_n(p_T)(n=2-6) observed at LHC. We find that the results for
v_n(p_T) are rather insensitive to the variation (within a range) of the time
of switchover from AMPT parton transport to hydrodynamic evolution. The usual
Grad and the recently proposed Chapman-Enskog-like (nonequilibrium)
single-particle distribution functions are found to give very similar results
for v_n(n=2-4). The model describes well both the RHIC and LHC data for
v_n(p_T) at various centralities, with a constant shear viscosity to entropy
density ratio of 0.08 and 0.12, respectively. The event-by-event distributions
of v_{2,3} are in good agreement with the LHC data for midcentral collisions.
The linear response relation v_n = k_n epsilon_n is found to be true for n=2,3,
except at large values of epsilon_n, where a larger value of k_n is required,
suggesting a small admixture of positive nonlinear response even for n=2,3.
