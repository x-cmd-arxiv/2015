recent years. On the one hand, these DLs are tractable, but fairly
inexpressive. On the other hand, these DLs can be used for designing different
classes of ontologies, most notably ontologies from the medical domain.
Unfortunately, building ontologies is error-prone. As a result, inferable
subsumption relations among concepts may be unintended. In recent years, the
problem of axiom pinpointing has been studied with the purpose of providing
minimal sets of axioms that explain unintended subsumption relations. For the
concrete case of EL and EL+, the most efficient approaches consist of encoding
the problem into propositional logic, specifically as a Horn formula, which is
then analyzed with a dedicated algorithm. This paper builds on this earlier
work, but exploits the important relationship between minimal axioms sets and
minimal unsatisfiable subformulas in the propositional domain. In turn, this
relationship allows applying a vast body of recent work in the propositional
domain to the concrete case of axiom pinpointing for EL and its variants. From
a practical perspective, the algorithms described in this paper are often
several orders of magnitude more efficient that the current state of the art in
axiom pinpointing for the EL family of DLs.

examined in an idealized two-dimensional model of a proto-stellar disc,

fluid with constant density except for a single density interface at some
radius r0. The fluid in basic state is prescribed to rotate with a Keplerian
profile $\Omega_k(r)\sim r^{-3/2}$ modified by some additional azimuthal
sheared flow. A linear analysis shows that there are two azimuthally
propagating edge waves, kin to the familiar Rossby waves and surface gravity
waves in terrestrial studies, which move opposite to one another with respect
to the local basic state rotation rate at the interface. Instability only
occurs if the radial pressure gradient is opposite to that of the density jump
(unstably stratified) where self-gravity acts as a wave stabilizer irrespective
of the stratification of the system. The propagation properties of the waves
are discussed in detail in the language of vorticity edge waves. The roles of
both Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq effects upon the stability and propagation
of these waves with and without the inclusion of self-gravity are then
quantified. The dynamics involved with self-gravity non- Boussinesq effect is
shown to be a source of vorticity production where there is a jump in the basic
state density, in addition, self-gravity also alters the dynamics via the
radial main pressure gradient, which is a Boussinesq effect . Further
applications of these mechanical insights are presented in the conclusion

a nonnegative real number, called matching weight. For dimensionality
reduction, we consider a linear transformation of data vectors, and define a
matching error as the weighted sum of squared distances between transformed
vectors with respect to the matching weights. Given data vectors and matching
weights, the optimal linear transformation minimizing the matching error is
solved by the spectral graph embedding of Yan et al. (2007). This method is a
generalization of the canonical correlation analysis, and will be called as
matching correlation analysis (MCA). In this paper, we consider a novel
sampling scheme where the observed matching weights are randomly sampled from
underlying true matching weights with small probability, whereas the data
vectors are treated as constants. We then investigate a cross-validation by
resampling the matching weights. Our asymptotic theory shows that the
cross-validation, if rescaled properly, computes an unbiased estimate of the
matching error with respect to the true matching weights. Existing ideas of
cross-validation for resampling data vectors, instead of resampling matching
weights, are not applicable here. MCA can be used for data vectors from
multiple domains with different dimensions via an embarrassingly simple idea of
coding the data vectors. This method will be called as cross-domain matching

coordination between the data production and the analysis phases hinges on the
availability of metadata that describe the scientific datasets. Existing

provenance information about the identity and lineage of the data. However,
much of the data produced by simulations, experiments, and analyses still need
to be annotated manually in an ad hoc manner by domain scientists. Systematic

hand, few real-time measurements are traditionally available, and operation is
often conducted based on predicted and historical data. Today, in many parts of

measurements could in principle be shared with the operators in real time to
enable improved state estimation. However, customers may feel reluctance in
doing so due to privacy concerns. We therefore propose state estimation schemes
for a distribution grid model, which ensure differential privacy to the
customers. In particular, the state estimation schemes optimize different
performance criteria, and a trade-off between a lower bound on the estimation
performance versus the customers' differential privacy is derived. The proposed

column density of free electrons to a pulsar, caused by multipath scattering
from small scale electron-density fluctuations. The DM is slightly different
along each propagation path and the transverse spread of paths varies greatly
with frequency, yielding time-of-arrival (TOA) perturbations that scale
differently than the inverse square of the frequency, the expected dependence
for a cold, unmagnetized plasma. We quantify DM and TOA perturbations
analytically for thin phase screens and extended media and verify the results
with simulations of thin screens. The rms difference between DMs across an
octave band near 1.5~GHz $\sim 4\times10^{-5}\,{\rm pc\ cm^{-3}}$ for pulsars
at $\sim 1$~kpc distance. TOA errors from chromatic DMs are of order a few to
hundreds of nanoseconds for pulsars with DM $\lesssim 30$~pc~cm$^{-3}$ observed
across an octave band but increase rapidly to microseconds or larger for larger
DMs and wider frequency ranges. Frequency-dependent DMs introduce correlated
noise into timing residuals whose power spectrum is `low pass' in form. The
correlation time is of order the geometric mean of the refraction times for the
highest and lowest radio frequencies used and thus ranges from days to years,
depending on the pulsar. We discuss the implications for methodologies that use
large frequency separations or wide bandwidth receivers for timing
measurements. Chromatic DMs are partially mitigable by using an additional
chromatic term in arrival time models. Without mitigation, our results provide
an additional term in the noise model for pulsar timing; they also indicate
that in combination with measurement errors from radiometer noise, an arbitrary
increase in total frequency range (or bandwidth) will yield diminishing
benefits and may be detrimental to overall timing precision.

storing a polarized beam of ""frozen spin"" particles in an all-electric storage
ring. Only one such relativistic electric accelerator has ever been built---the
""Electron Analogue"" ring at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1954. By chance
this electron ring, long since dismantled, would have been appropriate both for
measuring the electron EDM and to serve as an inexpensive prototype for the
arguably more promising, but ten times more expensive, proton EDM measurement.
  Today it is cheaper yet to ""resurrect"" the Electron Analogue ring by
simulating its performance computationally. This is one purpose for the present
paper. To set up these calculations has required a kind of ""archeological

UAL/ETEAPOT code, described in detail in an accompanying paper, has been
developed for modeling storage ring performance, including (exact BMT) spin
evolution, in electric rings. Illustrating its use, comparing its predictions

evolution and code performance, are other goals of the paper.

applied the method to a slow CME with an average leading edge speed about 480

elements stay almost constant within 2 and 15 R$_S$, the range over which we
analyzed the CME. Hence we have no evidence of net radial forces acting on
parts of the CME in this range nor of a pile-up of mass ahead of the CME. We
find evidence that the leading edge trajectory obtained by tie-pointing may
gradually lag behind the Lagrangian front-side trajectories derived from our

this aggregation allows researchers to build defect prediction models. Recent
findings by Landman et al. indicate that aggregation is likely to inflate the
correlation between size and complexity metrics. In this paper, we explore the
effect of nine aggregation techniques on the correlation between three types of
code metrics, namely Lines of Code, McCabe, and Halstead metrics. In addition
to summation, we study aggregation techniques that are measures of: (1) central
tendency (average and median), (2) dispersion (standard deviation and
inter-quartile range), (3) shape (skewness and kurtosis), and (4) income
inequality (Theil index and Gini coefficient). Our results show that defect

aggregation techniques. We also find that more complex aggregations are no
different than much simpler ones and that incorporating all aggregation types
in the same model does not provide a significant improvement over using
summation alone.

changes the distance-redshift relation $D(z)$ or the mean flux density of
sources. Interest in this has been rekindled by recent studies in non-linear
relativistic perturbation theory that find biases in both the area of a surface
of constant redshift and in the mean distance to this surface, with a
fractional bias in both cases on the order of the mean squared convergence
$\langle \kappa^2 \rangle$. Any such area bias could alter CMB cosmology, and
the corresponding bias in mean flux density could affect supernova cosmology.
Here we show that, in an ensemble averaged sense, the perturbation to the area
of a surface of constant redshift is in reality much smaller, being on the
order of the cumulative bending angle squared, or roughly a part-in-a-million
effect. This validates the arguments of Weinberg (1976) that the mean
magnification $\mu$ of sources is unity and of Kibble \& Lieu (2005) that the
mean direction-averaged inverse magnification is unity. It also validates the
conventional treatment of lensing in analysis of CMB anisotropies. But the
existence of a scatter in magnification will cause any non-linear function of
these conserved quantities to be statistically biased. The distance $D$, for
example, is proportional to $\mu^{-1/2}$ so lensing will bias $\langle
D\rangle$ even if $\langle \mu \rangle=1$. The fractional bias in such
quantities is generally of order $\langle \kappa^2 \rangle$, which is orders of
magnitude larger than the area perturbation. Claims for large bias in area or
flux density of sources appear to have resulted from misinterpretation of such
effects: they do not represent a new non-Newtonian effect, nor do they
invalidate standard cosmological analyses.

x 10d12Msun, with 1 sigma dispersion in the range [0.86, 3.1] x 10d12Msun,
consistent with dynamical measurements of the Milky Way halo mass. For any
given halo mass, the probability of hosting a Milky Way system is low, with a
maximum of ~20% in haloes of mass ~10d12Msun. The model reproduces the V-band
luminosity function and radial profile of the bright (MV < -9) Milky Way
satellites. Galaxy formation in low mass haloes is found to be highly
stochastic, resulting in an extremely large scatter in the relation between MV
(or stellar mass) for satellites and the depth of the subhalo potential well in
which they live, as measured by the maximum of the rotation curve, Vmax. We
conclude that the ""too big to fail"" problem is an artifact of selecting
satellites in N-body simulations according to subhalo properties: in 10% of
cases we find that three or fewer of the brightest (or most massive) satellites

potential is then solved exactly with a finite element method, leading
ultimately to a sparse matrix problem that is solved efficiently with standard
multigrid methods. Moreover, since this system represents an exact

  We show that if a sequence {V_n} of W_n-representations has the structure of

presenting a new information-theoretic metric for security, called symbol
secrecy, and derive associated fundamental bounds. We then introduce
list-source codes (LSCs), which are a general framework for mapping a key
length (entropy) to a list size that an eavesdropper has to resolve in order to
recover a secret message. We provide explicit constructions of LSCs, and
demonstrate that, when the source is uniformly distributed, the highest level
of symbol secrecy for a fixed key length can be achieved through a construction
based on minimum-distance separable (MDS) codes. Using an analysis related to
rate-distortion theory, we then show how symbol secrecy can be used to
determine the probability that an eavesdropper correctly reconstructs functions
of the original plaintext. We illustrate how these bounds can be applied to
characterize security properties of symmetric-key encryption schemes, and, in

closeness centrality of a node, is a popular importance measure in the study of

the distance relation via weighted sampling. Based on that, we present highly
practical algorithms with strong statistical guarantees for fundamental
problems. We show that the average distance (and hence the centrality) for all

that after preprocessing which uses $O(n)$ distance computations we can compute
a weighted sample $S\subset V$ of size $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ such that the average
distance from any query point $v$ to $V$ can be estimated from the distances
from $v$ to $S$. Finally, we show that for a set of points $V$ in a metric

distance computations. The estimate is based on a weighted sample of
$O(\epsilon^{-2})$ pairs of points, which is computed using $O(n)$ distance
computations. Our estimates are unbiased with normalized mean square error
(NRMSE) of at most $\epsilon$. Increasing the sample size by a $O(\log n)$
factor ensures that the probability that the relative error exceeds $\epsilon$

e^-$ collider as well. We exploit the pair production in association with a
hard photon radiation in high energy $e^+ e^-$ collisions. If kinematically
accessible, such single-photon processes at $e^+e^-$ colliders with polarized
beams enable us to characterize each scenario by measuring the energy and
scattering angle of the associated hard photon, and to determine the spin of
the nearly invisible particles unambiguously through the threshold behavior in
the photon energy distribution.

topics from a document network. Many theoretical and practical tasks, such as
dimensional reduction, document clustering, link prediction, benefit from this
revealed knowledge. However, existing relational topic models are based on an
assumption that the number of hidden topics is known in advance, and this is
impractical in many real-world applications. Therefore, in order to relax this
assumption, we propose a nonparametric relational topic model in this paper.
Instead of using fixed-dimensional probability distributions in its generative
model, we use stochastic processes. Specifically, a gamma process is assigned
to each document, which represents the topic interest of this document.
Although this method provides an elegant solution, it brings additional
challenges when mathematically modeling the inherent network structure of
typical document network, i.e., two spatially closer documents tend to have
more similar topics. Furthermore, we require that the topics are shared by all
the documents. In order to resolve these challenges, we use a subsampling
strategy to assign each document a different gamma process from the global
gamma process, and the subsampling probabilities of documents are assigned with
a Markov Random Field constraint that inherits the document network structure.
Through the designed posterior inference algorithm, we can discover the hidden
topics and its number simultaneously. Experimental results on both synthetic
and real-world network datasets demonstrate the capabilities of learning the
hidden topics and, more importantly, the number of topics.

fact that the equation in self-similar variables is not autonomous and we do
not have a specific analyitcal solution. Therefore, in order to quantify the
latter convergence, we estimate attraction to a time-dependent
""pseudo-equilibrium"", which in turn converges to the stationnary profile.

corresponds to a regular extremal black hole with degenerate horizon, and
$a_{E}$ decreases and $r_{H}^{E}$ increases with increase in $g$. While
$a<a_{E}$ describe a regular non-extremal black hole with outer and inner

observed at 0.36"" scale by Diaz-Santos et al. We found a 2.2um compact source
at the S nucleus in a HST NICMOS image and identified its unresolved core (at
0.26"" resolution) with the compact core in previous mid-infrared observations
at comparable resolution. The flux of the 2.2umm core is consistent with our
AGN spectral energy distribution model. We also analyzed a deeper than ever
Chandra X-ray spectrum of the unresolved (at 0.5"" resolution) source at the S

include the renormalization effects on the Wilson coefficients of the

the threshold corrections to these coefficients at the one-loop level in the
minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT and the extended one with additional SU(5)

enhanced about 5% in the minimal setup, and then the enhancement could become
smaller in the vector-like matter extensions.

relationship with solar activity. Before the launch of SDO, earlier studies
have mostly used MDI/SOHO line of sight magnetograms and assumed that magnetic
fields are radial when calculating magnetic helicity injection rate from
photospheric magnetograms. However, this assumption is not necessarily true.
Here we use the vector magnetograms and line of sight magnetograms, both taken
by HMI/SDO, to estimate the effects of non-radial magnetic field on measuring
magnetic helicity injection rate. We find that: 1) The effect of non-radial
magnetic field on estimating tangential velocity is relatively small; 2) On
estimating magnetic helicity injection rate, the effect of non-radial magnetic
field is strong when active regions are observed near the limb and is
relatively small when active regions are close to disk center; 3) The effect of
non-radial magnetic field becomes minor if the amount of accumulated magnetic
helicity is the only concern.

perform multi-phase hydrodynamic simulations to analyze the stability of Bok
globules. We show that a high-density soft molecular core, with an adiabatic
index $\gamma$ = 0.7 embedded in a warm isothermal diffuse gas, must have a
small density gradient to retain the stability. Despite being stable, the
molecular core can still collapse spontaneously as it will relax to develop a
sufficiently large density gradient after tens of oscillations, or a few $10^7$
years. However, during its relaxation, the core may abruptly collapse triggered
by the impingement of small-amplitude, long-wavelength ($\sim$ 6 $-$ 36 pc)
sound waves in the warm gas. This triggered collapse mechanism is similar to a
sonoluminescence phenomenon, where underwater ultrasounds can drive air bubble
coalescence. The collapse configuration is found to be different from both
inside-out and outside-in models of low-mass star formation; nonetheless the
mass flux is close to the prediction of the inside-out model. The condition and
the efficiency for this core collapse mechanism are identified. Generally
speaking, a broad-band resonance condition must be met, where the core
oscillation frequency and the wave frequency should match each other within a
factor of several. A consequence of our findings predicts the possibility of
propagating low-mass star formation, for which collapse of cores, within a mass
range short of one order of magnitude, takes place sequentially tracing the
wave front across a region of few tens of pc over $10^7$ years.

former arise from the coupling between 0d$\_{5/2}$ protons and a 0d$\_{3/2}$

well reproduced with the USDA interaction in the N=17 isotones, a progressive
shift in the ground state binding energy (by about 500 keV) is observed between
$^{26}$F and $^{30}$Al. This points to a possible change in the proton-neutron
0d$\_{5/2}$-0d$\_{3/2}$ effective interaction when moving from stability to the
drip line. The presence of J$^{\pi}$=1-4$^-$ negative parity states around 1.5

further support to the collapse of the N=20 gap and to the inversion between

in the framework of Shell Model and EDF calculations, leading to predicted

problem was recast in the systematic study of walks with small steps (that

regularization of inverse problems in imaging. It performs a nearest neighbor
interpolation of the spikes locations on the sampling grid. The C-BP method,
introduced by Ekanadham, Tranchina and Simoncelli, uses a linear interpolation
of the locations to perform a better approximation of the infinite-dimensional
optimization problem, for positive measures. We show that, in the small noise
regime, both methods estimate twice the number of spikes as the number of
original spikes. Indeed, we show that they both detect two neighboring spikes
around the locations of an original spikes. These results for deconvolution
problems are based on an abstract analysis of the so-called extended support of
the solutions of L1-type problems (including as special cases the Lasso and
C-BP for deconvolution), which are of an independent interest. They precisely
characterize the support of the solutions when the noise is small and the
regularization parameter is selected accordingly. We illustrate these findings
to analyze for the first time the support instability of compressed sensing
recovery when the number of measurements is below the critical limit (well
documented in the literature) where the support is provably stable.

a large building where the RAPs are connected via fibre and many cells are

computational resources. A new analytical framework is proposed for quantifying
the computational load associated with the centralized processing of uplink

including computational outage probability, outage complexity, computational

of the analytical framework is confirmed by comparing it numerically with a
simulator compliant with the 3GPP LTE standard. Using the developed metrics, it
is shown that centralizing the computing resources provides a higher net

all higher dimensions, focusing on slowly rotating charged AdS black holes with
a single angular momentum. We divide the spacetime of these black holes into
the near-horizon and far regions and find solutions to the scalar wave equation
in each of these regions. Next, we perform the matching of these solutions in
the overlap between the regions, by employing the idea that the orbital quantum

the complete low-frequency solution that allows us to calculate the complex
frequency spectrum of quasinormal modes, whose imaginary part is determined by
a small damping parameter. Finally, we find a remarkably instructive expression
for the damping parameter, which appears to be a complex quantity in general.

  time series","64 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important assumption in the work on testing for structural breaks in time
series consists in the fact that the model is formulated such that the
stochastic process under the null hypothesis of ""no change-point"" is
stationary. This assumption is crucial to derive (asymptotic) critical values
for the corresponding testing procedures using an elegant and powerful
mathematical theory, but it might be not very realistic from a practical point
of view.
  This paper develops change point analysis under less restrictive assumptions
and deals with the problem of detecting change points in the marginal variance
and correlation structures of a non-stationary time series. A CUSUM approach is
proposed, which is used to test the ""classical"" hypothesis of the form $H_0:
\theta_1=\theta_2$ vs. $H_1: \theta_1 \not =\theta_2$, where $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ denote second order parameters of the process before and after a
change point. The asymptotic distribution of the CUSUM test statistic is
derived under the null hypothesis. This distribution depends in a complicated
way on the dependency structure of the nonlinear non-stationary time series and
a bootstrap approach is developed to generate critical values. The results are
then extended to test the hypothesis of a {\it non relevant change point}, i.e.
$H_0: | \theta_1-\theta_2 | \leq \delta$, which reflects the fact that
inference should not be changed, if the difference between the parameters
before and after the change-point is small.
  In contrast to previous work, our approach does neither require the mean to
be constant nor - in the case of testing for lag $k$-correlation - that the
mean, variance and fourth order joint cumulants are constant under the null
hypothesis. In particular, we allow that the variance has a change point at a
different location than the auto-covariance.

kinematics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the thermal energy release
traced by the related soft X-ray (SXR) emission. The major problem of empirical
studies of this relationship is the distortion of the CME speed by the
projection effect in the coronagraphic measurements. We present a re-assessment
of the statistical relationship between CME velocities and SXR parameters,
using the SOHO/LASCO catalog and GOES whole Sun observations during the period
1996 to 2008. 49 events were identified where CMEs originated near the limb, at
central meridian distances between 70$^\circ$ and 85$^\circ$, and had a
reliably identified SXR burst, the parameters of which - peak flux and fluence
- could be determined with some confidence. We find similar correlations
between the logarithms of CME speed and of SXR peak flux and fluence as several
earlier studies, with correlation coefficients of 0.48 and 0.58, respectively.
Correlations are slightly improved over an unrestricted CME sample when only
limb events are used. However, a broad scatter persists. We derive the
parameters of the CME-SXR relationship and use them to predict ICME arrival
times at Earth. We show that the CME speed inferred from SXR fluence
measurements tends to perform better than SoHO/LASCO measurements in the
prediction of ICME arrival times near 1 AU. The estimation of the CME speed
from SXR observations can therefore make a valuable contribution to space
weather predictions.

framework that considers both the load-dependent energy radiated by the

stations. The objective is to reduce the energy consumption of mobile networks,
while ensuring that the data rate requirements of the users are met throughout
the coverage area. Building upon sparse optimization techniques, we develop a
majorization-minimization algorithm with the ability to identify
energy-efficient network configurations. The iterative algorithm is load-aware,
has low computational complexity, and can be implemented in an online fashion
to exploit load fluctuations on a short time scale. Simulations show that the
algorithm can find network configurations with the energy consumption similar
to that obtained with global optimization tools, which cannot be applied to
real large networks. Although we consider only one currently deployed cellular
technology, the optimization framework is general, potentially applicable to a
large class of access technologies.

Higgs boson. This boson plays a central role in a symmetry breaking scheme

the standard model realistic. However, until recently at least, the
50-year-long-sought Higgs boson had remained the only particle in the standard
model not yet discovered experimentally. It is the last but very important
missing ingredient of the standard model. Therefore, searching for the Higgs
boson is a crucial task and an important mission of particle physics. For this
purpose, many theoretical works have been done and different experiments have
been organized. It may be said in particular that to search for the Higgs boson
has been one of the ultimate goals of building and running the LHC, the world's
largest and most powerful particle accelerator, at CERN, which is a great
combination of science and technology. Recently, in the summer of 2012, ATLAS
and CMS, the two biggest and general-purpose LHC collaborations, announced the
discovery of a new boson with a mass around 125 GeV. Since then, for over two
years, ATLAS, CMS and other collaborations have carried out intensive
investigations on the newly discovered boson to confirm that this new boson is
really the Higgs boson (of the standard model). It is a triumph of science and
technology and international cooperation. Here, we will review the main results
of these investigations following a brief introduction to the Higgs boson
within the theoretical framework of the standard model and Brout-Englert-Higgs
mechanism as well as a theoretical and experimental background of its search.

The Hamiltonians possess two unusual features, however. First, they involve the
standard kinetic term only for one degree of freedom, while the remaining
variables provide contributions linear in momenta. This is typical for
Ostrogradsky's canonical approach to the description of higher derivative
systems. Second, the Hamiltonian in the second paper is not Hermitian in the

Hamiltonians and demonstrate that the first of them is equivalent to the
Hamiltonian describing free higher derivative nonrelativistic particles, while
the second can be linked to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator whose frequencies

discovered in 2011 when it went into outburst. In this paper, we present the
full radio monitoring of this system during its `failed' outburst, in which the
source did not complete a full set of state changes, only transitioning as far
as the hard intermediate state. Observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) show that the jet
properties changed significantly during the outburst. The VLA observations
detected linearly polarised emission at a level of ~1% early in the outburst,
increasing to ~3% as the outburst peaked. High-resolution images with the Very
Long Baseline Array (VLBA) show a ~15 mas jet along the position angle $-21 \pm
2^\circ$, in agreement with the electric vector position angle found from our
polarisation results ($-21 \pm 4^\circ$), implying that the magnetic field is
perpendicular to the jet. Astrometric observations suggest that the system
required an asymmetric natal kick to explain its observed space velocity.
Comparing quasi-simultaneous X-ray monitoring with the 5 GHz VLA observations
from the 2011 outburst shows an unusually steep hard-state radio/X-ray
correlation of $L_{\rm R} \propto L_{\rm X}^{1.8\pm0.2}$, where $L_{\rm R}$ and
$L_{\rm X}$ denote the radio and X-ray luminosities, respectively. With ATCA
and Swift monitoring of the source during a period of re-brightening in 2012,
we show that the system lay on the same steep correlation. Due to the low
inclination of this system, we then investigate the possibility that the
observed correlation may have been steepened by variable Doppler boosting.

distributions through Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed capacity-achieving
input distributions are circularly symmetric, non-Gaussian, and the input
amplitudes are correlated over time. The evaluated capacity bounds are tight
for a wide range of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) values, and thus they can be
used to quantify the capacity. Specifically, the bounds follow the well-known
AWGN capacity curve at low SNR, while at high SNR, they coincide with the
high-SNR capacity result available in the literature for the phase-noise
channel.

using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), with two impurity solvers, namely,
iterated perturbation theory (IPT) and continuous time quantum Monte Carlo
(CTQMC). The physics of the IHM is governed by the competition between the
staggered potential $\Delta$ and the on-site Hubbard U. In both the methods we
find that for a finite $\Delta$ and at zero temperature, anti-ferromagnetic
(AFM) order sets in beyond a threshold $U=U_{AF}$ via a first order phase
transition below which the system is a paramagnetic band insulator. Both the
methods show a clear evidence for a transition to a half-metal phase just after
the AFM order is turned on, followed by the formation of an AFM insulator on
further increasing U. We show that the results obtained within both the methods
have good qualitative and quantitative consistency in the intermediate to
strong coupling regime. On increasing the temperature, the AFM order is lost
via a first order phase transition at a transition temperature $T_{AF}(U,
\Delta)$ within both the methods, for weak to intermediate values of U/t. But
in the strongly correlated regime, where the effective low energy Hamiltonian
is the Heisenberg model, IPT is unable to capture the thermal (Neel) transition
from the AFM phase to the paramagnetic phase, but the CTQMC does. As a result,
at any finite temperature T, DMFT+CTQMC shows a second phase transition (not
seen within DMFT+IPT) on increasing U beyond $U_{AF}$. At $U_N > U_{AF}$, when
the Neel temperature $T_N$ for the effective Heisenberg model becomes lower
than T, the AFM order is lost via a second order transition. In the
3-dimensonal parameter space of $(U/t,T/t,\Delta/t)$, there is a line of
tricritical points that separates the surfaces of first and second order phase
transitions.

selection methods in practical model selection problems, highlight their
differences and give recommendations about the preferred approaches. We focus
on the variable subset selection for regression and classification and perform
several numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data. The
results show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the
cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to
relatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This
can also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the
performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive viewpoint,
best results are obtained by accounting for model uncertainty by forming the
full encompassing model, such as the Bayesian model averaging solution over the
candidate models. If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly
simplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model
is projected onto the submodels. This approach is substantially less prone to
overfitting than selection based on CV-score. Overall, the projection method
appears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of
the most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the model
selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation outside the searching
process both for guiding the model size selection and assessing the predictive
performance of the finally selected model.

treated using Marginal Structural Models (MSM) relying on the counterfactual

incorporating biological knowledge when available, which leads to increased

Brent and Krapchenko. Brent's construction gives neither a bound on the fan-out

linear fan-out. With a fan-out bound of two, neither construction achieves a

an adder with linear size and fan-out two, but twice the depth of the

effects: a magnification of a source and a distortion of the sources shape in
the form of a shear. However, further distortions are actually present owing to
changes in the gravitational field across the scale of the ray bundle of light
propagating to us, resulting in the familiar arcs in lensed images. This is
normally called the flexion, and is approximated by Taylor expanding the shear
and magnification across the image plane. However, the physical origin of this
effect arises from higher-order corrections in the geodesic deviation equation
governing the gravitational force between neighbouring geodesics - so involves
derivatives of the Riemann tensor. We show that integrating the second-order
geodesic deviation equation results in a 'Hessian map' for gravitational
lensing, which is a higher-order addition to the Jacobi map. We derive the
general form of the Hessian map in an arbitrary spacetime paying particular
attention to the separate effects of local Ricci versus non-local Weyl
curvature. We then specialise to the case of a perturbed FLRW model, and give

intensity $\lambda_U$. Cell voidness, usually disregarded due to rarity in
cellular network modeling, is first theoretically analyzed under generalized
(channel-aware) cell association (GCA). We showed that the void cell
probability cannot be neglected any more since it is bounded above by
$\exp(-\lambda_U/\lambda_B)$ that is typically not small in a small cell
network. The accurate expression of the void cell probability for GCA was
characterized and it was used to derive the average cell and user throughputs.
We learned that cell association and cell load $\lambda_U/\lambda_B$
significantly affect these two throughputs. According to the average cell and
user throughputs, the green cell and user throughputs are defined respectively
to reflect whether the energy of a base station is efficiently used to transmit

high temperature and under extremely high shear rates. With increasing
temperature, dislocation deformation and grain boundary sliding is supplanted
by amorphization in a highly localized nanoscale band, which allows massive
strain and fracture. The mechanism is similar to shear melting and leads to
liquid metal embrittlement at high temperature. From simulation, we find that
the necessary conditions are, lack of dislocation slip systems, low thermal
conduction and temperature near the melting point. The first two are exhibited
by bcc titanium alloys, and we show that the final one can be achieved
experimentally by adding low-melting point elements: specifically we use
insoluble rare earth metals (REMs). Under high shear, the REM becomes mixed
with the titanium, lowering the melting point within the shear band and
triggering the shear-melting transition. This in turn generates heat which
remains localized in the shear band due to poor heat conduction. The material
fractures along the shear band. We show how to utilize this transition in the
creation of new titanium-based alloys with improved machinability.

sciences, including computer vision. In this CVPR 2015 paper, we discover that
a high-quality visual saliency model can be trained with multiscale features
extracted using a popular deep learning architecture, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), which have had many successes in visual recognition tasks. For
learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture,
which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for extracting
features at three different scales. We then propose a refinement method to
enhance the spatial coherence of our saliency results. Finally, aggregating
multiple saliency maps computed for different levels of image segmentation can
further boost the performance, yielding saliency maps better than those
generated from a single segmentation. To promote further research and
evaluation of visual saliency models, we also construct a new large database of
4447 challenging images and their pixelwise saliency annotation. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of achieving
state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmarks, improving the F-Measure
by 5.0% and 13.2% respectively on the MSRA-B dataset and our new dataset

(also known as $\Phi$-derivable, Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis or Luttinger-Ward
functionals depending on context) have been widely used in condensed matter and
non-equilibrium quantum/statistical field theory because this formalism gives a
robust, self-consistent, non-perturbative and systematically improvable
approach which avoids problems with secular time evolution. The strengths of
2PI approximations are often described in terms of a selective resummation of
Feynman diagrams to infinite order. However, the Feynman diagram series is
asymptotic and summation is at best a dangerous procedure. Here we show that,
at least in the context of a toy model where exact results are available, the
true strength of 2PI approximations derives from their self-consistency rather
than any resummation. This self-consistency allows truncated 2PI approximations
to capture the branch points of physical amplitudes where adjustments of
coupling constants can trigger an instability of the vacuum. This, in effect,
turns Dyson's argument for the failure of perturbation theory on its head. As a
result we find that 2PI approximations perform better than Pad\'e approximation
and are competitive with Borel-Pad\'e resummation. Finally, we introduce a
hybrid 2PI-Pad\'e method.

and, beyond to be one of the most famous card games, it represents a modern
challenge for scientists belonging to different communities, spanning from
artificial intelligence to physics and from psychology to mathematics. Unlike
games like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill
game' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem,
whose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal
winning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a
strategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore,
in order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances
of rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges. Recently,
a work on this topic revealed that rationality is a fundamental ingredient to
succeed in poker tournaments. In this study we analyze a simple model of poker
challenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the
nature of this game. As main result we found that, under particular conditions,
few irrational players can turn poker into gambling. Therefore, although
rationality is a key ingredient to succeed in poker, also the format of
challenges has an important role in these dynamics, as it can strongly
influence the underlying nature of the game. The importance of our results lies
on related implications, as for instance in identifying the limits poker can be
considered as a `skill game' and, as a consequence, which kind of format must
be chosen to devise algorithms able to face humans.

characteristic return time $\tau$, possible connections with $q$-Gaussians, the
distributions which optimise, under appropriate constraints, the nonadditive
entropy $S_q$, basis of nonextensive statistics mechanics. We have here a
closer look on this model, and numerically obtain probability distributions
which exhibit a slight asymmetry for some parameter values, in variance with
simple $q$-Gaussians. Nevertheless, along many decades, the fitting with
$q$-Gaussians turns out to be numerically very satisfactory for wide regions of
the parameter values, and we illustrate how the index $q$ evolves with $(N,
\tau, \epsilon, \sigma_{max})$. It is nevertheless instructive on how careful
one must be in such numerical analysis. The overall work shows that physical

central issues of sampling theory. In a survey of a population often the
constraints for precision of estimators of subpopulations parameters have to be
taken care of during the allocation of the sample. Such issues are often solved
with mathematical programming procedures. In many situations it is desirable to
allocate the sample, in a way which forces the precision of estimates at the
subpopulations level to be both: optimal and identical, while the constraints
of the total (expected) size of the sample (or samples, in two-stage sampling)
are imposed. Here our main concern is related to two-stage sampling schemes. We
show that such problem in a wide class of sampling plans has an elegant
mathematical and computational solution. This is done due to a suitable
definition of the optimization problem, which enables to solve it through a
linear algebra setting involving eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices
defined in terms of some population quantities. As a final result we obtain a
very simple and relatively universal method for calculating the subpopulation
optimal and equal-precision allocation which is based on one of the most
standard algorithms of linear algebra (available e.g. in R software).
Theoretical solutions are illustrated through a numerical example based on the
Labour Force Survey. Finally, we would like to stress that the method we
describe, allows to accommodate quite automatically for different levels of
precision priority for subpopulations.

from these results that any operad in simplicial sets $\mathsf{P}$ which

rational cohomology (and an analogue of our extra involution requirement in the

average of the estimates obtained using local information. The convergence rate
and the robustness to measurement noise of the proposed observer's output are
characterized in terms of $\mathcal{KL}$ bounds. Several optimization problems
are formulated to design the proposed observer so as to satisfy a given rate of

interconnected observers relax the well-known tradeoff between rate of
convergence and noise amplification, which is a property attributed to the
proposed innovation term that, over the graph, couples the estimates between
the individual observers. Sufficient conditions involving information of the
plant only, assuring that the estimate obtained at each node of the graph

Eu anomalies in ordinary and enstatite chondrites show more scatter in more

the nugget effect associated with concentration of REEs in minor phosphate

  Terrestrial rocks and samples from ordinary and enstatite chondrites display
negative Tm anomalies of ~-4.5 % relative to ca chondrites. In contrast, CM, CO

shows large excess Tm (~+10 %). These anomalies are similar to those found in

either (i) the material in the inner part of the solar system was formed from a

anomalies or (ii) CI chondrites are enriched in refractory dust and are not

able to efficiently compete with intrinsic short-range dynamics of an atomic

spatial profile of a global measurement at a microscopic scale comparable to
the lattice period without the need of single site addressing. In coherence
with a general physical concept, where new competitions typically lead to new
phenomena, we demonstrate novel nontrivial dynamical effects such as
large-scale multimode oscillations, long-range entanglement and correlated
tunneling, as well as selective suppression and enhancement of dynamical
processes beyond the projective limit of the quantum Zeno effect. We
demonstrate both the break-up and protection of strongly interacting fermion

the design of many-body entangled environments for open systems.

Accuracy of the model was confirmed by comparisons with benchmark results and

predict the transverse and longitudinal effective thermal conductivities of
three-dimensional (3D) four-directional braided composites. Some corresponding
experiments based on the Hot Disk method were conducted to measure their
transverse and longitudinal effective thermal conductivities. The predicted
data fit the experiment data well. Influences of fiber volume fractions and
interior braiding angles on the effective thermal conductivities of 3D
four-directional braided composites were then studied. The results show that a
larger fiber volume fraction leads to a larger effective thermal conductivity
along the transverse and longitudinal directions; a larger interior braiding
angle brings a larger transverse thermal conductivity but a smaller one along
the longitudinal direction. It is also shown that for anisotropic materials the
periodic boundary condition is different from the adiabatic boundary condition

interacting, with the rotating disk of gas and dust revealed by ALMA distinctly
offset from the near-infrared emission. The clumpy nature of the dust and a low
value of the Toomre parameter of Q=0.3 suggest that the disk is in a state of
collapse. We estimate a star formation rate in the disk of 470+/-80 M_sol/yr

and I show that the thermodynamics and conserved quantities verify the first
law of thermodynamics. I also introduce the thermodynamics of asymptotically
AdS rotating black branes with flat horizon of these class of solutions and I
calculate the finite action by use of the counterterm method inspired by

in the radio emission from the compact source at the centre of our Galaxy,
Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$). If detected, this shadow would provide the first
direct evidence of the existence of black holes and that Sgr A$^*$ is a
supermassive black hole. In addition, the shape of the shadow could be used to
learn about extreme gravity near the event horizon and to determine which
theory of gravity better describes the observations. The mathematical
description of the shadow has so far used a number of simplifying assumptions
that are unlikely to be met by the real observational data. We here provide a
general formalism to describe the shadow as an arbitrary polar curve expressed
in terms of a Legendre expansion. Our formalism does not presume any knowledge
of the properties of the shadow, e.g. the location of its centre, and offers a
number of routes to characterize the distortions of the curve with respect to
reference circles. These distortions can be implemented in a coordinate
independent manner by different teams analysing the same data. We show that the
new formalism provides an accurate and robust description of noisy
observational data, with smaller error variances when compared to previous
approaches for the measurement of the distortion.

analyzed and found to exhibit correlated fluctuations with a self-similar
structure, a signature of large-scale correlations in atmospheric turbulence.
The statistical structure of temporal correlations for fluctuations in
generated and forecast time series was used to quantify two types of forecast
error: a timescale error ($e_{\tau}$) that quantifies the deviations between
the high frequency components of the forecast and the generated time series,
and a scaling error ($e_{\zeta}$) that quantifies the degree to which the
models fail to predict temporal correlations in the fluctuations of the
generated power. With no $a$ $priori$ knowledge of the forecast models, we
suggest a simple memory kernel that reduces both the timescale error
($e_{\tau}$) and the scaling error ($e_{\zeta}$).

better understanding fundamental interactions. In this paper a six-dimensional
Kaluza-Klein type model at the classical, Einstein's gravity formulation is
considered. The static spherically symmetric solution of the six-dimensional
Einstein equations coupled to the Klein-Gordon equation with the massless
dilatonic field is presented. As it is horizon free, it is fundamentally
different from the four-dimensional Schwarzschild solution. The motion of test
particles in such a spherically symmetric configuration is then analyzed. The
presence of the dilatonic field has a similar dynamical effect as the existence
of additional massive matter. The emphasis is put on some observable quantities
like redshifts. It has been suggested that strange features of emission lines
from galactic nuclei as well as quasar-galaxy associations may in fact be
manifestations of the multidimensionality of the world.
