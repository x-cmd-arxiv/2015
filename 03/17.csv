  filtering","To appear in the proceedings of IEEE Conference on Decision and

accuracy is established on the Special Orthogonal group $SO(3)$. It is
intrinsic in the sense that it does not rely on a specific choice of
coordinates on $SO(3)$: the result is derived using rotation matrices, but
remains valid when using other parameterizations, such as quaternions. For any
estimator $\hat R$ of $R\in SO(3)$ we give indeed a lower bound on the quantity
$E(\log(R\hat R^T))$, that is, the estimation error expressed in terms of group
multiplication, whereas the usual estimation error $E(\hat R-R)$ is meaningless
on $SO(3)$. The result is first applied to Whaba's problem. Then, we consider
the problem of a continuous-time nonlinear deterministic system on $SO(3)$ with
discrete measurements subject to additive isotropic Gaussian noise, and we
derive a lower bound to the estimation error covariance matrix. We prove the
intrinsic Cram\'er-Rao bound coincides with the covariance matrix returned by
the Invariant EKF, and thus can be computed online. This is in sharp contrast
with the general case, where the bound can only be computed if the true
trajectory of the system is known.

the presence of suspended non-Brownian macroscopic particles decreased the
dispersivity of a passive solute, for a pressure-driven flow in a narrow
parallel-plates channel at low Reynolds number. This result contradicts the
idea that the streamline distortion caused by the random diffusive motion of
the particles increases the dispersion and mixing of the solute. Therefore, to
estimate the influence of this motion on the dispersivity of the solute, and
investigate the origin of the reported decrease, we experimentally studied the
probability density functions (pdf) of the particle velocities, and
spatio-temporal correlations, in the same experimental configuration. We
observed that, as the mean suspension velocity exceeds a critical value, the
pdf of the streamwise velocities of the particles markedly changes from a
symmetric distribution to an asymmetric one strongly skewed to high velocities
and with a peak of most probable velocity close to the maximum velocity. The
latter observations and the analysis of suspension microstructure indicate that
the observed decrease in the dispersivity of the solute is due to particle
migration to the mid-plane of the channel, and consequent flattening of the
velocity profile. Moreover, we estimated the contribution of particle diffusive
motion to the solute dispersivity to be three orders of magnitude smaller than
the reported decrease, and thus negligible. Solute dispersion is then much more
affected by how particles modify the flow velocity profile across the channel,
than by their diffusive random motion.

challenge in quantum metrology science and quantum photonics research. The
transverse spatial state of a photon is a convenient high-dimensional quantum
system for study, as it has a well-understood classical analogue as the
transverse complex field profile of an optical beam. One severe drawback of all
currently available quantum metrology techniques is the need for a
time-consuming characterization process, which scales very unfavorably with the
dimensionality of the quantum system. Here we demonstrate a technique that
directly measures a million-dimensional photonic spatial state in a single
setting. Through the arrangement of a weak measurement of momentum and parallel
strong measurements of position, the complex values of the entire photon state
vector become measurable directly. The dimension of our measured state is
approximately four orders of magnitude larger than previously measured. Our
work opens up a practical route for characterizing high-dimensional quantum
systems in real time. Furthermore, our demonstration also serve as a
high-speed, extremely-high-resolution unambiguous complex field measurement
technique for diverse classical applications.

small and large spheres represent the solvent and the solute, respectively, is
introduced. The solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions are of
hard-sphere type, while the solute-solvent interactions are of
sticky-hard-sphere type with tunable degrees of size nonadditivity and
stickiness. Two particular and complementary limits are studied using
analytical and semi-analytical tools. The first case is characterized by zero
nonadditivity, lending itself to a Percus-Yevick approximate solution from
which the impact of stickiness on the spinodal curves and on the effective
solute-solute potential is analyzed. In the opposite nonadditive case, the
solvent-solvent diameter is zero and the model can then be reckoned as an
extension of the well-known Asakura-Oosawa model with additional sticky
solute-solvent interaction. This latter model has the property that its exact
effective one-component problem involves only solute-solute pair potentials for
size ratios such that a solvent particle fits inside the interstitial region of
three touching solutes. In particular, we explicitly identify the three
competing physical mechanisms (depletion, pulling, and bridging) giving rise to
the effective interaction. Some remarks on the phase diagram of these two
complementary models are also addressed through the use of the Noro-Frenkel
criterion and a first-order perturbation analysis. Our findings suggest
reentrance of the fluid-fluid instability as solvent density (in the first

of the interpretation of recent experimental studies of microgels adsorbed onto

that water rather than methane is the dominant opacity source in the red half
of the J-band of the T8 dwarf. Water appears to be the main absorber in this

many forensic methods have been proposed to identify image forgeries, most of
them are targeted ones, since their proposed features are highly dependent on
the image operation under investigation. The performance of the well-designed
features for detecting the targeted operation usually degrades significantly
for other operations. On the other hand, a wise attacker can perform
anti-forensics to fool the existing forensic methods, making countering
anti-forensics become an urgent need. In this paper, we try to find a universal
feature to detect various image processing and anti-forensic operations. Based
on our extensive experiments and analysis, we find that any image
processing/anti-forensic operations would inevitably modify many image pixels.
This would change some inherent statistics within original images, which is
similar to the case of steganography. Therefore, we model image
processing/anti-forensic operations as steganography problems, and propose a
detection strategy by applying steganalytic features. With some advanced
steganalytic features, we are able to detect various image operations and
further identify their types. In our experiments, we have tested several
steganalytic features on 11 different kinds of typical image processing
operations and 4 kinds of anti-forensic operations. The experimental results
have shown that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms the existing
forensic methods in both effectiveness and universality.

occupation of the open metal sites is governed by kinetics, whereby the

reaction barrier for molecular exchange. Specifically, the displacement of CO2
adsorbed at the metal center by other molecules such as H2O, NH3, SO2, NO, NO2,
N2, O2, and CH4 is mainly observed for H2O and NH3, even though SO2, NO, and
NO2, have higher binding energies (~70-90 kJ/mol) to metal sites than that of
CO2 (38 to 48 kJ/mol) and slightly higher than water (~60-80 kJ/mol). DFT
simulations evaluate the barriers for H2O->CO2 and SO2->CO2 exchange to be - 13

barrier for this exchange is determined by the specifics of the interaction of
the second guest molecule (e.g., H2O or SO2) with the MOF ligands.

a magnetic field of $\approx 10^{12}$ G. The Westfold and Legg model predict a
circular polarization which is proportional to the square root of the magnetic
field, and consequently predicts greater than 100 per cent circular
polarization at high magnetic fields. Here a new model is derived based upon a
more detailed analysis of the pitch angle distribution. This model is concerned
with the frequency range $f_{B_0}/\gamma <<f\lesssim f_{B_0}$, noting that
$f_{B_0} = 2.7\times10^7B$, which for a relatively high magnetic field ($\sim

This trend is propelled especially by the proliferation of mobile devices with

verification is increasingly applied for authenticating financial transactions.
In this study we describe a novel attack vector against fingerprint
verification systems which we coin skilled impostor attack. We show that
existing protocols for performance evaluation of fingerprint verification
systems are flawed and as a consequence of this, the system's real
vulnerability is systematically underestimated. We examine a scenario in which
a fingerprint verification system is tuned to operate at false acceptance rate
of 0.1% using the traditional verification protocols with random impostors
(zero-effort attacks). We demonstrate that an active and intelligent attacker
can achieve a chance of success in the area of 89% or more against this system
by performing skilled impostor attacks. We describe a new protocol for
evaluating fingerprint verification performance in order to improve the
assessment of potential and limitations of fingerprint recognition systems.
This new evaluation protocol enables a more informed decision concerning the
operating threshold in practical applications and the respective trade-off
between security (low false acceptance rates) and usability (low false
rejection rates). The skilled impostor attack is a general attack concept which
is independent of specific databases or comparison algorithms. The proposed
protocol relying on skilled impostor attacks can directly be applied for
evaluating the verification performance of other biometric modalities such as
e.g. iris, face, ear, finger vein, gait or speaker recognition.

dyanamical processes is a crucial task in quantum information theory. To this
aim, an appopriate formalism is provided by the decoherent histories framework.
While this approach has been deeply explored from different theoretical
perspectives, it still lacks of a comprehensive set of tools able to concisely
quantify the amount of coherence developed by a given dynamics. In this paper
we introduce and test different measures of the (average) coherence present in
dissipative (Markovian) quantum evolutions, at various time scales and for
different levels of environmentally induced decoherence. In order to show the
effectiveness of the introduced tools, we apply them to a paradigmatic quantum
process where the role of coherence is being hotly debated: exciton transport
in photosynthetic complexes. To spot out the essential features that may
determine the performance of the transport we focus on a relevant trimeric
subunit of the FMO complex and we use a simplified (Haken-Strobl) model for the
system-bath interaction. Our analysis illustrates how the high efficiency of
environmentally assisted transport can be traced back to a quantum recoil
avoiding effect on the exciton dynamics, that preserves and sustains the
benefits of the initial fast quantum delocalization of the exciton over the
network. Indeed, for intermediate levels of decoherence, the bath is seen to
selectively kill the negative interference between different exciton pathways,
while retaining the initial positive one. The concepts and tools here developed
show how the decoherent histories approach can be used to quantify the relation
between coherence and efficiency in quantum dynamical processes.

stationary shock waves with magnetostatic turbulence is generalized to
arbitrary shock speeds $V_s=\beta_1c$, including in particular relativistic
speeds. This is achieved by applying the diffusion approximation to the
relevant Fokker-Planck particle transport equation formulated in the mixed
comoving coordinate system. In this coordinate system the particle's momentum
coordinates $p$ and $\mu =p_{\parallel }/p$ are taken in the rest frame of the
streaming plasma, whereas the time and space coordinates are taken in the
observer's system. For magnetostatic slab turbulence the diffusion-convection
transport equation for the isotropic (in the rest frame of the streaming
plasma) part of the particle's phase space density is derived. For a step-wise
shock velocity profile the steady-state diffusion-convection transport equation
is solved. For a symmetric pitch-angle scattering Fokker-Planck coefficient
$D_{\mu \mu }(-\mu )=D_{\mu \mu }(\mu )$ the steady-state solution is
independent of the microphysical scattering details. For nonrelativistic
mono-momentum particle injection at the shock the differential number density
of accelerated particles is a Lorentzian-type distribution function which at
large momenta approaches a power law distribution function $N(p\ge p_c)\propto
p^{-\xi }$ with the spectral index $\xi (\beta_1)
=1+[3/(\Gamma_1\sqrt{r^2-\beta_1^2}-1)(1+3\beta_1^2)]$. For nonrelativistic
($\beta_1\ll 1$) shock speeds this spectral index agrees with the known result
$\xi (\beta_1\ll 1)\simeq (r+2)/(r-1)$, whereas for ultrarelativistic

galactic nuclei (AGN) in a sample of giant low surface brightness (GLSB)
galaxies. GLSB galaxies are extreme late type spirals that are large, isolated
and poorly evolved compared to regular spiral galaxies. Earlier studies have
indicated that their nuclei have relatively low mass black holes. Using data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we selected a sample of 30 GLSB
galaxies that showed broad H$\alpha$ emission lines in their AGN spectra. In
some galaxies such as UGC 6284, the broad component of H$\alpha$ is more
related to outflows rather than the black hole. One galaxy (UGC 6614) showed
two broad components in H$\alpha$, one associated with the black hole and the
other associated with an outflow event. We derived the nuclear black hole (BH)
masses of 29 galaxies from their broad H$\alpha$ parameters. We find that the
nuclear BH masses lie in the range $10^{5}-10^{7} M_{\odot}$. The bulge stellar
velocity dispersion $\sigma_{e}$ was determined from the underlying stellar
spectra. We compared our results with the existing BH mass - velocity
dispersion ($M_{BH}-\sigma_{e}$) correlations and found that the majority of
our sample lie in the low BH mass regime and below the $M_{BH}-\sigma_{e}$
correlation. The effects of galaxy orientation in the measurement of $\sigma_e$
and the increase of $\sigma_e$ due to the effects of bar are probable reasons
for the observed offset for some galaxies, but in many galaxies the offset is
real. A possible explanation for the $M_{BH}-\sigma_{e}$ offset could be lack
of mergers and accretion events in the history of these galaxies which leads to
a lack of BH-bulge co-evolution. \keywords{galaxies: active, galaxies: bulges,

the end of their lives in a phase known as the asymptotic giant branch (AGB).
During the AGB a significant fraction of their initial mass is expelled in a
stellar wind. This process controls the final stages of their evolution and
contributes to the chemical evolution of galaxies. However, the wind-driving
mechanism of AGB stars is not yet well understood, especially so for
oxygen-rich sources. Characterizing both the present-day mass-loss and wind
structure and the evolution of the mass-loss rate of such stars is paramount to
advancing our understanding of this processes. We modelled the dust envelope of
W Hya using an advanced radiative transfer code. The dust model was analysed in
the light of a previously calculated gas-phase wind model and compared to
measurements available in the literature, such as infrared spectra, infrared
images, and optical scattered light fractions. We find that the dust spectrum
of W Hya can partly be explained by a gravitationally bound dust shell that
probably is responsible for most of the amorphous Al$_2$O$_3$ emission. The
composition of the large ($\sim$\,0.3\,$\mu$m) grains needed to explain the
scattered light cannot be constrained, but probably is dominated by silicates.
Silicate emission in the thermal infrared was found to originate from beyond 40
AU from the star and we find that they need to have substantial near-infrared
opacities to be visible at such large distances. The increase in near-infrared
opacity of the dust at these distances roughly coincides with a sudden increase
in expansion velocity as deduced from the gas-phase CO lines. Finally, the
recent mass loss of W Hya is confirmed to be highly variable and we identify a
strong peak in the mass-loss rate that occurred about 3500 years ago and lasted
for a few hundred years.

We characterize the topologies of the networks emerging at a Nash equilibrium
(NE) of this game and compare the efficiency of equilibrium networks with the
efficiency of centrally designed networks. To quantify the impact of
information redundancy and linking cost on social information loss, we provide
estimates for the Price of Anarchy (PoA); to quantify the impact on individual

Maximum Information Loss (MIL). Finally, we consider the setting in which

understand the source of the discrepancy by tracing the potential sources of
systematic and statistical error for the inverse-Compton Doppler factors. By
eliminating these sources of error, we provide stronger constrains on the value
of the Doppler factor in blazar jets. We re-estimate the inverse-Compton
Doppler factor for 11 sources that meet certain criteria for their synchrotron
peak frequency and the availability of Doppler factor estimates in the
literature. We compare these estimates with the average of two different
estimates of the variability Doppler factor obtained using various datasets and
methodologies to identify any discrepancies and, in each case, trace their
sources in the methodology or assumptions adopted. We identify three
significant sources of error for the inverse-Compton Doppler factors: a)
contamination of the X-ray flux by non-synchrotron self-Compton emission; b)
radio observations at frequencies other than the synchrotron turnover
frequency; c) non-simultaneity between radio and X-ray observations. We discuss
key aspects in the correct application of the inverse-Compton method in light

mere existence of comets suggest that the physics of cold interstellar gas

  We study the case of a cold gaseous medium in ISM conditions which is subject
to a gas-liquid/solid phase transition.
  First the equilibrium of general non-ideal fluids is studied using the virial
theorem and linear stability analysis. Then the non-linear dynamics is studied
by using simulations to characterize the expected formation of solid bodies
analogous to comets. The simulations are run with a state of the art molecular
dynamics code (LAMMPS). The long-range gravitational forces can be taken into
account with short-range molecular forces with finite limited computational
resources by using super-molecules, provided the right scaling is followed.
  The concept of super-molecule is tested with simulations, allowing us to
correctly satisfy the Jeans instability criterion for one-phase fluids. The
simulations show that fluids presenting a phase transition are gravitationally
unstable as well, independent of the strength of the gravitational potential,
producing two distinct kinds of sub-stellar bodies, those dominated by gravity
(""planetoids"") and those dominated by molecular attractive force (""comets"").
  Observations, formal analysis and computer simulations suggest the
possibility of the formation of substellar H2 clumps in cold molecular clouds
due to the combination of phase transition and gravity. Fluids presenting a
phase transition are gravitationally unstable, independent of the strength of
the gravitational potential. Arbitrarily small H2 clumps may form even at
relatively high temperatures up to 400 - 600K, according to virial analysis.
The combination of phase transition and gravity may be relevant for a wider
range of astrophysical situations, such as proto-planetary disks.

fraction of the gas available at its Bondi radius. The physical processes
determining this accretion rate remain unknown, partly due to a lack of
observational constraints on the gas at distances between ~10 and ~10$^5$
Schwarzschild radii (Rs) from the black hole. Recent infrared observations
identify low-mass gas clouds, G1 and G2, moving on highly eccentric, nearly
co-planar orbits through the accretion flow around Sgr A*. Although it is not
yet clear whether these objects contain embedded stars, their extended gaseous
envelopes evolve independently as gas clouds. In this paper we attempt to use
these gas clouds to constrain the properties of the accretion flow at ~10$^3$
Rs. Assuming that G1 and G2 follow the same trajectory, we model the small
differences in their orbital parameters as evolution resulting from interaction
with the background flow. We find evolution consistent with the G-clouds
originating in the clockwise disk. Our analysis enables the first unique
determination of the rotation axis of the accretion flow: we localize the
rotation axis to within 20 degrees, finding an orientation consistent with the
parsec-scale jet identified in x-ray observations and with the circumnuclear
disk, a massive torus of molecular gas ~1.5 pc from Sgr A*. This suggests that
the gas in the accretion flow comes predominantly from the circumnuclear disk,
rather than the winds of stars in the young clockwise disk. This result will be
tested by the Event Horizon Telescope within the next year. Our model also
makes testable predictions for the orbital evolution of G1 and G2, falsifiable

wave (GW) signal to be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs): will it be an
individual, resolved supermassive black hole binary (SBHB), or a stochastic
background made by the superposition of GWs produced by an ensemble of SBHBs?
To address this issue, we analyse a broad set of simulations of the
cosmological population of SBHBs, that cover the entire parameter space allowed
by current electromagnetic observations in an unbiased way. For each
simulation, we construct the expected GW signal and identify the loudest
individual sources. We then employ appropriate detection statistics to evaluate
the relative probability of detecting each type of source as a function of time
for a variety of PTAs; we consider the current International PTA, and speculate
into the era of the Square Kilometre Array. The main properties of the first
detectable individual SBHBs are also investigated. Contrary to previous work,
we cast our results in terms of the detection probability (DP), since the
commonly adopted criterion based on a signal-to-noise ratio threshold is
statistic-dependent and may result in misleading conclusions for the statistics
adopted here. Our results confirm quantitatively that a stochastic signal is
more likely to be detected first (with between 75 to 93 per cent probability,
depending on the array), but the DP of single-sources is not negligible. Our
framework is very flexible and can be easily extended to more realistic arrays

depend on the local dust-to-gas ratio and the interstellar radiation field.
Both result in H$_2$ galaxy mass functions that agree well with observations in
the local and high-redshift Universe. The simulations reproduce the observed
scaling relations between the mass of H$_2$ and the stellar mass, star
formation rate and stellar surface density. Towards high edshifts, galaxies in
the simulations display larger H$_2$ mass fractions, and correspondingly lower
H$_2$ depletion timescales, also in good agreement with observations. The
comoving mass density of H$_2$ in units of the critical density, $\Omega_{\rm
H_2}$, peaks at $z\approx 1.2-1.5$, later than the predicted peak of the cosmic
star formation rate activity, at $z\approx 2$. This difference stems from the
decrease in gas metallicity and increase in interstellar radiation field with
redshift, both of which hamper H$_2$ formation. We find that the cosmic H$_2$
budget is dominated by galaxies with $M_{\rm H_2}>10^9\,\rm M_{\odot}$, star
formation rates $>10\,\rm M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$ and stellar masses $M_{\rm

not associated with its ending can produce scalar, and to a lesser extent,
tensor power spectra where deviations from scale-free power law spectra can be
as large as the deviations from scale invariance itself. Here the standard
slow-roll approach breaks down since its parameters evolve on an efolding scale
$\Delta N$ much smaller than the efolds to the end of inflation. Using the
generalized slow-roll approach, we show that the expansion of observables in a
hierarchy of potential or Hubble evolution parameters comes from a Taylor
expansion of the features around an evaluation point that can be optimized.
Optimization of the leading-order expression provides a sufficiently accurate
approximation for current data as long as the power spectrum can be described
over the well-observed few efolds by the local tilt and running. Standard
second-order approaches, often used in the literature, ironically are worse
than leading-order approaches due to inconsistent evaluation of observables. We
develop a new optimized next-order approach which predicts observables to
$10^{-3}$ even for $\Delta N\sim 1$ where all parameters in the infinite
hierarchy are of comparable magnitude. For models with $\Delta N \ll 1$, the
generalized slow-roll approach provides integral expressions that are accurate
to second order in the deviation from scale invariance. Their evaluation in the
monodromy model provides highly accurate explicit relations between the running

significantly detected in a single GAMA fibre. Galaxy pairs identified from
their blended spectrum fall into two principal classes: they are either strong
lenses, a passive galaxy lensing an emission-line galaxy; or occulting
galaxies, serendipitous overlaps of two galaxies, of any type. Blended spectra
can thus be used to reliably identify strong lenses for follow-up observations
(high resolution imaging) and occulting pairs, especially those that are a
late-type partly obscuring an early-type galaxy which are of interest for the
study of dust content of spiral and irregular galaxies. The GAMA survey setup
and its autoz automated redshift determination were used to identify candidate
blended galaxy spectra from the cross-correlation peaks. We identify 280
blended spectra with a minimum velocity separation of 600 km/s, of which 104
are lens pair candidates, 71 emission-line-passive pairs, 78 are pairs of
emission-line galaxies and and 27 are pairs of galaxies with passive spectra.
We have visually inspected the candidates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

ellipticals with blue fuzz (Ef in our classification). These latter ""Ef""
classifications are candidates for possible strong lenses, massive ellipticals
with an emission-line galaxy in one or more lensed images. The GAMA lens and
occulting galaxy candidate samples are similar in size to those identified in
the entire SDSS. This blended spectrum sample stands as a testament of the
power of this highly complete, second-largest spectroscopic survey in existence
and offers the possibility to expand e.g., strong gravitational lens surveys.

$c/a$ increases with halo mass and integrated star formation efficiency,
reaching $\sim 0.8$ at the Milky Way mass (compared to 0.5 in DM-only),

distribution of DM is similar in both DM-only and NIHAO simulations, but in the

distribution is more symmetric, roughly Gaussian, with a peak that shifts to
higher velocities for Milky Way mass haloes. We provide the distribution

$i=49.5\degr\pm3.5\degr$ and $\mathrm{PA}=18.2\degr\pm3.5\degr$ and the dusty
and gaseous disk are detected up to $\sim220$ au and $\sim400$ au from the
star, respectively. Most importantly, our continuum observations indicate that
the cavity size in the mm-sized dust distribution must be $\sim97$ au in
radius, the largest cavity observed around a T Tauri star. Our data clearly
confirms the presence of \co(2-1) well inside the dust cavity. Based on these
observational constrains we developed a disk model that simultaneously accounts
for the \co and continuum observations (i.e., gaseous and dusty disk).
According to our model, most of the millimeter emission comes from a ring
located between 97 and 140 au. We also find that the dust cavity is divided
into an innermost region largely depleted of dust particles ranging from the
dust sublimation radius up to 85 au, and a second, moderately dust-depleted
region, extending from 85 to 97 au. The extremely large size of the dust
cavity, the presence of gas and small dust particles within the cavity and the
accretion rate of Sz\,91 are consistent with the formation of multiple (giant)
planets.

Usually, it is assumed that the initial entangled pairs are i.i.d. distributed

all in any entanglement generation process involving memory channels. Here, we
introduce a framework that captures entanglement distillation in the presence
of natural correlations arising from memory channels. Conceptually, we bring
together ideas from condensed-matter physics - that of renormalisation and of
matrix-product states and operators - with those of local entanglement

Super-Kamiokande has the exposure needed for progress, but detector backgrounds
are a limiting factor. A leading component is the beta decays of isotopes
produced by cosmic-ray muons and their secondaries, which initiate nuclear
spallation reactions. Cuts of events after and surrounding muon tracks reduce
this spallation decay background by $\simeq 90\%$ (at a cost of $\simeq 20\%$
deadtime), but its rate at 6--18 MeV is still dominant. A better way to cut
this background was suggested in a Super-Kamiokande paper [Bays {\it et al.},
Phys.~Rev.~D {\bf 85}, 052007 (2012)] on a search for the diffuse supernova
neutrino background. They found that spallation decays above 16 MeV were
preceded near the same location by a peak in the apparent Cherenkov light
profile from the muon; a more aggressive cut was applied to a limited section
of the muon track, leading to decreased background without increased deadtime.
We put their empirical discovery on a firm theoretical foundation. We show that
almost all spallation decay isotopes are produced by muon-induced showers and
that these showers are rare enough and energetic enough to be identifiable.
This is the first such demonstration for any detector. We detail how the
physics of showers explains the peak in the muon Cherenkov light profile and
other Super-K observations. Our results provide a physical basis for practical
improvements in background rejection that will benefit multiple studies. For
solar neutrinos, in particular, it should be possible to dramatically reduce
backgrounds at energies as low as 6 MeV.

photoionization coefficient has to be evaluated using the radiation temperature

after changing this aspect. Using Planck 2013 data and considering only the

experiments which are sensitive to the Higgs-electron coupling and derive the
current bounds on new physics contributing to this coupling. The strongest

resonant Higgs production at electron colliders, Higgs mediated B -> e^+ e^-

However, the semantics of SPARQL restricts the scope of navigation via PPs to

To fill this gap, in this paper we provide formal foundations for evaluating
PPs on the Web, thus contributing to the definition of a query language for
Linked Data. In particular, we introduce a query semantics for PPs that couples
navigation at the data level with navigation on the Web graph. Given this

might exist on so-called ""waterworlds"". I map these as a function of solar
constant for planets ranging in size from Mars size to 10 Earth-mass. The
states are: globally ice covered (Ts< 245K), cold and damp (270 < Ts< 290K),
hot and moist (350< Ts< 550K) and very hot and dry (Ts< 900K). No stable
climate exists for 290< Ts < 350K or 550 < Ts < 900K. The union of hot moist
and cold damp climates describe the liquid water habitable zone, the width and
location of which depends on planet mass. At each solar constant, two or three
different climate states are stable. This is a consequence of strong
non-linearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight.
  Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to
high altitudes as they warm. The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth
of unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet
surface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the
former dominates). The atmospheres of small planets expand more due to weaker
gravity: the effective runaway greenhouse threshold is about 35Wm-2 higher for
Mars, 10Wm-2 higher for Earth or Venus but only a few Wm-2 higher for a 10
Earth-mass planet. There is an underlying (expansion neglected) trend of
increasing runaway greenhouse threshold with planetary size (40Wm-2 higher for
a 10 Earth-mass planet than for Mars). Summing these opposing trends means that
Venus-size (or slightly smaller) planets are most susceptible to a runaway
greenhouse.
  The habitable zone for pure water atmospheres is very narrow, with an
insolation range of 0.07 times the solar constant. A wider habitable zone
requires background gas and greenhouse gas; N2 and CO2 on Earth, which are
biologically controlled. Thus, habitability depends on inhabitance.

  Analysis","This paper was merged with another manuscript and is now subsumed by
  arXiv:1511.02513",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adaptivity is an important feature of data analysis---typically the choice of
questions asked about a dataset depends on previous interactions with the same
dataset. However, generalization error is typically bounded in a non-adaptive
model, where all questions are specified before the dataset is drawn. Recent
work by Dwork et al. (STOC '15) and Hardt and Ullman (FOCS '14) initiated the
formal study of this problem, and gave the first upper and lower bounds on the
achievable generalization error for adaptive data analysis.
  Specifically, suppose there is an unknown distribution $\mathcal{P}$ and a
set of $n$ independent samples $x$ is drawn from $\mathcal{P}$. We seek an
algorithm that, given $x$ as input, ""accurately"" answers a sequence of
adaptively chosen ""queries"" about the unknown distribution $\mathcal{P}$. How
many samples $n$ must we draw from the distribution, as a function of the type
of queries, the number of queries, and the desired level of accuracy?
  In this work we make two new contributions towards resolving this question:
  *We give upper bounds on the number of samples $n$ that are needed to answer
statistical queries that improve over the bounds of Dwork et al.
  *We prove the first upper bounds on the number of samples required to answer
more general families of queries. These include arbitrary low-sensitivity
queries and the important class of convex risk minimization queries.
  As in Dwork et al., our algorithms are based on a connection between
differential privacy and generalization error, but we feel that our analysis is
simpler and more modular, which may be useful for studying these questions in
the future.

is dominated by a Compton component peaking between a few hundred keV and a few
hundred MeV. We selected two bright blazars, PKS 2149-306 at redshift z=2.345
and S5 0836+710 at z=2.172, in order to observe them in the hard X-ray band
with the NuSTAR satellite. In this band the Compton component is rapidly rising
almost up to the peak of the emission. Simultaneous soft-X-rays and UV-optical
observations were performed with the Swift satellite, while near-infrared (NIR)
data were obtained with the REM telescope. To study their variability, we
repeated these observations for both sources on a timescale of a few months.
While no fast variability was detected during a single observation, both
sources were found to be variable in the X-ray band, up to 50%, between the two
observations, with larger variability at higher energies. No variability was
detected in the optical/NIR band. These data together with Fermi-LAT, WISE and
other literature data are then used to study the overall spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of these blazars. Although the jet non-thermal emission
dominates the SED, it leaves the UV band unhidden, allowing us to detect the
thermal emission of the disc and to estimate the mass of the black hole. The
non-thermal emission is well reproduced by a one-zone leptonic model. The
non-thermal radiative processes are synchrotron, self-Compton and external
Compton using seed photons from both the broad-line region (BLR) and the torus.
We find that our data are better reproduced if we assume that the location of
the dissipation region of the jet, R_diss, is in-between the torus, (at
R_torus), and the BLR (R_torus>R_diss>R_BLR). The observed variability is
explained by changing a minimum number of model parameters by a very small
amount.

and hyper-connectivity in brains of individuals having autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Here we studied abnormalities in functional brain subnetworks in
high-functioning individuals with ASD during free viewing of a movie containing
social cues and interactions. Methods: Thirteen subjects with ASD and 13
matched-pair controls watched a 68 minutes movie during functional magnetic
resonance imaging. For each subject, we computed Pearson`s correlation between
haemodynamic time-courses of each pair of 6-mm isotropic voxels. From the
whole-brain functional networks, we derived individual and group-level
subnetworks using graph theory. Scaled inclusivity was then calculated between
all subject pairs to estimate intersubject similarity of connectivity structure
of each subnetwork. Additional 27 individuals with ASD from the ABIDE
resting-state database were included to test the reproducibility of the
results. Results: Between-group differences were observed in the composition of
default-mode and a ventro-temporal-limbic (VTL) subnetwork. The VTL subnetwork
included amygdala, striatum, thalamus, parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior
temporal gyri. Further, VTL subnetwork similarity between subject pairs
correlated significantly with similarity of symptom gravity measured with
autism quotient. This correlation was observed also within the controls, and in
the reproducibility dataset with ADI-R and ADOS scores. Conclusions:
Reorganization of functional subnetworks in individuals with ASD clarifies the
mixture of hypo- and hyper-connectivity findings. Importantly, only the
functional organization of the VTL subnetwork emerges as a marker of
inter-individual similarities that co-vary with behavioral measures across all
participants. These findings suggest a pivotal role of ventro-temporal and
limbic systems in autism.

application, namely the impact that this has on non-thermal big bang
nucleosynthesis constraints from 4He, 3He and 2H, using the parametric example
of monochromatic photon injection of different energies. Typically, we find
tighter bounds than those existing in the literature, up to more than one order
of magnitude. As a consequence of the non-universality of the spectrum, the
energy-dependence of the photodissociation cross-sections is important. We also
compare the constraints obtained with current level and future reach of cosmic
microwave background spectral distortion bounds.

function in a small neighborhood of a state that travels within a compact set.
The development is based on the theory of universal reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces over the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. Several theorems are
introduced that support the development of this State Following (StaF) method.
In particular, it is shown that there is a bound on the number of kernel
functions required for the maintenance of an accurate function approximation as
a state moves through a compact set. Additionally, a weight update law, based
on gradient descent, is introduced where arbitrarily close accuracy can be
achieved provided the weight update law is iterated at a sufficient frequency,
as detailed in Theorem 6.1.
  To illustrate the advantage, the impact of the StaF method is that for some
applications the number of basis functions can be reduced. The StaF method is
applied to an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) application to demonstrate
that stability is maintained with a reduced number of basis functions.
  Simulation results demonstrate the utility of the StaF methodology for the
maintenance of accurate function approximation as well as solving an infinite
horizon optimal regulation problem through ADP. The results of the simulation
indicate that fewer basis functions are required to guarantee stability and
approximate optimality than are required when a global approximation approach
is used.

vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the

We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background
and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic
scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation

intrinsic to the source, do allow a very hard primary spectrum, but fail to
explain a regular redshift dependence of the anomaly starting energy. The model
that includes a contribution from secondary photons produced by cosmic rays

achieve. Finally, the model with secondary photons produced in electromagnetic
(EM) cascades initiated by primary gamma-rays is considered. In principle, it
allows to decrease the statistical significance of the anomaly and, while
requiring quite low EGMF strength B, does not contradict to most contemporary
constraints on the B value. Additionally, it is shown that the recently
observed correlation between directions to hard gamma-ray sources and voids in
the Large Scale Structure is a natural feature of the EM cascade model.

a situation where non-additivity is very manifest since the plates lead to the
exponentially suppression of the interaction of the atoms, provided the atoms
are separated by a distance of the order of the distance between the plates or

equilibrium [Phys. Rev. A 80, 012322 (2009)]. Here, we extend this bound to a
large class of feedback-driven quantum engines operating periodically and in
finite time. The bound thus implies a natural definition for the efficiency of
information to work conversion in such devices. For a simple model consisting
of a laser-driven two-level system, we maximize the efficiency with respect to
the observable whose measurement is used to control the feedback operations. We
find that the optimal observable typically does not commute with the

star forming galaxy at redshift $z=0.312$, robustly characterized thanks to
repeated late-time photometric and spectroscopic observations. By taking
difference-photometry of the well sampled multi-year SDSS Stripe-82
light-curve, we are able to probe the evolution of the nuclear spectrum over
the course of the outburst. The tidal disruption event (TDE) interpretation is
consistent with the very rapid rise and the decay time of the flare, which
displays an evolution consistent with the well-known $t^{-5/3}$ behaviour (with
a clear superimposed re-brightening flare). Our analysis places constraints on
the physical properties of the TDE, such as the putative disrupted star's mass
and orbital parameters, as well as the size and temperature of the emitting
material. The properties of the broad and narrow emission lines observed in two
epochs of SDSS spectra provide further constraints on the circum-nuclear
structure, and could be indicative that the system hosted a moderate-luminosity
AGN as recently as a few $10^4$ years ago, and is likely undergoing residual
accretion as late as ten years after peak, as seen from the broad H$\alpha$
emission line. We discuss the complex interplay between tidal disruption events
and gas accretion episodes in galactic nuclei, highlighting the implications
for future TDE searches and for estimates of their intrinsic rates.

an important challenge for computational methods. Doubly occupied configuration
interaction (DOCI), in which all electrons are paired and no correlations which
break these pairs are permitted, can in many cases provide an accurate account
of strong correlations, albeit at combinatorial computational cost. Recently,
there has been significant interest in a method we refer to as pair coupled
cluster doubles (pCCD), a variant of coupled cluster doubles in which the
electrons are paired. This is simply because pCCD provides energies nearly
identical to those of DOCI, but at mean-field computational cost (disregarding
the cost of the two-electron integral transformation). Here, we introduce the
more complete pair extended coupled cluster doubles (pECCD) approach which,
like pCCD, has mean-field cost and reproduces DOCI energetically. We show that
unlike pCCD, pECCD also reproduces the DOCI wave function with high accuracy.
Moreoever, pECCD yields sensible albeit inexact results even for attractive
interactions where pCCD breaks down.

considerably differs from LQG as well as from formulations that bound the

state-feedback control in the two cases where i) steering of the state
distribution is to take place over a finite window of time with minimum energy,
and ii) the goal is to maintain the state at a stationary distribution over an
infinite horizon with minimum power. For both problems the distribution of
noise and state are Gaussian. In the first case, we show that provided the
system is controllable, the state can be steered to any terminal Gaussian
distribution over any specified finite time-interval. In the second case, we
characterize explicitly the covariance of admissible stationary state
distributions that can be maintained with constant state-feedback control. The
conditions for optimality are expressed in terms of a system of dynamically
coupled Riccati equations in the finite horizon case and in terms of algebraic
conditions for the stationary case. In the case where the noise and control

approximation to the product of Toeplitz matrix exponential with a vector. In
this approach, one has to solve two large scale Toeplitz linear systems in
advance. However, if the desired accuracy is high, the cost will be
prohibitive. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how to solve the
Toeplitz systems inexactly in this method. The contribution of this paper is in
three regards. First, we give a new stability analysis on the Gohberg-Semencul
formula (GSF) and define the GSF condition number of a Toeplitz matrix. It is
shown that, when the size of the Toeplitz matrix is large, our result is
sharper than the one given in [M. Gutknecht and M. Hochbruck. {\it The
stability of inversion formulas for Toeplitz matrices}, Linear Algebra Appl.,

Toeplitz systems and the residual of Toeplitz matrix exponential. We show that
if the GSF condition number of the Toeplitz matrix is medium sized, then the
Toeplitz systems can be solved in a low accuracy. Third, based on this
relationship, we present a practical stopping criterion for relaxing the
accuracy of the Toeplitz systems, and propose an inexact shift-and-invert
Arnoldi algorithm for the Toeplitz matrix exponential problem. Numerical
experiments illustrate the numerical behavior of the new algorithm, and show

information encoded in galaxy clustering becomes inaccessible to the usual
power spectrum. ""Sufficient statistics"", A*, were introduced recently to
recapture the lost, and ultimately extract all, cosmological information. We
present analytical approximations for the A* and traditional power spectra as
well as for their covariance matrices in order to calculate analytically their
cosmological information content in the context of Fisher information theory.
Our approach allows the precise quantitative comparison of the techniques with
each other and to the total information in the data, and provides insights into
sufficient statistics. In particular, we find that while the A* power spectrum
has a similar shape to the usual galaxy power spectrum, its amplitude is
strongly modulated by small scale statistics. This effect is mostly responsible
for the ability of the A* power spectrum to recapture the information lost for
the usual power spectrum. We use our framework to forecast the best achievable
cosmological constraints for projected surveys as a function of their galaxy
density, and compare the information content of the two power spectra. We find
that sufficient statistics extract all cosmological information, resulting in
an approximately factor of ~2 gain for dense projected surveys at low redshift.
This increase in the effective volume of projected surveys is consistent with
previous numerical calculations.

spherical lens-shaped nucleus is nucleated on top of a spherical substrate and
on the bottom of the wall of a spherical cavity. The effect of line tension on
the nucleation barrier can be separated from the usual volume term. As the
radius of the substrate increases, the nucleation barrier decreases and
approaches that of a flat substrate. However, as the radius of the cavity
increases, the nucleation barrier increases and approaches that of a flat
substrate. A small spherical substrate is a less active nucleation site than a
flat substrate, and a small spherical cavity is a more active nucleation site
than a flat substrate. In contrast, the line-tension effect on the nucleation
barrier is maximum when the radii of the nucleus and the substrate or cavity
become comparable. Therefore, by tuning the size of the spherical substrate or
spherical cavity, the effect of the line tension can be optimized. These
results will be useful in broad range of applications from material processing
to understanding of global climate, where the heterogeneous nucleation plays a
vital role.

the magnetic flux is largely removed by magnetic diffusion in the first core

large, $\beta>10^4$. Thus, proper treatment of first core phase is crucial in
investigating the formation of protostar and disc. On the other hand, in an
ideal simulation, $\beta\sim 10$ at the centre of the first core. The
simulations with magnetic diffusion show that the circumstellar disc forms at
almost the same time of protostar formation even with a relatively strong
initial magnetic field (the value for the initial mass-to-flux ratio of the
cloud core relative to the critical value is $\mu=4$). The disc has a radius of
$r \sim 1$ AU at the protostar formation epoch. We confirm that the disc is

disappears at the hole concentration of ~0.28 per Cu which coincides with the

formal, denotational semantics of the layered architecture style. Mainly, we
present a sufficiently abstract and rigorous description of layered

of layers, in which services communicate via ports. A layer is modeled as a
relation between used and provided services, and layer composition is defined
by means of relational composition. Furthermore, we provide a formal definition
for the notions of syntactic and semantic dependency between the layers. We
show that these dependencies are not comparable in general. Moreover, we
identify sufficient conditions under which, in an intuitive sense which we make
precise in our treatment, the semantic dependency implies, is implied by, or

domain entails uncertainty, impreciseness, and vagueness, the appliance of such

of this work is twofold: i) we introduce a specification technique based on
fuzzy logic which can be used on top of Focus to develop formal specifications
in a qualitative fashion; ii) we partially extend Focus theory to a fuzzy one
which allows the specification of fuzzy components and fuzzy interactions.
While the former provides a methodology for approximating I/O behaviors under

development of countless innovative applications. However, in reality, it is
easier for us to observe the timestamps when different nodes in the network
react on a message, while the connections empowering the diffusion of the
message remain hidden. This motivates recent extensive studies on the network
inference problem: unveiling the edges from the records of messages
disseminated through them. Existing solutions are computationally expensive,
which motivates us to develop an efficient two-step general framework,
Clustering Embedded Network Inference (CENI). CENI integrates clustering
strategies to improve the efficiency of network inference. By clustering nodes
directly on the timelines of messages, we propose two naive implementations of
CENI: Infection-centric CENI and Cascade-centric CENI. Additionally, we point
out the critical dimension problem of CENI: instead of one-dimensional
timelines, we need to first project the nodes to an Euclidean space of certain
dimension before clustering. A CENI adopting clustering method on the projected
space can better preserve the structure hidden in the cascades, and generate
more accurately inferred links. This insight sheds light on other related work
attempting to discover or utilize the latent cluster structure in the
disseminated messages. By addressing the critical dimension problem, we propose
the third implementation of the CENI framework: Projection-based CENI. Through
extensive experiments on two real datasets, we show that the three CENI models
only need around 20% $\sim$ 50% of the running time of state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, the inferred edges of Projection-based CENI preserves or
even outperforms the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods.

feature of cyber-physical systems. Hence, the functional correctness of a
cyber- physical system is crucially dependent not only on the dynamics of the
analog physical environment, but also on the decisions taken by the discrete
control that alter the dynamics of the environment. The framework of Hybrid
automata---introduced by Alur, Courcoubetis, Henzinger, and Ho---provides a
formal modeling and specification environment to analyze the interaction
between the discrete and continuous parts of a cyber-physical system. Hybrid
automata can be considered as generalizations of finite state automata
augmented with a finite set of real-valued variables whose dynamics in each
state is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Moreover, the
discrete transitions of hybrid automata are guarded by constraints over the
values of these real-valued variables, and enable discontinuous jumps in the
evolution of these variables. Considering the richness of the dynamics in a
hybrid automaton, it is perhaps not surprising that the fundamental
verification questions, like reachability and schedulability, for the general
model are undecidable. In this article we present a review of hybrid automata
as modeling and verification framework for cyber-physical systems, and survey
some of the key results related to practical verification questions related to

energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We study the possibility that the PeV neutrinos
recently observed by IceCube are produced by GRB cosmic rays interacting with
the interstellar gas in the host galaxies. By studying the relation between the
X-ray absorption column density N_H and the surface star-formation rate of GRB
host galaxies, we find that N_H is a good indicator of the surface gas density
of the host galaxies. Then we are able to calculate the neutrino production
efficiency of CRs for GRBs with known N_H. We collect a sample of GRBs that
have both measurements of N_H and accurate gamma-ray fluence, and attempt to
calculate the accumulated neutrino flux based on the current knowledge about
GRBs and their host galaxies. When the CR intensity produced by GRBs is
normalized with the observed UHECR flux above $10^{19}{\rm eV}$, the
accumulated neutrino flux at PeV energies is estimated to be about
$(0.3\pm0.2)\times10^{-8} \rm{GeV\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\ sr^{-1}} $ (per flavor)
under the assumption that GRB energy production rate follows the cosmic
star-formation rate and the favorable assumption about the CR diffusion
coefficient. This flux is insufficient to account for the IceCube observations,
but the estimate suffers from some assumptions in the calculation and thus we
can not rule out this scenario at present.

  artificial agents","11 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.AI cs.NE cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A system with artificial intelligence usually relies on symbol manipulation,
at least partly and implicitly. However, the interpretation of the symbols -
what they represent and what they are about - is ultimately left to humans, as
designers and users of the system. How symbols can acquire meaning for the
system itself, independent of external interpretation, is an unsolved problem.
Some grounding of symbols can be obtained by embodiment, that is, by causally
connecting symbols (or sub-symbolic variables) to the physical environment,
such as in a robot with sensors and effectors. However, a causal connection as
such does not produce representation and aboutness of the kind that symbols
have for humans. Here I present a theory that explains how humans and other
living organisms have acquired the capability to have symbols and sub-symbolic
variables that represent, refer to, and are about something else. The theory
shows how reference can be to physical objects, but also to abstract objects,
and even how it can be misguided (errors in reference) or be about non-existing
objects. I subsequently abstract the primary components of the theory from
their biological context, and discuss how and under what conditions the theory
could be implemented in artificial agents. A major component of the theory is
the strong nonlinearity associated with (potentially unlimited)
self-reproduction. The latter is likely not acceptable in artificial systems.
It remains unclear if goals other than those inherently serving
self-reproduction can have aboutness and if such goals could be stabilized.

Each accretion burst is accompanied by a temporary increase in luminosity,
heating up the circumstellar envelope and altering the chemical composition of
the gas and dust. This paper aims to study such chemical effects and discusses
the feasibility of using molecular spectroscopy as a tracer of episodic
accretion rates and timescales.
  Methods: We simulate a strong accretion burst in a diverse sample of 25
spherical envelope models by increasing the luminosity to 100 times the
observed value. Using a comprehensive gas-grain network, we follow the chemical
evolution during the burst and for up to 10^5 yr after the system returns to
quiescence. The resulting abundance profiles are fed into a line radiative
transfer code to simulate rotational spectra of C18O, HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ at
a series of time steps. We compare these spectra to observations taken from the
literature and to previously unpublished data of HCO+ and N2H+ 6-5 from the
Herschel Space Observatory.
  Results: The bursts are strong enough to evaporate CO throughout the
envelope, which in turn enhances the abundance of HCO+ and reduces that of
N2H+. After the burst, it takes 10^3-10^4 yr for CO to refreeze and for HCO+
and N2H+ to return to normal. The chemical effects of the burst remain visible
in the rotational spectra for as long as 10^5 yr after the burst has ended,
highlighting the importance of considering luminosity variations when analyzing
molecular line observations in protostars. The spherical models are currently
not accurate enough to derive robust timescales from single-dish observations.
As follow-up work, we suggest that the models be calibrated against spatially
resolved observations in order to identify the best tracers to be used for
statistically significant source samples.

process execution data recorded in event logs. Conformance checking is a branch
of this discipline embracing approaches for verifying whether the behavior of a
process, as recorded in a log, is in line with some expected behaviors provided
in the form of a process model. The majority of these approaches require the
input process model to be procedural (e.g., a Petri net). However, in turbulent
environments, characterized by high variability, the process behavior is less
stable and predictable. In these environments, procedural process models are
less suitable to describe a business process. Declarative specifications,
working in an open world assumption, allow the modeler to express several
possible execution paths as a compact set of constraints. Any process execution
that does not contradict these constraints is allowed. One of the open
challenges in the context of conformance checking with declarative models is
the capability of supporting multi-perspective specifications. In this paper,
we close this gap by providing a framework for conformance checking based on
MP-Declare, a multi-perspective version of the declarative process modeling
language Declare. The approach has been implemented in the process mining tool

of the supercurrent and the flavour current multiplets. We demonstrate that
supersymmetry imposes additional restrictions on the correlators of conserved
currents as compared with the non-supersymmetric case studied by Osborn and
Petkou in hep-th/9307010. It is shown that the three-point function of the
supercurrent is determined by a single functional form consistent with the
conservation equation and all the symmetry properties. Similarly, the
three-point function of the flavour current multiplets is also determined by a
single functional form in the N=1 and N=3 cases. The specific feature of the
N=2 case is that two independent structures are allowed for the three-point
function of flavour current multiplets, but only one of them contributes to the
three-point function of the conserved currents contained in these multiplets.
Since the supergravity and super-Yang-Mills Ward identities are expected to
relate the coefficients of the two- and three-point functions under

particles represents a relatively simple system to study the effects of the
deviations from spherical symmetry in the mechanism of violent relaxation.
Initial deviations from spherical symmetry are shown to play a dynamical role
that is equivalent to that of density fluctuations in the case of an initially
spherical cloud. Indeed, these deviations control the amount of particles
energy change and thus determine the properties of the final energy
distribution, particularly the appearance of two species of particles: bound
and free. Ejection of mass and energy from the system together with the
formation of a density profile decaying as $\rho(r) \sim r^{-4}$ and a
Keplerian radial velocity dispersion profile, are the prominent features
similar to those observed after the violent relaxation of spherical clouds. In
addition, we find that ejected particles are characterized by highly
non-spherical shapes, whose features can be traced in the initial deviations
from spherical symmetry that are amplified during the dynamical evolution:
particles can indeed form anisotropic configurations, like bars and/or disks,
even though the initial cloud was very close to spherical.

to be a domain expert for e.g. welding and programming to know how the task is
optimally executed. For SMEs such employees are not affordable, nor
cost-effective. Therefore a new system is needed where domain experts from a
specific area, like welding or assembly, can easily program a robot without
knowing anything about programming languages or how to use TeachPads. Such a
system needs to be flexible to adapt to new tasks and functions. These
requirements can be met by using a task based programming approach where the
robot program is built up using a hierarchical structure of process, tasks and
skills. It also needs to be intuitive so that domain experts don't need much
training time on handling the system. Intuitive interaction is achieved by
using different input and output modalities like gesture input, speech input,
or touch input which are suitable for the current task.
  This master thesis focuses on the implementation of a user interface (GUI)
for task based industrial robot programming and evaluates different input
modalities (gesture, speech, touch, pen input) for the interaction with the
system. The evaluation is based on a user study conducted with 30 participants
as a Wizard-Of-Oz experiment, where non expert users had to program assembly
and welding tasks to an industrial robot, using the previously developed GUI
and various input and output modalities.
  The findings of the task analysis and user study are then used for creating a
semantic description which will be used in the cognitive robotics-worker cell
for automatically inferring required system components, and to provide the best
suited input modality.

observational tests to identify the configurations observationally. As
expected, any such identification contains substantial uncertainties. However
the situation in general looks less pessimistic than might be expected. Several
identifications between the phenomenology of individual stars and dynamo models
are suggested. Remarkably, all models discussed predict substantial surface
magnetic activity at rather high stellar latitudes. This prediction looks
unexpected from the viewpoint of our experience observing the Sun (which of
course differs in some fundamental ways from these late-type dwarfs). We stress

of a fragmentation zone, from the tip of the sheets to the free surface, within

uncertainty, and accommodating this uncertainty is an important component of
modern phylogenetic comparative analysis. The birth-death polytomy resolver is
a method of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty that places missing

Recent studies of birds and mammals have used this approach to generate
pseudo-posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees that are complete at the
species level, even in the absence of genetic data for many species. Many
researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream
evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution,
geography, and community assembly. I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies
constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving
traits. Because species are placed on trees at random with respect to trait
values, the birth-death polytomy resolver breaks down natural patterns of trait
phylogenetic structure. Inferences based on these trees are predictably and
often drastically biased in a direction that depends on the underlying (true)
pattern of phylogenetic structure in traits. I illustrate the severity of the
phenomenon for both continuous and discrete traits using examples from a global

spatial data in the frequency domain. Unlike the frequency domain empirical
likelihood (FDEL) methodology for time series (on a regular grid), the
formulation of the spatial FDEL needs special care due to lack of the usual
orthogonality properties of the discrete Fourier transform for irregularly
spaced data and due to presence of nontrivial bias in the periodogram under
different spatial asymptotic structures. A spatial FDEL is formulated in the
paper taking into account the effects of these factors. The main results of the
paper show that Wilks' phenomenon holds for a scaled version of the logarithm
of the proposed empirical likelihood ratio statistic in the sense that it is
asymptotically distribution-free and has a chi-squared limit. As a result, the
proposed spatial FDEL method can be used to build nonparametric, asymptotically
correct confidence regions and tests for covariance parameters that are defined
through spectral estimating equations, for irregularly spaced spatial data. In
comparison to the more common studentization approach, a major advantage of our
method is that it does not require explicit estimation of the standard error of
an estimator, which is itself a very difficult problem as the asymptotic
variances of many common estimators depend on intricate interactions among
several population quantities, including the spectral density of the spatial
process, the spatial sampling density and the spatial asymptotic structure.
Results from a numerical study are also reported to illustrate the methodology
and its finite sample properties.

techniques, it has proved its accuracy and superiority. Many researchers,
however, believe that there is still room for enhancing and improving its
performance accuracy. This explains why, over the past decade, there have been
many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and
strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven
empiricallthat ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a
significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper
is twofold. First, it investigates how data clustering (a well known diversity
technique) can be applied to identify groups of similar decision trees in an RF
in order to eliminate redundant trees by selecting a representative from each
group (cluster). Second, these likely diverse representatives are then used to
produce an extension of RF termed CLUB-DRF that is much smaller in size than
RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, and mostly exhibits higher
performance in terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called
ensemble pruning. Experimental results on 15 real datasets from the UCI
repository prove the superiority of our proposed extension over the traditional
RF. Most of our experiments achieved at least 95% or above pruning level while

  Nevertheless, we uncover some features of the Darboux transformations for CMV
matrices which are in striking contrast with those of the Jacobi case. In
particular, when applied to CMV matrices, the matrix realization of the inverse
Darboux transformations -- what we call 'Darboux transformations with
parameters' -- leads to spurious solutions whose interpretation deserves future
research. Such spurious solutions are neither unitary nor band matrices, so
Darboux transformations for CMV matrices are much more subject to the
subtleties of the algebra of infinite matrices than their Jacobi counterparts.
  A key role in our theory is played by the Cholesky factorizations of infinite
matrices. Actually, the Darboux transformations introduced in this paper are
based on the Cholesky factorizations of degree one Hermitian Laurent
polynomials evaluated on CMV matrices. We also show how these transformations
can be generalized to higher degree Laurent polynomials, as well as to the
extension of CMV matrices to quasi-definite functionals -- what we call
'quasi-CMV' matrices.

Rashba-type spin splitting of electronic states, manifested in a k-dependent
splitting of the bands. While most research had previously focused on 2D
electron systems, recently a three-dimensional (3D) form of such Rashba-effect
was found in a series of bismuth tellurohalides. Whereas these materials
exhibit a very large spin-splitting, they lack an important property concerning
functionalization, namely the possibility to switch or tune the spin texture.
This limitation can be overcome in a new class of functional materials
displaying Rashba-splitting coupled to ferroelectricity: the ferroelectric
Rashba semiconductors (FERS). Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (SARPES) we show that GeTe(111) forms a prime member of this
class, displaying a complex spin-texture for the Rashba-split surface and bulk
bands arising from the intrinsic inversion symmetry breaking caused by the
ferroelectric polarization of the bulk (FE). Apart from pure surface and bulk
states we find surface-bulk resonant states (SBR) whose wavefunctions entangle
the spinors from the bulk and surface contributions. At the Fermi level their
hybridization results in unconventional spin topologies with cochiral
helicities and concomitant gap opening. The GeTe(111) surface and SBR states
make the semiconductor surface conducting. At the same time our SARPES data
confirm that GeTe is a narrow-gap semiconductor, suggesting that GeTe(111)
electronic states are endowed with spin properties that are theoretically
challenging to anticipate. As the helicity of the spins in Rashba bands is
connected to the direction of the FE polarization, this work paves the way to
all-electric non-volatile control of spin-transport properties in
semiconductors.

Theory emerged as the superior doctrine for understanding the interactions

relativistic field theoretical model to be renormalizable were established,
there were two other developments that quickly accelerated acceptance of this
approach: first the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism, and then asymptotic freedom.
Together, these gave us a complete understanding of the perturbative sector of
the theory, enough to give us a detailed picture of what is now usually called
the Standard Model. Crucial for this understanding were the strong indications
and encouragements provided by numerous experimental findings. Subsequently,
non-perturbative features of the quantum field theories were addressed, and the
first proposals for completely unified quantum field theories were launched.
Since the use of continuous symmetries of all sorts, together with other topics
of advanced mathematics, were recognised to be of crucial importance, many new
predictions were pointed out, such as the Higgs particle, supersymmetry and
baryon number violation. There are still many challenges ahead.

clouds is revisited theoretically, with the aim to better understand leading
mechanisms of the explosive desorption of icy mantles. It is rigorously shown
that if the heating of a reactive medium occurs within a sufficiently localized
spot (e.g., heating of mantles by cosmic rays), then the subsequent thermal
evolution is characterized by a single dimensionless number $\lambda$. This
number identifies a bifurcation between two distinct regimes: When $\lambda$
exceeds a critical value (threshold), the heat equation exhibits the explosive
solution, i.e., the thermal (chemical) explosion is triggered. Otherwise,
thermal diffusion causes the deposited heat to spread over the entire grain --
this regime is commonly known as the whole-grain heating. The theory allows us
to find a critical combination of the physical parameters that govern the
explosion of icy mantles due to impulsive spot heating. In particular, the
calculations suggest that heavy cosmic ray species (e.g., iron ions) colliding
with dust are able to trigger the explosion. Based on the recently calculated
local cosmic-ray spectra, the expected rate of the explosive desorption is
estimated. The efficiency of the desorption, which affects all solid species
independent of their binding energy, is shown to be comparable with other
cosmic-ray desorption mechanisms typically considered in the literature. Also,
the theory allows us to estimate maximum abundances of reactive species that
may be stored in the mantles, which provides important constraints on available
astrochemical models.

different aspects of particle creation by looking at energy conservation and at

study the nature of particle creation and vacuum polarization in black hole and

platforms including CPUs, GPUs and Xeon Phi. First, the CSR5 format is
insensitive to the sparsity structure of the input matrix. Thus the single
format can support an SpMV algorithm that is efficient both for regular
matrices and for irregular matrices. Furthermore, we show that the overhead of
the format conversion from the CSR to the CSR5 can be as low as the cost of a
few SpMV operations. We compare the CSR5-based SpMV algorithm with 11
state-of-the-art formats and algorithms on four mainstream processors using 14
regular and 10 irregular matrices as a benchmark suite. For the 14 regular
matrices in the suite, we achieve comparable or better performance over the
previous work. For the 10 irregular matrices, the CSR5 obtains average
performance improvement of 17.6\%, 28.5\%, 173.0\% and 293.3\% (up to 213.3\%,
153.6\%, 405.1\% and 943.3\%) over the best existing work on dual-socket Intel

develops theory for this class of models. In density forecasting, the density
of observations is estimated in regions where the density is not observed.
Identification of the density in such regions is guaranteed by structural
assumptions on the density that allows exact extrapolation. In this paper, the
structural assumption is made that the density is a product of one-dimensional
functions. The theory is quite general in assuming the shape of the region
where the density is observed. Such models naturally arise when the time point
of an observation can be written as the sum of two terms (e.g., onset and
incubation period of a disease). The developed theory also allows for a
multiplicative factor of seasonal effects. Seasonal effects are present in many
actuarial, biostatistical, econometric and statistical studies. Smoothing
estimators are proposed that are based on backfitting. Full asymptotic theory
is derived for them. A practical example from the insurance business is given
producing a within year budget of reported insurance claims. A small sample
study supports the theoretical results.

connections among scalar mesons below and above 1 GeV is recognized and

quark-antiquarks, four-quarks and glue components and play a central role in
understanding the properties of scalar mesons. Iterative Monte Carlo
simulations are first performed on the 14-dimensional parameter space of the
model and sets of points in this parameter space (the global sets) that give an

energy transfer from the beam to the plasma electrons is ensured by the plasma
nonuniformity. The electron beam excites plasma waves whose wavelength and
phase speed gradually decrease towards anode. The short waves near the anode
accelerate plasma bulk electrons to suprathermal energies. The sheath near the
anode reflects some of the accelerated electrons back into the plasma. These
electrons travel through the plasma, reflect near the cathode, and enter the

insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and
the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried
out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also
reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of
Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to
the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat
waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on
the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty
eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate
and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line
pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical
components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3]
or more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\&D effort. In
this context and even if the LHCD system is not part of the construction
baseline, the CEA/IRFM is conducting a R\&D effort in order to validate a
design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the
assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s pill-box type windows prototypes
have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with
the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical
design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the
experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power
results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The
development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL
DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a
ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to
a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device
are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the
rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic,
the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the
circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer.
Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a
narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the
ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be
extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field
topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due
to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the
electric field and

important information about spectroscopic properties of IR bismuth-related
active centers (BAC) the excitation-emission fluorescence spectra for a
spectral region of 220-2000 nm have been measured. The obtained
three-dimensional spectra have been presented for different host glass
compositions: silicate, germanate, aluminosilicate and phosphosilicate.
Energy-level configuration and main radiative transitions associated with BACs
in GeO2 and SiO2 glasses have been revealed. Fluorescence lifetime analysis of
the basic radiative transitions of BAC have been carried out. It has been shown
that the energy-level schemes of BAC-Si and BAC-Ge (BAC associated with silicon
and germanium, respectively) are similar, corresponding BAC-Ge energy levels
lying 10-16% lower than those of BAC-Si. It has been determined that BAC-Si,
BAC-Ge and BAC-Si, BAC-P can exist simultaneously in bismuth-doped
germanosilicate and phosphosilicate fibers, respectively. Optical amplification
in the wavelength range 1410-1470 nm and lasing at 1460 nm in SiO2 glass fiber
doped with bismuth have been demonstrated for the first time. The optical gain
and lasing in this fiber were based on the radiative transition between the
first excited and ground energy levels belonging to BAC-Si. Anti-stokes
luminescence spectra of BAC-Si and BAC-Ge in optical fibers under the two-step
excitation have been measured and analyzed in detail.

communication applications. And it is a notoriously difficult computational
problem to find binary sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelations. The
problem can also be stated in terms of finding binary sequences with minimum
energy levels or maximum merit factor defined by M.J.E. Golay, F=N^2/2E, N and
E being the sequence length and energy respectively. Conjectured asymptotic
value of F is 12.32 for very long sequences. In this paper, a theorem has been
proved to show that there are finite number of possible energy levels, spaced
at an equal interval of 4, for the binary sequence of a particular length. Two
more theorems are proved to derive the theoretical minimum energy level of a
binary sequence of even and odd length of N to be N/2, and N-1/2 respectively,
making the merit factor equal to N and N^2/N-1 respectively. The derived
theoretical minimum energy level successfully explains the case of N =13, for
which the merit factor (F =14.083) is higher than the conjectured value.
Sequence of lengths 4, 5, 7, 11, 13 are also found to be following the
theoretical minimum energy level. These sequences are exactly the Barker
sequences which are widely used in direct-sequence spread spectrum and pulse
compression radar systems because of their low autocorrelation properties.
Further analysis shows physical reasoning in support of the conjecture that
Barker sequences exists only when N <= 13 (this has been proven for all odd N).

followed-up 196 of them using X-shooter on the VLT. The large wavelength
coverage (0.30-2.48 $\mu$m) and moderate resolution (R~5000-9000) of X-shooter
allowed us to identify peculiar objects including 22 blue L dwarfs, 2 blue T
dwarfs, and 2 low gravity M dwarfs. Using a spectral indices-based technique we
identified 27 unresolved binary candidates, for which we determined the
spectral type of the potential components via spectral deconvolution. The
spectra allowed us to measure the equivalent width of the prominent absorption
features and to compare them to atmospheric models. Cross-correlating the
spectra with a radial velocity standard, we measured the radial velocity for
our targets, and we determined the distribution of the sample, which is centred
at -1.7$\pm$1.2 km s$^{-1}$ with a dispersion of 31.5 km s$^{-1}$. Using our
results we estimated the space density of field brown dwarfs and compared it
with the results of numerical simulations. Depending on the binary fraction, we
found that there are (0.85$\pm$0.55) x 10$^{-3}$ to (1.00$\pm$0.64) x 10$^{-3}$
objects per cubic parsec in the L4-L6.5 range, (0.73$\pm$0.47) x 10$^{-3}$ to

transition with respect to the late T dwarfs, a discrepancy that could be
explained assuming a higher binary fraction than expected for the L/T

give a detailed description of its power in the case of two predictors.

bipartite networks have been recognized to provide a particularly insightful
representation of many systems, ranging from mutualistic networks in ecology to
trade networks in economy, whence the need of a pattern detection-oriented
analysis in order to identify statistically-significant structural properties.
Such an analysis rests upon the definition of suitable null models, i.e. upon
the choice of the portion of network structure to be preserved while
randomizing everything else. However, quite surprisingly, little work has been
done so far to define null models for real bipartite networks. The aim of the
present work is to fill this gap, extending a recently-proposed method to
randomize monopartite networks to bipartite networks. While the proposed
formalism is perfectly general, we apply our method to the binary, undirected,
bipartite representation of the World Trade Web, comparing the observed values
of a number of structural quantities of interest with the expected ones,
calculated via our randomization procedure. Interestingly, the behavior of the

self-gravitating viscous accretion discs. The vertically integrated equations
are simplified using the slow accretion limit and the monopole approximation
with a time-dependent central point mass to account for self-gravity and
accretion. It is shown that the system of partial differential equations can be
reduced to a single non-linear advection diffusion equation which describes the
time evolution of angular velocity.
  In order to solve the equation three different turbulent viscosity
prescriptions are considered. It is shown that for these parametrizations the
differential equation allows for similarity transformations depending only on a
single non-dimensional parameter. A detailed analysis of the similarity
solutions reveals that this parameter is the initial power law exponent of the
angular velocity distribution at large radii. The radial dependence of the
self-similar solutions is in most cases given by broken power laws. At small
radii the rotation law always becomes Keplerian with respect to the current
central point mass. In the outer regions the power law exponent of the rotation
law deviates from the Keplerian value and approaches asymptotically the value
determined by the initial condition. It is shown that accretion discs with
flatter rotation laws at large radii yield higher accretion rates.
  The methods are applied to self-gravitating accretion discs in active
galactic nuclei. Fully self-gravitating discs are found to evolve faster than
nearly Keplerian discs. The implications on supermassive black hole formation

mechanistic nonlinear mixed-effect model. The design of the study and the
parameter values were inspired from one arm of a clinical trial. Increasingly
high levels of association between PSA and survival were considered and results
were compared with those found using two simplified alternatives to joint
model, a two-stage and a joint sequential model. We found that joint model
allowed for a precise estimation of all longitudinal and survival parameters.
In particular the effect of PSA kinetics on survival could be precisely
estimated, regardless of the strength of the association. In contrast, both
simplified approaches led to bias on longitudinal parameters and two-stage
model systematically underestimated the effect of PSA kinetics on survival. In
summary we showed that joint model can be used to characterize the relationship
between a nonlinear kinetics and survival. This opens the way for the use of
more complex and physiological models to improve treatment evaluation and
prediction in oncology.

The boundary element solution is subsequently used to pose a shape optimization

suggests that the optimum fin is infinitely thin and that there exists a
critical Biot number that characterizes whether the addition of the fin would
result in an enhancement of heat transfer. The existence of a critical Biot

by Breiman over a decade ago. Compared with other ensemble techniques, it has
proved its accuracy and superiority. Many researchers, however, believe that
there is still room for enhancing and improving its performance in terms of
predictive accuracy. This explains why, over the past decade, there have been
many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and
strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven
empirically that ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a
significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper
is twofolds. First, it investigates how an unsupervised learning technique,
namely, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) can be used to identify diverse trees in the
RF. Second, trees with the highest LOF scores are then used to produce an
extension of RF termed LOFB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet
performs at least as good as RF, but mostly exhibits higher performance in
terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called ensemble
pruning. Experimental results on 10 real datasets prove the superiority of our
proposed extension over the traditional RF. Unprecedented pruning levels
reaching 99% have been achieved at the time of boosting the predictive accuracy
of the ensemble. The notably high pruning level makes the technique a good
candidate for real-time applications.

into the Tikhonov regularization framework and we perform the Principal
Component Analysis decomposition, which is well known for its compaction
properties. The method yields a simple closed form analytical solution that
does not require iter- ative processing. Moreover, from the Bayes theory the
properties of regularized solution, especially its covariance matrix, may be
easily derived. This is the key to introduce and prove the formula for
calculations of the signal recovery error. In this paper we show that an
average recovery error is approximately inversely proportional to the number of

in a reliable and efficient manner in distributed storage systems. We propose a
new storage technique called differential erasure coding (DEC) where the
differences (deltas) between subsequent versions are stored rather than the
whole objects, akin to a typical delta encoding technique. However, unlike
delta encoding techniques, DEC opportunistically exploits the sparsity (i.e.,
when the differences between two successive versions have few non-zero entries)
in the updates to store the deltas using compressed sensing techniques applied
with erasure coding. We first show that DEC provides significant savings in the
storage size for versioned data whenever the update patterns are characterized
by in-place alterations. Subsequently, we propose a practical DEC framework so
as to reap storage size benefits against not just in-place alterations but also
real-world update patterns such as insertions and deletions that alter the
overall data sizes. We conduct experiments with several synthetic workloads to
demonstrate that the practical variant of DEC provides significant reductions
in storage overhead (up to 60\% depending on the workload) compared to baseline
storage system which incorporates concepts from Rsync, a delta encoding
technique to store and synchronize data across a network.

deception - especially in cyberspace - is both crucial and difficult. Recent
work in this area has used game theory to study the roles of incentives and
rational behavior. Building upon this work, we employ a game-theoretic model
for the purpose of mechanism design. Specifically, we study a defensive use of
deception: implementation of honeypots for network defense. How does the design
problem change when an adversary develops the ability to detect honeypots? We
analyze two models: cheap-talk games and an augmented version of those games
that we call cheap-talk games with evidence, in which the receiver can detect
deception with some probability. Our first contribution is this new model for
deceptive interactions. We show that the model includes traditional signaling
games and complete information games as special cases. We also demonstrate
numerically that deception detection sometimes eliminate pure-strategy
equilibria. Finally, we present the surprising result that the utility of a
deceptive defender can sometimes increase when an adversary develops the
ability to detect deception. These results apply concretely to network defense.
They are also general enough for the large and critical body of strategic
interactions that involve deception.

massive data sets using weighted affinity graphs; Orientable Diffusion Maps and
Vector Diffusion Maps enrich these graphs by attaching to each node also some
local geometry. HDM likewise considers a scenario where each node possesses
additional structure, which is now itself of interest to investigate.
Virtually, HDM augments the original data set with attached structures, and
provides tools for studying and organizing the augmented ensemble. The goal is
to obtain information on individual structures attached to the nodes and on the
relationship between structures attached to nearby nodes, so as to study the
underlying manifold from which the nodes are sampled. In this paper, we analyze
HDM on tangent bundles, revealing its intimate connection with sub-Riemannian
geometry and a family of hypoelliptic differential operators. In a later paper,
we shall consider more general fibre bundles.

temperature and the redshift, i.e., the $T$--$z$ relation, is examined in a
phenomenological dissipative model. The model contains two constant terms, as
if a nonzero cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and a dissipative process are
operative in a homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat universe. The
$T$--$z$ relation is derived from a general radiative temperature law, as
appropriate for describing nonequilibrium states in a creation of cold dark
matter (CCDM) model. Using this relation, the radiation temperature in the late
universe is calculated as a function of a dissipation rate ranging from
$\tilde{\mu} =0$, corresponding to a nondissipative $\Lambda$CDM model, to
$\tilde{\mu} =1$, corresponding to a fully dissipative CCDM model. The $T$--$z$
relation for $\tilde{\mu} =0$ is linear for standard cosmology and is
consistent with observations. However, with increasing dissipation rate
$\tilde{\mu}$, the radiation temperature gradually deviates from a linear law
because the effective equation-of-state parameter varies with time. When the
background evolution of the universe agrees with a fine-tuned pure $\Lambda$CDM
model, the $T$--$z$ relation for low $\tilde{\mu}$ matches observations,
whereas the $T$--$z$ relation for high $\tilde{\mu}$ does not. Previous work
also found that a weakly dissipative model accords with measurements of a
growth rate for clustering related to structure formations. These results imply
that low dissipation is likely for the universe. The weakly dissipative model
should be further constrained by recent observations.

applications and environmental flows, yet little is known about the behavior of
finite-size particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. To fill this gap, we
perform Direct Numerical Simulations of sedimentation in quiescent and
turbulent environments using an Immersed Boundary Method to account for the
dispersed rigid spherical particles. The solid volume fractions considered are
0.5-1%, while the solid to fluid density ratio 1.02. The particle radius is
chosen to be approximately 6 Komlogorov lengthscales. The results show that the
mean settling velocity is lower in an already turbulent flow than in a
quiescent fluid. The reduction with respect to a single particle in quiescent
fluid is about 12\% and 14\% for the two volume fractions investigated. The
probability density function of the particle velocity is almost Gaussian in a
turbulent flow, whereas it displays large positive tails in quiescent fluid.
These tails are associated to the intermittent fast sedimentation of particle
pairs in drafting-kissing-tumbling motions. The particle lateral dispersion is
higher in a turbulent flow, whereas the vertical one is, surprisingly, of
comparable magnitude as a consequence of the highly intermittent behavior
observed in the quiescent fluid. Using the concept of mean relative velocity we
estimate the mean drag coefficient from empirical formulas and show that non
stationary effects, related to vortex shedding, explain the increased reduction
in mean settling velocity in a turbulent environment.
