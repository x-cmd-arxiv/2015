spatial dimension, which result in quantum speedups that range from
superpolynomial to polynomial. We first describe a method to simulate the
evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) based on a refined analysis
of the Trotter-Suzuki formula that exploits the Lie algebra structure. For
total evolution time $t$ and precision $\epsilon>0$, the complexity of our
method is $ O(\exp(\gamma \sqrt{\log(N/\epsilon)}))$, where $\gamma>0$ is a
constant and $N$ is the quantum number associated with an ""energy cutoff"" of
the initial state. Remarkably, this complexity is subpolynomial in
$N/\epsilon$. We also provide a method to prepare discrete versions of the
eigenstates of the QHO of complexity polynomial in $\log(N)/\epsilon$, where
$N$ is the dimension or number of points in the discretization. This method may
be of independent interest as it provides a way to prepare, e.g., quantum
states with Gaussian-like amplitudes. Next, we consider a system with a quartic
potential. Our numerical simulations suggest a method for simulating the
evolution of sublinear complexity $\tilde O(N^{1/3+o(1)})$, for constant $t$
and $\epsilon$. We also analyze complex one-dimensional systems and prove a
complexity bound $\tilde O(N)$, under fairly general assumptions. Our quantum
algorithms may find applications in other problems. As an example, we discuss
the fractional Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform
that is useful for signal analysis and can be formulated in terms of the
evolution of the QHO.

"1503.06320","Jeremy Berquist","Jeremy Berquist","Rational and Semi-Rational Singularities",,,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is a conjecture of Koll\'ar that a variety $X$ with rational singularities
in some open subvariety $U$ has a rationalification; that is, a proper,
birational morphism $f: Y \rightarrow X$ such that $Y$ has rational
singularities, and which is an isomorphism over $U$. Whether this is true is
already unknown in the case of a (normal) threefold with rational singularities
along a curve $C$ except at a single point $p \in C$. There is an analogous
conjecture for demi-normal varieties $X$, where we must insist that $Y$ has
only semi-rational singularities. Our main result is that if a stronger version
of Koll\'ar's conjecture is true for rational (normal) singularities, then the
analogous conjecture is true for Gorenstein semi-rational (non-normal)
singularities. We illustrate this first for surfaces. As the same procedure
does not carry over directly to higher dimensions, we must use a slightly
different proof for that case. We include conditions under which the
Cohen-Macaulay property (slightly weaker than that of having rational
singularities) is preserved when passing between a demi-normal variety and its
normalization. It is this condition that is automatic for surfaces and which
makes a proof slightly different in higher dimensions. In fact, it is not the
case that the normalization of a Cohen-Macaulay variety is Cohen-Macaulay (or
vice-versa, as is already apparent with surfaces). These auxiliary results are
needed for the proof of the general result, but they are interesting in their
own right. The proof of the general statement is at the end of the paper.

random continuous functions from $2^\omega$ to $2^\omega$, and algorithmically
random Borel probability measures on $2^\omega$, especially the interplay
between these three classes of objects. Our main tools are preservation of
randomness and its converse, the no randomness ex nihilo principle, which say
together that given an almost-everywhere defined computable map between an
effectively compact probability space and an effective Polish space, a real is
Martin-L\""of random for the pushforward measure if and only if its preimage is
random with respect to the measure on the domain. These tools allow us to prove
new facts, some of which answer previously open questions, and reprove some
known results more simply.
  Our main results are the following. First we answer an open question of
Barmapalias, Brodhead, Cenzer, Remmel, and Weber by showing that
$\mathcal{X}\subseteq2^\omega$ is a random closed set if and only if it is the
set of zeros of a random continuous function on $2^\omega$. As a corollary we
obtain the result that the collection of random continuous functions on
$2^\omega$ is not closed under composition. Next, we construct a computable
measure $Q$ on the space of measures on $2^\omega$ such that
$\mathcal{X}\subseteq2^\omega$ is a random closed set if and only if
$\mathcal{X}$ is the support of a $Q$-random measure. We also establish a
correspondence between random closed sets and the random measures studied by
Culver in previous work. Lastly, we study the ranges of random continuous
functions, showing that the Lebesgue measure of the range of a random
continuous function is always contained in $(0,1)$.

transitions but nevertheless evolve in real time. Importantly, we argue that
the cross section at energies above E_rt(N) is computed perturbatively in the
background of the latter solutions, and the terms of this perturbative
expansion stay bounded in the infinite-energy limit. Transitions in the
high-energy regime proceed via emission of many soft quanta with total energy
E_rt; the energy excess E-E_rt remains in the colliding particles till the end
of the process.

given pointwise proper action of a Lie group $G$ on $M$. Here, paths are
embeddings of a compact interval into $M$. There are at least two types of
symmetries: Firstly, paths that are parts of an integral curve of a fundamental
vector field on $M$ (continuous symmetry). Secondly, paths that can be
decomposed into finitely many pieces, each of which is the translate of some
free segment, where possibly the translate is cut at the two ends of the paths
(discrete symmetry). Here, a free segment is a path $e$ whose $G$-translates
either equal $e$ or intersect it in at most finitely many points. Note that all
the statements above are understood up to the parametrization of the paths. We
will show, for the category of analytic manifolds, that each path is of exactly
one of either types.
  For the proof, we use that the overlap of a path $\gamma$ with one of its
translates is encoded uniquely in a mapping between subsets of $\dom\gamma$.
Running over all translates, these mappings form the so-called
reparametrization set to $\gamma$. It will turn out that, up to conjugation
with a diffeomorphism, any such set is given by the action of a Lie subgroup of
$O(2)$ on $S^1$, restricted in domain and range to some compact interval on
$S^1$. Now, the infinite subgroups correspond to the continuous symmetry above,
finite ones to the discrete symmetry.

artificial or natural, plays a significant role in how these systems operate.
As a result, much emphasis has been placed on accurately describing networks
using network theoretic metrics. When it comes to generating networks with
similar properties, however, the set of available techniques and properties
that can be controlled for remains limited. Further, whilst it is becoming
clear that some of the metrics currently used to control the generation of such
networks are not very prescriptive so that networks could potentially exhibit
very different higher-order structure within those constraints, network
generating algorithms typically produce fairly contrived networks and lack
mechanisms by which to systematically explore the space of network solutions.
In this paper, we explore the potential of a multi-objective novelty-biased GA
to provide a viable alternative to these algorithms. We believe our results
provide the first proof of principle that (i) it is possible to use GAs to
generate graphs satisfying set levels of key classical graph theoretic
properties and (ii) it is possible to generate diverse solutions within these
constraints. The paper is only a preliminary step, however, and we identify key
avenues for further development.

al., 2014) rely on Selective Search (Uijlings et al., 2013) to propose regions
which with high probability represent objects, where in turn CNNs are deployed
for classification. Selective Search represents a family of sophisticated
algorithms that are engineered with multiple segmentation, appearance and
saliency cues, typically coming with a significant run-time overhead.
Furthermore, (Hosang et al., 2014) have shown that most methods suffer from low
reproducibility due to unstable superpixels, even for slight image
perturbations. Although CNNs are subsequently used for classification in
top-performing object-detection pipelines, current proposal methods are
agnostic to how these models parse objects and their rich learned

high-level objects or totally miss some of them. To overcome these drawbacks we
propose a boosting approach which directly takes advantage of hierarchical CNN
features for detecting regions of interest fast. We demonstrate its performance

Existing systemic risk measures can usually be interpreted as the minimal

contrast, our approach also includes systemic risk measures that can be
interpreted as the minimal capital funds that secure the aggregated system by
allocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual
risks. This allows for a possible ranking of the institutions in terms of
systemic riskiness measured by the optimal allocations. Moreover, we also allow

susceptible to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of the wireless
propagation medium. Recent works have proposed the use of interference to
reduce eavesdropping capabilities in wireless wiretap networks. However, the
concurrent effect of interference on both eavesdropping receivers (ERs) and
legitimate receivers (LRs) has not been thoroughly investigated, and carefully
engineering the network interference is required to harness the full potential
of interference for wireless secrecy. This two part paper addresses this issue
by proposing a generalized interference alignment (GIA) technique, which
jointly designs the transceivers at the legitimate partners to impede the ERs
without interfering with LRs. In Part I, we have established a theoretical
framework for the GIA technique. In Part II, we will first propose an efficient
GIA algorithm that is applicable to large-scale networks and then evaluate the
performance of this algorithm in stochastic wireless wiretap network via both
analysis and simulation. These results reveal insights into when and how GIA
contributes to wireless secrecy.

the systematic variation in the apparent magnitudes of the Arrhenius parameters
$E_a$, the energy of activation, and $\nu$, the preexponential factor, as a
response to perturbations. If, in a series of closely related activated
processes, these parameters exhibit a strong linear correlation, it is expected
that an isokinetic relation will occur, then the rates $k$ become the same at a
common compensation temperature $T_c$. The reality of these two phenomena
continues to be debated as they have not been explicitly demonstrated and their
physical origins remain poorly understood. Using kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations on a model interface, we explore how site and adsorbate
interactions influence the Arrhenius parameters during a typical desorption
process. We find that their transient variations result in a net partial
compensation, due to the variations in the prefactor not being large enough to
completely offset those in $E_a$, both in plots that exhibit a high degree of
linearity and in curved non-Arrhenius plots. In addition, the observed
isokinetic relation arises due to a transition to a non-interacting regime, and
not due to compensation between $E_a$ and $\ln{\nu}$. We expect our results to
provide a deeper insight into the microscopic events that originate
compensation effects and isokinetic relations in our system, and in other
fields where these effects have been reported.

package causing current leakage or short circuits and raising significant
reliability issues. The nature of metal whiskers remains a mystery after
several decades of research. In addition, metal whiskers exhibit a rather
unusual dynamic property of relatively high amplitude movements under gentle
air flow or, according to some testimonies, without obvious stimuli.
Understanding the physics behind that motion would give additional insights
into the nature of metal whiskers. Here, we quantitatively analyze several
possible mechanisms potentially responsible for the observed movements: (1)
minute air currents, (2) Brownian motion due to random bombardments with the
air molecules, (3) mechanically caused movements, such as (a) externally
transmitted vibrations of the sample, and (b) torque exerted due to material
propagation along curved whiskers responsible for the whisker growth (similar
to the known garden hose oscillations), (4) time dependent electric fields due
to diffusion of ions across the metal surface, and (5) nonequilibrium electric
field configurations making it possible for {\it some} whiskers to move. For
all these scenarios we provide numerical estimates. Our conclusion is that the
observed movements are likely due to the minor air currents, intentional or
ill-controlled, and that external mechanical vibrations could force such
movements in a rather harsh environment or/and for whiskers with severe
constrictions. We argue that under non-steady state conditions, such as caused
by changes in the external light intensity, some whiskers can exercise
spontaneous oscillations.

exchange gives rise to d-wave superconductivity is well known. Several groups
recently argued that the same spin-mediated interaction may also account for
charge-density-wave order with momenta $(Q,0)$ or $(0,Q)$, detected in
underdoped cuprates. This has been questioned on the basis that
charge-density-wave channel mixes fermions from both nested and anti-nested
regions on the Fermi surface, and fermions in the anti-nested region do not
have a natural tendency to form a bound state, even if the interaction is
attractive. We show that anti-nesting is not an obstacle for charge order, but
to see this one needs to go beyond the conventional Eliashberg approximation.
We show that in the prefect nesting/antinesting case, when the velocities of
hot fermions are either parallel or antiparallel, the onset temperatures in
superconducting and charge-density-wave channels are of comparable strength for
any magnetic correlation length $\xi$. The superconducting $T_{\rm sc}$ is
larger than $T_{\rm cdw}$, but only numerically. When the velocities of hot
fermions are not strictly parallel/antiparallel, $T_{\rm cdw}$ progressively
decreases as $\xi$ decreases and vanishes at some critical $\xi$.

the robot should be capable of operating under partial observability of the
environment. Object occlusions and unmodeled environments are some of the
factors that result in partial observability. A common scenario where this is
encountered is manipulation in clutter. In the case that the robot needs to
locate an object of interest and manipulate it, it needs to perform a series of
decluttering actions to accurately detect the object of interest. To perform
such a series of actions, the robot also needs to account for the dynamics of
objects in the environment and how they react to contact. This is a non trivial
problem since one needs to reason not only about robot-object interactions but
also object-object interactions in the presence of contact. In the example
scenario of manipulation in clutter, the state vector would have to account for
the pose of the object of interest and the structure of the surrounding
environment. The process model would have to account for all the aforementioned
robot-object, object-object interactions. The complexity of the process model
grows exponentially as the number of objects in the scene increases. This is
commonly the case in unstructured environments. Hence it is not reasonable to
attempt to model all object-object and robot-object interactions explicitly.
Under this setting we propose a hypothesis based action selection algorithm
where we construct a hypothesis set of the possible poses of an object of
interest given the current evidence in the scene and select actions based on
our current set of hypothesis. This hypothesis set tends to represent the
belief about the structure of the environment and the number of poses the
object of interest can take. The agent's only stopping criterion is when the
uncertainty regarding the pose of the object is fully resolved.

This makes the middlebox deployment and maintenance tasks even more

We also carry out Monte Carlo simulations based on these current SLSN Ic
measurements to estimate how large the sample would have to be in order to rule
out either model at a $\sim 99.7\%$ confidence level. The currently available
sample indicates a likelihood of $\sim$$70-80\%$ that the $R_{\rm h}=ct$
Universe is the correct cosmology versus $\sim$$20-30\%$ for the standard
model. These results are suggestive, though not yet compelling, given the
current limited number of SLSNe Ic. We find that if the real cosmology is
$\Lambda$CDM, a sample of $\sim$$240$ SLSNe Ic would be sufficient to rule out
$R_{\rm h}=ct$ at this level of confidence, while $\sim$$480$ SLSNe Ic would be
required to rule out $\Lambda$CDM if the real Universe is instead $R_{\rm

free parameters available to fit the data with $\Lambda$CDM. If such SLSNe Ic
are commonly detected in the future, they could be a powerful tool for
constraining the dark-energy equation of state in $\Lambda$CDM, and
differentiating between this model and the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ Universe.

we observe each entry with probabilities proportional to the sum of
corresponding row and column leverage scores, minus their product. We show that
this relaxation in sampling probabilities (as opposed to sum of leverage scores
in Chen et al, 2014) can give us an $O(\varrho^2\log^2(m+n))$ additive
improvement on the (best known) sample size obtained by Chen et al, 2014, for

theoretical improvement on sample size. Further, exact recovery of $(a)$

our relaxed leverage score sampling, via nuclear norm minimization, without

runtime plans in order to automatically reflect all successive optimization

leveraged by several advanced optimizers like resource optimization and global

quantitatively different scaling regimes depending on whether the correlation

the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His 1964 theorem is the
incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the joint assumptions of Locality and
Predetermination. His 1976 theorem is their incompatibility with the single
property of Local Causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions,
that his 1964 theorem began with the assumption of Local Causality, even if not
by that name. Although the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their
assumptions are not. Hence, the earlier and later theorems suggest quite
different conclusions, embraced by operationalists and realists, respectively.
The key issue is whether Locality or Local Causality is the appropriate notion
emanating from Relativistic Causality, and this rests on one's basic notion of
causation. For operationalists the appropriate notion is what is here called
the Principle of Agent-Causation, while for realists it is Reichenbach's
Principle of common cause. By breaking down the latter into even more basic
Postulates, it is possible to obtain a version of Bell's theorem in which each
camp could reject one assumption, happy that the remaining assumptions reflect
its weltanschauung. Formulating Bell's theorem in terms of causation is
fruitful not just for attempting to reconcile the two camps, but also for
better describing the ontology of different quantum interpretations and for
more deeply understanding the implications of Bell's marvellous work.

of shift of the Raman 2D band wavenumber per unit strain was less than 25% of
that of flat flakes of mechanically-exfoliated graphene, whereas the rate of
band broadening per unit strain was about 75% of that of the exfoliated

mechanically-isolated graphene islands separated by the graphene wrinkles, with
the strain distribution in each graphene island determined using shear lag
analysis. The effect of the size and position of the Raman laser beam spot has
also been incorporated in the model. The predictions fit well with the behavior

65~$\mu$m (N60), 90~$\mu$m (WIDE-S), 140~$\mu$m (WIDE-L),and 160~$\mu$m (N160).
Absolute flux calibration was determined by comparing the data with the
COBE/DIRBE data sets, and the intensity range was as wide as from a few
MJy~sr$^{-1}$ to $>$1~GJy~sr$^{-1}$. The uncertainties are considered to be the
standard deviations with respect to the DIRBE data, and they are less than 10\%
for intensities above 10, 3, 25, and 26~MJy~sr$^{-1}$ at the N60, WIDE-S,
WIDE-L, and N160 bands, respectively. The characteristics of point sources in
the image were also determined by stacking maps centred on photometric standard
stars. The full width at half maxima of the point spread functions (PSFs) were
63$""$, 78$""$, and 88$""$ at the N60, WIDE-S, and WIDE-L bands, respectively. The
PSF at the N160 band was not obtained due to the sensitivity, but it is thought
to be the same as that of the WIDE-L one.

In the case that the intertwining operator algebras involve intertwining

give the proofs of these results in [H9] and we formulate and prove results for

identity for intertwining operator algebras is equivalent to generalized
rationality, commutativity and associativity properties of intertwining
operator algebras. We introduce the locality for intertwining operator algebras
and show that the Jacobi identity is equivalent to the locality, assuming that
other axioms hold. Moreover, we establish that any two of the three properties,
associativity, commutativity and skew-symmetry, imply the other (except that
when deriving skew-symmetry from associativity and commutativity, more
conditions are needed). Finally, we show that three definitions of intertwining

last few years as a natural mechanism to extend the powerful flexibility of
Gaussian processes to the setup of multiple output variables. The key point
here is the ability to design kernel functions that allow exploiting the
correlations between the outputs while fulfilling the positive definiteness
requisite for the covariance function. Alternatives to construct these
covariance functions are the linear model of coregionalization and process
convolutions. Each of these methods demand the specification of the number of
latent Gaussian process used to build the covariance function for the outputs.
We propose in this paper, the use of an Indian Buffet process as a way to
perform model selection over the number of latent Gaussian processes. This type
of model is particularly important in the context of latent force models, where
the latent forces are associated to physical quantities like protein profiles
or latent forces in mechanical systems. We use variational inference to
estimate posterior distributions over the variables involved, and show examples
of the model performance over artificial data, a motion capture dataset, and a

have been receiving recent attention because they are distinguishable exotic
states of matter poised between a crystal and liquid with novel properties. The
task of formulating an ensemble theory that yields analytical predictions for
the structural characteristics and other properties of stealthy degenerate
ground states in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is highly nontrivial because
the dimensionality of the configuration space depends on the number density
$\rho$ and there is a multitude of ways of sampling the ground-state manifold,

some initial steps in this direction. Specifically, we derive general exact

as a function of $\rho$ in any $d$, and show how disordered degenerate ground
states arise as part of the ground-state manifold. We then specialize our
results to the canonical ensemble by exploiting an ansatz that stealthy states
behave remarkably like ""pseudo"" equilibrium hard-sphere systems in Fourier
space. Our theoretical predictions for the structure and thermodynamic
properties of the stealthy disordered ground states and associated excited
states are in excellent agreement with computer simulations across the first

a specific integer k. First, we proved that k should be either 1, 4 or 9.
Second, we classify these integers as (10, 1)- reverse multiples, (10, 4)-
reverse multiples and (10, 9)- reverse multiples. Then we conclude their
general form.

algebra of the bisexual population (EABP) defined by Ladra and Rozikov. We show
that gonosomal algebras can represent algebraically a wide variety of sex
determination systems observed in bisexual populations. We illustrate this by
about twenty genetic examples, most of these examples cannot be represented by
an EABP. We give seven algebraic constructions of gonosomal algebras, each is
illustrated by genetic examples. We show that unlike the EABP gonosomal
algebras are not dibaric. We approach the existence of dibaric function and
idempotent in gonosomal algebras.

  Compositions","Submitted and provisionally accepted (Journal of Integer Sequences)",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An integer composition of a nonnegative integer $n$ is a tuple
$(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_k)$ of nonnegative integers whose sum is $n$; the $\pi_i$'s
are called the parts of the composition. For fixed number $k$ of parts, the
number of $f$-weighted integer compositions (also called $f$-colored integer
compositions in the literature), in which each part size $s$ may occur in
$f(s)$ different colors, is given by the extended binomial coefficient
$\binom{k}{n}_{f}$. We derive several congruence properties for
$\binom{k}{n}_{f}$, most of which are analogous to those for ordinary binomial
coefficients. Among them is the parity of $\binom{k}{n}_{f}$, Babbage's
congruence, Lucas' theorem, etc. We also give congruences for $c_{f}(n)$, the
number of $f$-weighted integer compositions with arbitrarily many parts, and
for extended binomial coefficient sums. We close with an application of our
results to prime criteria for weighted integer compositions.

The total entropy of this world ensemble, which can be expressed as a sum of
information, thermodynamic and entanglement components, is assumed to be always
zero. This condition suggests information quantization, which we associate with
the Planck's action. Then the entropy neutrality condition for the universe
leads to the zero-action principle. We show that the main concepts of classical
space-time and gravity naturally emerge in this picture. A generalized least
action principle, which embraces the maximal entropy principles of information
theory, is introduced.
