Turing machines called orchestrated machines. Like universal Turing machines,
orchestrated machines are also designed to simulate Turing machines but they
can also modify the original operation of the included Turing machines to
create a new layer of some kind of collective behavior. Using this new model we
can define some interested notions related to cooperation ability of Turing

$\mathrm{ATF}(\mathbb{Z}\times\Lambda_0)$ group -- that is, a group admitting a
free affine action without inversions on a $\mathbb{Z}\times\Lambda_0$-tree --
admits a natural graph of groups decomposition, where vertex groups inherit
actions on $\Lambda_0$-trees. Using recent work of various authors, it follows
that a finitely generated group admitting a free affine action on a
$\mathbb{Z}^n$-tree where no line has its orientation reversed is relatively
hyperbolic with nilpotent parabolics, is locally quasiconvex, and has solvable
word, conjugacy and isomorphism problems.
  Conversely, given a graph of groups satisfying certain conditions, we show
how an affine action of its fundamental group can be constructed. Specialising
to the case of free affine actions, we obtain a large class of
$\mathrm{ATF}(\mathbb{Z}\times\Lambda_0)$ groups that do not act freely by
isometries on any $\Lambda_1$-tree. We also give an example of a group that

efficiently bridge the size-mismatch between nanoscale volumes and far-field

achieve polarized, directional and resonantly enhanced light emission from

leaked. Most users, however, prefer password-only authentication. One reason
why two-factor authentication is so unpopular is the extra steps that the user
must complete in order to log in. Currently deployed two-factor authentication
mechanisms require the user to interact with his phone to, for example, copy a
verification code to the browser. Two-factor authentication schemes that
eliminate user-phone interaction exist, but require additional software to be
deployed.
  In this paper we propose Sound-Proof, a usable and deployable two-factor
authentication mechanism. Sound-Proof does not require interaction between the
user and his phone. In Sound-Proof the second authentication factor is the
proximity of the user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity
of the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their
microphones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so
that the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication.
Sound-Proof can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major
browsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We
provide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to
determine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if
the phone is in a pocket or purse. We conduct a user study designed to compare
the perceived usability of Sound-Proof with Google 2-Step Verification.
Participants ranked Sound-Proof as more usable and the majority would be
willing to use Sound-Proof even for scenarios in which two-factor
authentication is optional.

non-trivial structure at small scales, an appropriate semi-classical
description of it should be based on non-local bi-tensors instead of local
tensors such as the metric $g_{ab}$. Two most relevant bi-tensors in this
context are Synge's World function $\Omega(p,p_0)$ and the van Vleck
determinant (VVD) $\Delta(p,p_0)$, as they encode the metric properties of
spacetime and (de)focussing behaviour of geodesics. They also characterize the
leading short distance behavior of two point functions of the d'Alembartian
$_{p_0} \square_p$. We begin by discussing the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry
of equi-geodesic surfaces $\Sigma_{G,p_0}$ defined by $\Omega(p,p_0)=constant$
in a geodesically convex neighbourhood of an event $p_0$, and highlight some
elementary identities relating the VVD with geometry of these surfaces. As an
aside, we also comment on the contribution of $\Sigma_{G,p_0}$ to the surface
term in the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action and show that it can be written as a
volume integral of $\square \ln \Delta$. We then study the small scale
structure of spacetime in presence of a Lorentz invariant short distance
cut-off $\ell_0$ using $\Omega$ and $\Delta$, based on some recently developed
ideas. We derive a 2nd rank bi-tensor $q_{ab}$ which naturally yields geodesic
intervals bounded from below, and present a general and mathematically rigorous
analysis of short distance structure of spacetime based on (a) geometry of
$\Sigma_{G,p_0}$, (b) structure of the non local d'Alembartian associated with
$q_{ab}$, and (c) properties of the VVD. In particular, we show that the Ricci
bi-scalar of $q_{ab}$ is completely determined by $\Sigma_{G,p_0}$, the tidal

problem. The advent of high-throughput genomic sequencing has made available
extensive data from which, in principle, one can infer the underlying structure
on which biological functions rely. In this paper, we present a new method
aimed at extracting sites encoding structural and func- tional properties from
a set of protein primary sequences, namely a Multiple Sequence Alignment. The
method, called Critical Variable Selection, is based on the idea that subsets
of relevant sites cor- respond to subsequences that occur with a particularly
broad frequency distribution in the dataset. By applying this algorithm to in
silico sequences, to the Response Regulator Receiver and to the Voltage Sensor
Domain of Ion Channels, we show that this procedure recovers not only
information encoded in single site statistics and pairwise correlations but it
also captures dependencies going beyond pairwise correlations. The method
proposed here is complementary to Statistical Coupling Analysis, in that the
most relevant sites predicted by the two methods markedly differ. We find
robust and consistent results for datasets as small as few hundred sequences,
that reveal a hidden hierarchy of sites that is consistent with present
knowledge on biologically relevant sites and evo- lutionary dynamics. This
suggests that Critical Variable Selection is able to identify in a Multiple
Sequence Alignment a core of sites encoding functional and structural
information.

Stevenson's characterization of renormalization scheme, we examine scheme
dependence when using the second way of summing logarithms. The renormalization
scheme invariants that arise are then related to those of Stevenson. We
consider two choices of renormalization scheme, one resulting in two powers of
a running coupling, the second in an infinite series in the two loop running
constant. We then establish how the coupling constant arising in one
renormalization scheme can be expressed as a power series of the coupling in
any other scheme. Next we establish how by using different mass scale at each
order of perturbation theory, all renormalization scheme dependence can be
absorbed into these mass scales when one uses the second way of summing
logarithmic corrections. We then employ this approach to renormalization scheme
dependency to the effective potential in a scalar model, showing the result
that it is independent of the background field is scheme independent. The way
in which the ""principle of minimal sensitivity"" can be applied after summation
is then discussed.

magnetic charge can also alter the space time structure, similar to
gravitational mass, giving rise to its effect on redshift. This can also be
considered as electro and magneto static redshift. Gravitational redshift has
been reported by most of the authors without consideration of static electric
and / or magnetic charges present in the rotating body. In the present paper,
we considered the three parameters: mass, rotation parameter and charge to
discuss their combined effect on redshift, for a charged rotating body by using
Kerr - Newman metric. It has been found that, the presence of electrostatic and
magnetostatic charge increases the value of so-called gravitational redshift.
Calculations have been also done here to determine the effect of electrostatic
and magnetostatic charges on the amount of redshift of a light ray emitted at
various latitudes from a charged rotating body. The variation of gravitational
redshift from equatorial to non- equatorial region has been calculated, for a
given set of values of electrostatic and magnetostatic charges.

related to the still unsolved problem of the structure of the dense core of
compact stars (CS): (i) the hyperon puzzle: how to reconcile pulsar masses of
$2\,$M$_\odot$ with the hyperon softening of the equation of state (EoS); (ii)
the masquerade problem: modern EoS for cold, high density hadronic and quark
matter are almost identical; and (iii) the reconfinement puzzle: what to do
when after a deconfinement transition the hadronic EoS becomes favorable again?
We show that taking into account the compositeness of baryons (by excluded
volume and/or quark Pauli blocking) on the hadronic side and confining and
stiffening effects on the quark matter side results in an early phase
transition to quark matter with sufficient stiffening at high densities which
removes all three present-day puzzles of CS interiors. Moreover, in this new
class of EoS for hybrid CS falls the interesting case of a strong first order
phase transition which results in the observable high mass twin star
phenomenon, an astrophysical observation of a critical endpoint in the QCD
phase diagram.

multi-body final states are an extension of our previous results to the case of
massive decay products and the factorization of the multi-body phase space. The
mass measurement strategy that we propose is distinct from alternative methods
because it does not require an accurate reconstruction of the entire event, as
it does not involve, for instance, the missing transverse momentum, but rather
requires measuring only the visible decay products of the decay of interest. To
demonstrate the general strategy, we study a supersymmetric model wherein
pair-produced gluinos each decay to a stable neutralino and a bottom
quark-antiquark pair via an off-shell bottom squark. The combinatorial
background stemming from the indistinguishable visible final states on both
decay sides can be treated by an ""event mixing"" technique, the performance of
which is discussed in detail. Taking into account dominant backgrounds, we are
able to show that the mass of the gluino and, in favorable cases, that of the
neutralino can be determined by this mass measurement strategy.

can give rise to singular points called exceptional points ($EP$'s), where two

non-diagonalizable. We show that for a generic $d$-dimensional topological
superconductor / superfluid with a chiral symmetry, one can find $EP$'s
associated with the chiral zero energy Majorana fermions bound to a topological
defect / edge. Exploiting the chiral symmetry, we propose a formula for
counting the number ($n$) of such chiral zero modes. We also establish the
connection of these solutions to the Majorana fermion wavefunctions in the
position space. The imaginary parts of these momenta are related to the
exponential decay of the wavefunctions localized at the defect / edge, and
hence their changes of signs at a topological phase transition point signal the
appearance or disappearance of chiral Majorana zero modes. Our analysis thus
explains why topological invariants like the winding number, defined for the
corresponding Hamiltonian in the momentum space for a defectless system with
periodic boundary conditions, capture the number of admissible Majorana fermion
solutions for the position space Hamiltonian with defect(s). Finally, we
conclude that $EP$'s cannot be associated with the Majorana fermion
wavefunctions for systems with no chiral symmetry, although one can use our
formula for counting $n$, using complex $k$ solutions where the determinant of
the corresponding BdG Hamiltonian vanishes.

selection pressures over evolutionary time scales have led to cortices that
have a large surface area to volume ratio in some organisms, with the result
that the brain is strongly convoluted into sulci and gyri. Here we show that
the gyrification can arise as a nonlinear consequence of a simple mechanical
instability driven by tangential expansion of the gray matter constrained by
the white matter. A physical mimic of the process using a layered swelling gel
captures the essence of the mechanism, and numerical simulations of the brain
treated as a soft solid lead to the formation of cusped sulci and smooth gyri
similar to those in the brain. The resulting gyrification patterns are a
function of relative cortical expansion and relative thickness (compared with
brain size), and are consistent with observations of a wide range of brains,
ranging from smooth to highly convoluted. Furthermore, this dependence on two
simple geometric parameters that characterize the brain also allows us to
qualitatively explain how variations in these parameters lead to anatomical
anomalies in such situations as polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and lissencephalia.

a constant struggle due to the High Weissenberg Number Problem. While the
stability for macroscopic descriptions could be greatly enhanced by the
log-conformation method as proposed by Fattal and Kupferman, the application of
the efficient Newton-Raphson algorithm to the full monolithic system of
governing equations, consisting of the log-conformation equations and the
Navier-Stokes equations, has always posed a problem. In particular, it is the
formulation of the constitutive equations by means of the spectral
decomposition that hinders the application of further analytical tools.
Therefore, up to now, a fully monolithic approach could only be achieved in two
dimensions, as, e.g., recently shown in [P. Knechtges, M. Behr, S. Elgeti,
Fully-implicit log-conformation formulation of constitutive laws, J.
Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 214 (2014) 78-87].
  The aim of this paper is to find a generalization of the previously made
considerations to three dimensions, such that a monolithic Newton-Raphson
solver based on the log-conformation formulation can be implemented also in
this case. The underlying idea is analogous to the two-dimensional case, to
replace the eigenvalue decomposition in the constitutive equation by an
analytically more ""well-behaved"" term and to rely on the eigenvalue
decomposition only for the actual computation. Furthermore, in order to
demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method, numerical results of the
newly derived formulation are presented in the case of the sedimenting sphere
and ellipsoid benchmarks for the Oldroyd-B and Giesekus models. It is found
that the expected quadratic convergence of Newton's method can be achieved.

cross indicates the location of the corotation radius. We then calculated the
relative bar pattern speed, $\mathcal{R}$, and classified the bar as ""fast"",

properties of two groups of RE pyrochlores, Ln2Zr2O7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) and
Gd2T2O7 (T = Zr, Hf, Sn, Pb) employing density functional theory and quasi
harmonic approximation. Through the relaxation time approximation (RTA) with
Debye model, the thermal conductivities of those RE pyrochlores were predicted,
showing good agreement with experimental measurements. The low thermal
conductivities of RE pyrochlores were shown to largely come from the
interference between the low-lying optical branches and acoustic branches. The
structural origin underlying the low-lying optical branches was then clarified
and the competition between scattering processes in transverse and longitude
acoustic branches was discussed.

planet formation scenarios. Analytical perturbation theory predicts the
existence of nested circumbinary orbits that are generalizations of circular
paths around a single star. These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned
with the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not
cross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large
planets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto
these ""most circular"" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside
a region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary
planets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star. Here,
we review the theory and confirm its predictions with a suite of representative
simulations. We then consider the circumbinary planets discovered with NASA's
Kepler satellite. These Neptune- and Jupiter-size planets, or their
planetesimal precursors, may have migrated inward to reach their observed
orbits, since their current positions are outside of unstable zones caused by
overlapping resonances. In situ formation without migration seems less likely,
only because the surface density of the protoplanetary disks must be
implausibly high. Otherwise, the circumbinary environment is friendly to planet
formation, and we expect that many Earth-like ""Tatooines"" will join the growing
census of circumbinary planets.

electric field exceeds a critical value. For such electrons with energies
typically reaching tens of MeV, the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) radiation
force, in reaction to the synchrotron emission, is significant and can be the
dominant process limiting the electron acceleration. The effect of the
ALD-force on runaway electron dynamics in a homogeneous plasma is investigated
using the relativistic finite-difference Fokker-Planck codes LUKE [Decker &
Peysson, Report EUR-CEA-FC-1736, Euratom-CEA, (2004)] and CODE [Landreman et
al, Comp. Phys. Comm. 185, 847 (2014)]. Under the action of the ALD force, we
find that a bump is formed in the tail of the electron distribution function if
the electric field is sufficiently large. We also observe that the energy of
runaway electrons in the bump increases with the electric field amplitude,
while the population increases with the bulk electron temperature. The presence
of the bump divides the electron distribution into a runaway beam and a bulk
population. This mechanism may give rise to beam-plasma types of instabilities
that could in turn pump energy from runaway electrons and alter their
confinement.

calculating collision probabilities, paying careful attention to the
non-uniform distribution of the perihelion longitude and the argument of
perihelion owed to secular planetary perturbations. We find that these
previously neglected non-uniformities have a significant effect on the mean
annual impact flux as well as its seasonal variation. The impact flux peaks
when Mars is at aphelion, but the near-alignment of Mars' eccentricity vector
with the mean direction of the eccentricity vectors of Mars-crossers causes the
mean annual impact flux as well as the amplitude of the seasonal variation to
be significantly lower than the estimate based on a uniform random distribution
of perihelion longitudes of Mars-crossers. We estimate that the flux of large
impactors (of absolute magnitude $H<16$) within $\pm30^\circ$ of Mars' aphelion
is about four times larger than when the planet is near perihelion.
Extrapolation of our results to a model population of meter-size Mars-crossers
shows that if these small impactors have a uniform distribution of their
angular elements, then their aphelion-to-perihelion impact flux ratio would be
as large as 25. These theoretical predictions can be tested with observational
data of contemporary impacts that is becoming available from spacecraft
currently in orbit about Mars.

Here, we present an analysis technique for single molecule tracking (SMT)
trajectories that can determine the preferred model of motion that best matches
observed trajectories. Information theory criteria, such as the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and
modified AIC (AICc), are used to select the preferred model. The considered
group of models includes free Brownian motion, and confined motion in 2nd or
4th order potentials. We determine the best information criteria for
classifying trajectories. We tested its limits through simulations matching
large sets of experimental conditions and built a decision tree. This decision
tree first uses the BIC to distinguish between free Brownian motion and
confined motion. In a second step, it classifies the confining potential
further using the AIC. We apply the method to experimental Clostridium
Perfingens epsilon-toxin (CPepsilonT) receptor trajectories to show that these
receptors are confined by a spring-like potential. An adaptation of this
technique was applied on a sliding window in the temporal dimension along the
trajectory. We applied this adaptation to experimental CPepsilonT trajectories
that lose confinement due to disaggregation of confining domains. This new
technique adds another dimension to the discussion of SMT data. The mode of
motion of a receptor holds more biologically relevant information than the
diffusion coefficient or domain size and may be a better tool to classify and
compare different SMT experiments.

high-energy collisions. Anisotropic gluon distributions lead to anisotropies of
the single-particle azimuthal distribution and hence to disconnected
contributions to multi-particle cumulants. When these dominate, the
four-particle elliptic anisotropy $c_2\{4\}$ changes sign. On the other hand,
connected diagrams for $m$-particle cumulants are found to quickly saturate
with increasing $m$, a ``coherence'' quite unlike conventional ``non-flow''
contributions such as decays. Finally, we perform a first exploratory
phenomenological analysis in order to estimate the amplitude ${\cal A}$ of the
$\cos(2\varphi)$ anisotropy of the gluon distribution at small $x$, and we
provide a qualitative prediction for the elliptic asymmetry from three-particle
correlations, $c_2\{3\}$.

fields, exceeding 4 x 10^13 G, exist on a subset of neutron stars. These
magnetars may harbor interior fields many orders of magnitude larger,
potentially reaching equipartition values. However, the impact of these strong
fields on stellar structure has been largely ignored, potentially complicating
attempts to infer the high density nuclear equation of state. Here we assess
the effect of these strong magnetic fields on the mass-radius relationship of
neutron stars. We employ an effective field theory model for the nuclear
equation of state that includes the impact of hyperons, anomalous magnetic
moments, and the physics of the crust. We consider two magnetic field
geometries, bounding the likely magnitude of the impact of magnetic fields: a
statistically isotropic, tangled field and a force-free configuration. In both
cases even equipartition fields have at most a 30% impact on the maximum mass.
However, the direction of the effect of the magnetic field depends on the
geometry employed - force-free fields leading to reductions in the maximum
neutron star mass and radius while tangled fields increase both - challenging
the common intuition in the literature on the impact of magnetic fields.

which include Multiway Cut, Node-weighted Multiway Cut, and Hypergraph Multiway

generalizations: as Min-CSPs, and as Submodular Multiway Partition problems.
These two generalizations lead to two natural relaxations, the Basic LP, and
the Lovasz relaxation. We show that the Lovasz relaxation gives a
(2-2/k)-approximation for Submodular Multiway Partition with $k$ terminals,
improving a recent 2-approximation. We prove that this factor is optimal in two
senses: (1) A (2-2/k-\epsilon)-approximation for Submodular Multiway Partition
with k terminals would require exponentially many value queries. (2) For
Hypergraph Multiway Cut and Node-weighted Multiway Cut with k terminals, both
special cases of Submodular Multiway Partition, we prove that a
(2-2/k-\epsilon)-approximation is NP-hard, assuming the Unique Games
Conjecture.
  Both our hardness results are more general: (1) We show that the notion of
symmetry gap, previously used for submodular maximization problems, also
implies hardness results for submodular minimization problems. (2) Assuming the
Unique Games Conjecture, we show that the Basic LP gives an optimal
approximation for every Min-CSP that includes the Not-Equal predicate.
  Finally, we connect the two hardness techniques by proving that the
integrality gap of the Basic LP coincides with the symmetry gap of the
multilinear relaxation (for a related instance). This shows that the appearance
of the same hardness threshold for a Min-CSP and the related submodular
minimization problem is not a coincidence.

sections and a field potential given by a mass term, although the formalism can
be extended to other topologies and potentials. The perturbations are described
in terms of Mukhanov-Sasaki gauge invariants, linear perturbative constraints,
and variables canonically conjugate to them. This set is completed into a
canonical one for the entire system, including the homogeneous degrees of
freedom. We find the global Hamiltonian constraint of the model, in which the
contribution of the homogeneous sector is corrected with a term quadratic in
the perturbations, that can be identified as the Mukhanov-Sasaki Hamiltonian in
our formulation. We then adopt a hybrid approach to quantize the model,
combining a quantum representation of the homogeneous sector with a more
standard field quantization of the perturbations. Covariance is guaranteed in
this approach inasmuch as no gauge fixing is adopted. Next, we adopt a
Born-Oppenheimer ansatz for physical states and show how to obtain a
Schr\""odinger-like equation for the quantum evolution of the perturbations.
This evolution is governed by the Mukhanov-Sasaki Hamiltonian, with the
dependence on the homogeneous geometry evaluated at quantum expectation values,
and with a time parameter defined also in terms of suitable expectation values
on that geometry. Finally, we derive effective equations for the dynamics of
the Mukhanov-Sasaki gauge invariants, that include quantum contributions, but

on boundaries at finite distance from the bulk -- is related to simple notions
of UV cutoffs in gauge/gravity duality and appears in discussions relating the
low-energy behavior of gravity to fluid dynamics. We study the Einstein-Maxwell
version of this problem, in which the induced Maxwell potential on the wall is
also fixed. For flat walls in otherwise-asymptotically-flat spacetimes, we
identify a moduli space of Majumdar-Papapetrou-like static solutions
parametrized by the location of an extreme black hole relative to the wall.
Such solutions may be described as balancing gravitational repulsion from a
negative-mass image-source against electrostatic attraction to an
oppositely-signed image charge. Standard techniques for handling divergences
yield a moduli space metric with an eigenvalue that becomes negative near the
wall, indicating a region of negative kinetic energy and suggesting that the
Hamiltonian may be unbounded below. One may also surround the black hole with
an additional (roughly spherical) Dirichlet wall to impose a regulator whose
physics is more clear. Negative kinetic energies remain, though new terms do
appear in the moduli-space metric. The regulator-dependence indicates that the

superintegrable systems with integrals of arbitrary order are connected with
Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials (EOP) of type I (or II) and
supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Moreover, we present an algebraic
derivation of the degenerate energy spectrum for the one- and two-parameter
Lissajous systems and the rationally extended models. These results are based
on finitely generated polynomial algebras, Casimir operators, realizations as
deformed oscillator algebras and finite-dimensional unitary representations.
Such results have only been established so far for 2D superintegrable systems
separable in Cartesian coordinates, which are related to a class of polynomial
algebras that display a simpler structure. We also point out how the structure
function of these deformed oscillator algebras is directly related with the
generalized Heisenberg algebras (GHA) spanned by the nonpolynomial integrals.

hospital environment and has suggested for collecting data and management from
different TPSs with DICOM objects. However, some TPS does not provide the DVH
exportation with text or other format. In addition, plan review systems for
various TPSs often allow DVH recalculation with different algorithms. These
algorithms result in the inevitable discrepancy between the values obtained
with the recalculation and those obtained with TPS itself. The purpose of this
study was to develop a simple method for generating reproducible DVH values
obtained from the TPSs. Treatment planning information including structures and
delivered dose was exported by the DICOM format from planning systems. The
supersampling and trilinear interpolation methods were employed to calculate
DVH data from 35 treatment plans. The discrepancies between DVHs extracted from
each TPS and the proposed calculation method were evaluated with respect to the
supersampling ratio. The volume, minimum dose, maximum dose, and mean dose were
compared. The variation of DVHs from multiple TPSs was compared with a
commercially available treatment planning comparison tool. The overall
comparisons of the volume, minimum dose, maximum dose, and mean dose showed
that the proposed method generated relatively smaller discrepancies compared
with TPS than those by MIM software and TPS. As the structure volume decreased,
the overall percent difference increased. Most large difference was observed in
the small organs such as eye ball, lens, optic nerve which had below 10 cc
volume. A simple and useful technique was developed to generate DVH with
acceptable error from a proprietary TPS. This study provides the convenient and
common framework which allows to use a single well-managed storage solution for
the independent information system.

using the feature of the bag-of-words which is calculated using the term

single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SF-SRS) based on the clinical data
with the two different mask-creation methods using pretreatment CBCT imaging
guidance. Dedicated frameless fixation BrainLAB masks for 23 patients were
created as a routine mask (R-mask) making method, as explained in the BrainLAB
user manual. The alternative masks (A-mask) which were created by modifying the
cover range of the R-mask for the patient head were used for 23 patients. The
systematic errors including the each mask and stereotactic target localizer
were analyzed and the errors were calculated as the mean and standard deviation
(SD) from the LR, SI, AP, and yaw setup corrections. In addition, the frequency
of three-dimensional (3D) vector length were also analyzed. The values of the
mean setup corrections for the R-mask in all directions were small; < 0.7 mm
and < 0.1 degree, whereas the magnitudes of the SDs were relatively large
compared to the mean values. In contrast to the R-mask, the means and SDs of
the A-mask were smaller than those for the R-mask with the exception of the SD
in the AP direction. The mean and SD in the yaw rotational direction in the
R-mask and A-mask system were comparable. The 3D vector shifts of a larger
magnitude occurred more frequently for the R-mask than the A-mask. The setup
uncertainties for each mask with the stereotactic localizing system had an
asymmetric offset towards the positive AP direction. The A-mask-creation
method, which is capable of covering the top of the patient head is superior to
that for R-mask, and thereby the use of the A-mask is encouraged for SF-SRS to
reduce the setup uncertainties. Moreover, the careful mask making is required
to prevent the possible setup uncertainties.

a constant fraction of the total enclosed mass. We present evidence from
Rhapsody-G hydrodynamic simulations of massive galaxy clusters that the
closed-box expectation may hold to a surprising degree within the interior,
non-linear regions of haloes. At a fixed halo mass, we find a significant
anti-correlation between hot gas mass fraction and galaxy mass fraction (cold
gas + stars), with a rank correlation coefficient of -0.69 within $R_{500c}$.
Because of this anti-correlation, the total baryon mass serves as a low-scatter
proxy for total cluster mass. The fractional scatter of total baryon fraction
scales approximately as $0.02 (\Delta_c/100)^{0.6}$, while the scatter of
either gas mass or stellar mass is larger in magnitude and declines more slowly
with increasing radius. We discuss potential observational tests using cluster
samples selected by optical and hot gas properties; the simulations suggest
that joint selection on stellar and hot gas has potential to achieve 5% scatter

instability mitigation is rather robust against changes in the phase, the
amplitude and the wavelength of the wobbling perturbation applied. Generally
instability would emerge from the perturbation of the physical quantity.
Normally the perturbation phase is unknown so that the instability growth rate
is discussed. However, if the perturbation phase is known, the instability
growth can be controlled by a superposition of perturbations imposed actively:
if the perturbation is induced by, for example, a driving beam axis oscillation
or wobbling, the perturbation phase could be controlled and the instability
growth is mitigated by the superposition of the growing perturbations.

Calzetti curve is needed to reproduce the observed IR/UV ratios of galaxies
younger than 100 Myr. Furthermore, using the bolometric star-formation rate
inferred from the UV and mid-IR data (SFR$_{IR}$+SFR$_{UV}$), we calculated the
conversion between the H$\alpha$ luminosity and SFR to be $(7.5\pm1.3) \times
10^{-42}$ for a Salpeter IMF, which is consistent with the Kennicutt (1998)
conversion. The derived conversion factor is independent of any assumption of

units (MUs) and gantry angle position accuracy and the standard deviations of
MU (sigma_MU; dosimetric error) and gantry angle (sigma_GA; geometric error)
are displayed on the console monitor after completion of the RapidArc delivery.
In the present study, first, the log data was analyzed to confirm its validity
and usability; then, statistical process control (SPC) was applied to monitor
the sigma_MU and sigma_GA in a timely manner for all RapidArc fields: a total
of 195 arc fields for 99 patients. The sigma_MU and sigma_GA were determined
twice for all fields, that is, first during the patient-specific plan QA and
then again during the first treatment. The sigma_MU and sigma_GA time series
were quite stable irrespective of the treatment site; however, the sigma_GA was
strongly dependent on the gantry rotation speed. The sigma_GA of the RapidArc
delivery for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was smaller than that
for the typical VMAT. Therefore, SPC was applied for SBRT cases and general
cases respectively. Moreover, the accuracy of the potential meter of gantry
rotation is important, since the sigma_GA can be dramatically changed due to
its condition. By applying SPC to the sigma_MU and sigma_GA, we could monitor
the delivery error efficiently. However, the upper and lower limits of SPC need
to be determined carefully with full knowledge of the machine and log data.

curvature slicing with conformally flat spatial coordinates and asymptotic
quasihomogeneous solutions in the comoving gauge and compare the numerical
results of PBH formation in these two different approaches. To discuss the PBH
formation, it is convenient and conventional to use $\tilde{\delta}_{c}$, the
value which the averaged density perturbation at threshold in the comoving
slicing would take at horizon entry in the lowest-order long-wavelength
expansion. We numerically find that within compensated models, the sharper the
transition from the overdense region to the FRW universe is, the larger the

the maximum $\tilde{\delta}_{c, {\rm max}}\simeq 3\Gamma/(3\Gamma+2)$. As for
the threshold peak value of the curvature variable $\psi_{0,c}$, we find that

obtained by the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) method. In this
paper, we analyze their regularizing effects and establish the following
results: (i) the filtered SVD expression are derived for the regularized
solutions by MINRES; (ii) a hybrid MINRES that uses explicit regularization
within projected problems is needed to compute a best possible regularized
solution to a given ill-posed problem; (iii) the $k$th iterate by MINRES is
more accurate than the $(k-1)$th iterate by MR-II until the semi-convergence of
MINRES, but MR-II has globally better regularizing effects than MINRES; (iv)
bounds are obtained for the 2-norm distance between an underlying
$k$-dimensional Krylov subspace and the $k$-dimensional dominant eigenspace.
They show that MR-II has better regularizing effects for severely and
moderately ill-posed problems than for mildly ill-posed problems, and a hybrid
MR-II is needed to get a best possible regularized solution for mildly
ill-posed problems; (v) bounds are derived for the entries generated by the
symmetric Lanczos process that MR-II is based on, showing how fast they decay.
Numerical experiments confirm our assertions. Stronger than our theory, the
regularizing effects of MR-II are experimentally shown to be good enough to
obtain best possible regularized solutions for severely and moderately
ill-posed problems.

direction-sensitive detector would provide decisive evidence for the discovery
of galactic dark matter. Directional information would also provide a crucial
input to understanding its distribution in the local Universe. Most of the
existing directional dark matter detectors utilize particle tracking methods in
a low-pressure gas time projection chamber. These low pressure detectors
require excessively large volumes in order to be competitive in the search for
physics beyond the current limit. In order to avoid these volume limitations,
we consider a novel proposal, which exploits a columnar recombination effect in
a high-pressure gas time projection chamber. The ratio of scintillation to
ionization signals observed in the detector carries the angular information of
the particle interactions. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of a
future directional detector focused on the proposed high-pressure Xenon gas
time projection chamber. We study the prospect of detecting an anisotropy in
the dark matter velocity distribution. We find that tens of events are needed
to exclude an isotropic distribution of dark matter interactions at 95%
confidence level in the most optimistic case with head-to-tail information.
However, one needs at least 10-20 times more events without head-to-tail
information for light dark matter below 50 GeV. For an intermediate mass range,
we find it challenging to observe an anisotropy of the dark matter
distribution. Our results also show that the directional information
significantly improves precision measurements of dark matter mass and the
elastic scattering cross section for a heavy dark matter.

re-acceleration in the halo is supplied by shocks generated by processes of
star accretion onto the central black hole. Numerical simulations show that
regions with strong turbulence (places for electron re-acceleration) are
located high up in the Galactic Halo about several kpc above the disk. The
energy of SNR electrons that reach these regions does not exceed several GeV
because of synchrotron and inverse Compton energy losses. At appropriate
parameters of re-acceleration these electrons can be re-accelerated up to the
energy 10E12 eV which explains in this model the origin of the observed radio
and gamma-ray emission from the FB. However although the model gamma-ray
spectrum is consistent with the Fermi results, the model radio spectrum is
steeper than the observed by WMAP and Planck. If adiabatic losses due to plasma
outflow from the Galactic central regions are taken into account, then the
re-acceleration model nicely reproduces the Planck datapoints.

the tip of the iceberg. We present a suite of new attacks, called Raptor, that
can be launched by Autonomous Systems (ASes) to compromise user anonymity.
First, AS-level adversaries can exploit the asymmetric nature of Internet
routing to increase the chance of observing at least one direction of user
traffic at both ends of the communication. Second, AS-level adversaries can
exploit natural churn in Internet routing to lie on the BGP paths for more
users over time. Third, strategic adversaries can manipulate Internet routing
via BGP hijacks (to discover the users using specific Tor guard nodes) and
interceptions (to perform traffic analysis). We demonstrate the feasibility of
Raptor attacks by analyzing historical BGP data and Traceroute data as well as
performing real-world attacks on the live Tor network, while ensuring that we
do not harm real users. In addition, we outline the design of two monitoring
frameworks to counter these attacks: BGP monitoring to detect control-plane

symmetry-invariants of strain/stress. Symmetry-invariants allow obtaining an
accurate parametrization with a minimal number of coefficients. Based on this
limit surface, we deduce a general continuum criterion for the onset of all

magnitude of the deviatoric strain $\gamma$ reaches a critical value $\gamma^c$
which depends upon the mean hydrostatic strain $\bar {\mathcal E}$ and the
directionality $\theta$ of the deviatoric stretch. We also distinguish between
the distinct regions of the limit surface that correspond to
fundamentally-different mechanisms of lattice instabilities in graphene, such
as structural vs material instabilities, and long-wave (elastic) vs short-wave
instabilities. Utility of this limit surface is demonstrated in assessment of
incipient failures in defect-free graphene via its implementation in a

skyrmion lattices parallel to the {100} atomic lattices are directly observed

last decade, it has become a widely-accepted hypothesis that $L_s$ is

reach the wind speed (the ``drag length''). Here we challenge this hypothesis.
From extensive numerical Discrete Element Method simulations, we find that, for
medium and strong winds, $L_s\propto V_s^2/g$, where $V_s$ is the saturated
value of the average speed of sand particles traveling above the surface and

modeling of massively parallel numerical algorithms as switched dynamical

technique has the great potential to meet such a requirement by allowing
un-licensed users to coexist in licensed bands. In conventional CR systems, the
spectrum sensing is performed at the beginning of each time slot before the
data transmission. This unfortunately results in two major problems: 1)
transmission time reduction due to sensing, and 2) sensing accuracy impairment
due to data transmission. To tackle these problems, in this paper we present a
new design paradigm for future CR by exploring the full-duplex (FD) techniques
to achieve the simultaneous spectrum sensing and data transmission. With FD
radios equipped at the secondary users (SUs), SUs can simultaneously sense and
access the vacant spectrum, and thus, significantly improve sensing
performances and meanwhile increase data transmission efficiency. The aim of
this article is to transform the promising conceptual framework into the
practical wireless network design by addressing a diverse set of challenges
such as protocol design and theoretical analysis. Several application scenarios

numerical experiments in different dimensions and coordinate systems are
conducted to demonstrate the excellent performance of POSS regarding low

complexity of the method when dealing with the convection of charged particles
increases linearly with the number of unknowns. For the simulation of corona

features enable POSS to have great potential in modeling of corona discharges
in long interelectrode gaps and for long simulation times.

broken TRS is signaled by the onset of a spontaneous static local magnetic

$B_s$ decreases linearly with $x$ and $\to 0$ at $x \approx 0.4$, close to the
concentration above which superconductivity is no longer observed. The
(Pr,Ce)Pt$_4$Ge$_{12}$ and isostructural (Pr,La)Os$_4$Sb$_{12}$ alloy series
both exhibit superconductivity with broken TRS, and in both the decrease of
$B_s$ is proportional to the decrease of Pr concentration. This suggests that
Pr-Pr intersite interactions are responsible for the broken TRS\@. The two
alloy series differ in that the La-doped alloys are superconducting for all La
concentrations, suggesting that in (Pr,Ce)Pt$_4$Ge$_{12}$ pair-breaking by Ce
doping suppresses superconductivity. For all $x$ the dynamic muon spin
relaxation rate decreases somewhat in the superconducting state. This may be
due to Korringa relaxation by conduction electrons, which is reduced by the

practice to integrate the collected information, where the accuracy of the

diagnostic test, the Youden index has been widely used in literature. Various
parametric and nonparametric methods have been proposed to linearly combine

paper proposes a flexible approach that allows both linear and nonlinear
combinations of biomarkers. The proposed approach formulates the problem in a
large margin classification framework, where the combination function is

(photo-z), age and spectral type for photometric data sample by fitting

interactions have no effect on photo-z estimation. Once we neglect binary
interactions, the age of ETGs will be underestimated, by contrast, the effects
on the age estimations can be negligible for other type of galaxies. For ETG
sample, we derive their properties by fitting their spectra with the SSP and
BSP models. When comparing these galaxy properties, we find no variation of the
overall metallicities for ETGs among the SSP and BSP models. Moreover, the
inclusion of binary interactions can affect age estimations. Our results show
that the BSP-fitted ages in ~33.3% of ETG sample are around 0.5-1.0 Gyr larger
than the SSP-fitted ages; ~44.2\% are only 0.1-0.5 Gyr larger; the rest ~22.5%
are approximately equal. By comparisons, we find the difference of the star

  with biochemical pathway",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kinetic-transport equations are, by now, standard models to describe the
dynamics of populations of bacteria moving by run-and-tumble. Experimental
observations show that bacteria increase their run duration when encountering
an increasing gradient of chemotactic molecules. This led to a first class of
models which heuristically include tumbling frequencies depending on the
path-wise gradient of chemotactic signal.
  More recently, the biochemical pathways regulating the flagellar motors were
uncovered. This knowledge gave rise to a second class of kinetic-transport
equations, that takes into account an intra-cellular molecular content and
which relates the tumbling frequency to this information. It turns out that the
tumbling frequency depends on the chemotactic signal, and not on its gradient.
  For these two classes of models, macroscopic equations of Keller-Segel type,
have been derived using diffusion or hyperbolic rescaling. We complete this
program by showing how the first class of equations can be derived from the
second class with molecular content after appropriate rescaling. The main
difficulty is to explain why the path-wise gradient of chemotactic signal can
arise in this asymptotic process.
  Randomness of receptor methylation events can be included, and our approach
can be used to compute the tumbling frequency in presence of such a noise.

post-AGB binary and RV Tauri pulsator AC Her. We want to constrain the spatial
distribution of the amorphous as well as of the crystalline dust. We present
very high-quality mid-IR interferometric data that were obtained with
MIDI/VLTI. We analyse the MIDI data and the full SED, using the MCMax radiative
transfer code, to find a good structure model of AC Her's circumbinary disk. We
include a grain size distribution and midplane settling of dust
self-consistently. The spatial distribution of crystalline forsterite in the
disk is investigated with the mid-IR features, the 69~$\mu$m band and the
11.3~$\mu$m signatures in the interferometric data. All the data are well
fitted. The inclination and position angle of the disk are well determined at
i=50+-8 and PA=305+-10. We firmly establish that the inner disk radius is about
an order of magnitude larger than the dust sublimation radius. Significant
grain growth has occurred, with mm-sized grains being settled to the midplane
of the disk. A large dust mass is needed to fit the sub-mm fluxes. By assuming
{\alpha}=0.01, a good fit is obtained with a small grain size power law index
of 3.25, combined with a small gas/dust ratio <10. The resulting gas mass is
compatible with recent estimates employing direct gas diagnostics. The spatial
distribution of the forsterite is different from the amorphous dust, as more
warm forsterite is needed in the surface layers of the inner disk. The disk in
AC Her is very evolved, with its small gas/dust ratio and large inner hole.
Mid-IR interferometry offers unique constraints, complementary to mid-IR
features, for studying the mineralogy in disks. A better uv coverage is needed
to constrain in detail the distribution of the crystalline forsterite in AC
Her, but we find strong similarities with the protoplanetary disk HD100546.

$n_{rf}=n_t$, respectively. In GSM, in addition to conveying information bits
through $n_{rf}$ conventional modulation symbols (for example, QAM), the
indices of the $n_{rf}$ active transmit antennas also convey information bits.
In this paper, we investigate {\em GSM for large-scale multiuser MIMO

an average bit error probability (ABEP) analysis for maximum-likelihood
detection in multiuser GSM-MIMO on the uplink, where we derive an upper bound
on the ABEP, and ($ii$) low-complexity algorithms for GSM-MIMO signal detection
and channel estimation at the base station receiver based on message passing.
The analytical upper bounds on the ABEP are found to be tight at moderate to
high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The proposed receiver algorithms are found
to scale very well in complexity while achieving near-optimal performance in
large dimensions. Simulation results show that, for the same spectral
efficiency, multiuser GSM-MIMO can outperform multiuser SM-MIMO as well as
conventional multiuser MIMO, by about 2 to 9 dB at a bit error rate of
$10^{-3}$. Such SNR gains in GSM-MIMO compared to SM-MIMO and conventional MIMO
can be attributed to the fact that, because of a larger number of spatial index
bits, GSM-MIMO can use a lower-order QAM alphabet which is more power
efficient.

between two components is localized around density depressions in
quasi-one-dimensional systems. When the relative velocity is sufficiently
small, the periodic pattern reduces to a periodic array of topological solitons
as kinks of relative phase. According to our variational and numerical
analyses, the soliton solution is well characterized by the soliton width and
density depression. We demonstrate the dependence of the depression and width
on the Rabi frequency and the coupling constant of inter-component
density-density interactions. The periodic pattern of the relative phase
transforms continuously from a soliton array to a sinusoidal pattern as the
period becomes smaller than the soliton width. These patterns become unstable
when the localized relative velocity exceeds a critical value. The

unique) features: it is in principle computable, and non-trivial lower bounds
can be obtained, hence identifying truly complex states. In this paper, we
first review the definition of tree size, together with known results on the
most complex three and four qubits states. Moving to the multiqubit case, we
revisit a mathematical theorem for proving a lower bound on tree size that
scales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. Next, states with
superpolynomial tree size, the Immanant states, the Deutsch-Jozsa states, the
Shor's states and the subgroup states, are described. We show that the
universal resource state for measurement based quantum computation, the
2D-cluster state, has superpolynomial tree size. Moreover, we show how the
complexity of subgroup states and the 2D cluster state can be verified
efficiently. The question of how tree size is related to the speed up achieved
in quantum computation is also addressed. We show that superpolynomial tree
size of the resource state is essential for measurement based quantum
computation. The necessary role of large tree size in the circuit model of

An event in Euclidean space is extreme if it occurs far away from the origin.
We use a regular variation condition on the underlying stationary sequence to
make these notions precise. Our main result is a functional central limit
theorem for the integrated periodogram of the indicator functions of dependent
extremal events. The limiting process is a continuous Gaussian process whose
covari- ance structure is in general unfamiliar, but in the iid case a Brownian
bridge appears. In the general case, we propose a stationary bootstrap

developed theory can be used to construct classical goodness-of-fit tests such

only on the extremes in the sample. We apply the test statistics to simulated

positive constant independent of $n$ (depending only on $\psi$). A key
ingredient in the proof is a new operator inequality for the ground space

higher or lower field dependent on whether the field is rotated towards the
[100] or [010] direction. We use this latter observation to argue that the
Fermi surface morphology must play a key role in the mechanisms that drive the
VL structure transitions. Furthermore, we show this interpretation is
compatible with analogous results obtained previously on lightly overdoped
YBa2Cu3O7. In that material, it has long-been suggested that the high field VL
structure transition is driven by the nodal gap anisotropy. In contrast, the
results and discussion presented here bring into question the role, if any, of
a nodal gap anisotropy on the VL structure transitions in both YBa2Cu3O6.85 and
YBa2Cu3O7.

the rotation curve (RC) of this galaxy in terms of different profiles of its DM
distribution: the universal rotation curve (URC) mass model (stellar disk $+$
Burkert halo $+$ gaseous disk), the NFW mass model (stellar disk $+$ NFW halo
$+$ gaseous disk) and the baryon $\Lambda$CDM mass model (stellar disk $+$ NFW
halo modified by baryonic physics $+$ gaseous disk). Second, to derive the DM
halo density distribution, we applied a new method that does not require a
global and often uncertain mass modelling. While according to the standard
method, both URC and NFW mass models can account for the RC, the new method
instead leads to a density profile that is sharply disagrees with the dark halo
density distribution predicted within the Lambda cold dark matter
($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. We find that the effects of baryonic physics modify
the original $\Lambda$CDM halo densities in such a way that the resulting
profile is more compatible with the DM density of NGC 3198 derived using our
new method. However, at large distances, r $\sim$ 25 kpc, also this modified

catalog provides positions, soft fluxes, and, when possible, optical

We consider the fields with Galactic latitude |b| > 20 degree to avoid high HI
column densities. We discard all of the observations targeted at groups or
clusters of galaxies, as well as particular extragalactic fields not suitable
to search for faint extended sources. We finally select ~3000 useful fields
covering a total solid angle of ~400 degree^2. We identify extended source
candidates in the soft-band (0.5-2keV) images of these fields using the
software EXSdetect, which is specifically calibrated for the XRT data.
Extensive simulations are used to evaluate contamination and completeness as a
function of the source signal, allowing us to minimize the number of spurious
detections and to robustly assess the selection function. Our catalog includes
263 candidate galaxy clusters and groups down to a flux limit of 7E-15
erg/cm^2/s in the soft band, and the logN-logS is in very good agreement with
previous deep X-ray surveys. The final list of sources is cross-correlated with
published optical, X-ray, and SZ catalogs of clusters. We find that 137 sources
have been previously identified as clusters, while 126 are new detections.
Currently, we have collected redshift information for 158 sources (60% of the
entire sample). Once the optical follow-up and the X-ray spectral analysis of
the sources are complete, the SWXCS will provide a large and well-defined
catalog of groups and clusters of galaxies to perform statistical studies of
cluster properties and tests of cosmological models.

optimal redundancy in this scenario, we describe each vulnerability as a color

color-avoiding connectivity. We present algorithms for color-avoiding
percolation of general networks and an analytic theory for random graphs with
uniformly distributed colors including critical phenomena. We demonstrate our
theory by uncovering the hidden color-avoiding connectivity of the Internet. We

risk. Here we present a systematic method to alleviate this issue and obtain a
better estimation of the risk in the context of epidemic models informed by
high-resolution time-resolved contact data. We consider several such data sets
collected in various contexts and perform controlled resampling experiments. We
show how the statistical information contained in the resampled data can be
used to build a series of surrogate versions of the unknown contacts. We
simulate epidemic processes on the resulting reconstructed data sets and show
that it is possible to obtain good estimates of the outcome of simulations
performed using the complete data set. We discuss limitations and potential
improvements of our method.

neurons, their migration and the subsequent growth of axons and dendrites. Each
stage occurs within a certain period of time depending on types of neurons and
cortical layers. Forming synapses between neurons either by growing axons
starting at similar times for all neurons (much-overlapped time windows) or at
different time points (less-overlapped) may affect the topological and spatial
properties of neuronal networks. Here, we explore the extreme cases of axon
formation especially concerning short-distance connectivity during early
development, either starting at the same time for all neurons (parallel, i.e.
maximally-overlapped time windows) or occurring for each neuron separately one
neuron after another (serial, i.e. no overlaps in time windows). For both
cases, the number of potential and established synapses remained comparable.
Topological and spatial properties, however, differed: neurons that started
axon growth early on in serial growth achieved higher out-degrees, higher local
efficiency, and longer axon lengths while neurons demonstrated more homogeneous
connectivity patterns for parallel growth. Second, connection probability
decreased more rapidly with distance between neurons for parallel growth than
for serial growth. Third, bidirectional connections were more numerous for
parallel growth. Finally, we tested our predictions with C. elegans data.
Together, this indicates that time windows for axon growth influence the
topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks opening the possibility
to a posteriori estimate developmental mechanisms based on network properties
of a developed network.

enhancement is seen in the effective mass $m^{*}$ as the composition approaches
the value that has been associated with a quantum critical point at optimum

concentration $n_\mathrm{s}$ maintains the superfluid density, yielding an
apparent penetration depth $\lambda$ that decreases with increasing

rise to a virial equilibrium state which is far from spherically symmetric, and
typically triaxial. We focus here on how the degree of symmetry breaking in the
final state depends on the initial density profile. We note that the most
asymmetric structures result when, during the collapse phase, there is a strong
injection of energy preferentially into the particles which are localized
initially in the outer shells. These particles are still collapsing when the
others, initially located in the inner part, are already re-expanding; the
motion of particles in a time varying potential allow them to gain kinetic
energy --- in some cases enough to be ejected from the system. We show that
this mechanism of energy gain amplifies the initial small deviations from
perfect spherical symmetry due to finite $N$ fluctuations. This amplification
is more efficient when the initial density profile depends on radius, because
particles have a greater spread of fall times compared to a uniform density
profile, for which very close to symmetric final states are obtained}. These
effects lead to a distinctive correlation of the orientation of the final
structure with the distribution of ejected mass, and also with the initial
(very small) angular fluctuations.

based on renewable energy, planning can benefit from incorporating forecasts
about the uncertainty and from systematically evaluating the utility of the
forecast information. We consider these issues in a planning framework in which
forecasts are interpreted as constraints on the possible probability
distributions that the uncertain quantity of interest may have. The planning
goal is to robustly maximize the expected value of a given utility function,
integrated with respect to the worst-case distribution consistent with the
forecasts. Under mild technical assumptions we show that the problem can be
reformulated into convex optimization. We exploit this reformulation to
evaluate how informative the forecasts are in determining the optimal planning
decision, as well as to guide how forecasts can be appropriately refined to
obtain higher utility values. A numerical example of wind energy trading in
electricity markets illustrates our results.

Jupiter's atmosphere using the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS).
These spectra contain a strong absorption at wavelengths from about 2.9 $\mu$m
to 3.1 $\mu$m, previously noticed in a 3-$\mu$m spectrum obtained by the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in 1996. While Brooke et al. (1998, Icarus
136, 1-13) were able to fit the ISO spectrum very well using ammonia ice as the
sole source of particulate absorption, Sromovsky and Fry (2010, Icarus 210,
211-229), using significantly revised NH$_3$ gas absorption models, showed that
ammonium hydrosulfide (NH$_4$SH) provided a better fit to the ISO spectrum than
NH$_3$ , but that the best fit was obtained when both NH$_3$ and NH$_4$SH were
present. Although the large FOV of the ISO instrument precluded identification
of the spatial distribution of these two components, the VIMS spectra at low
and intermediate phase angles show that 3-$\mu$m absorption is present in zones
and belts, in every region investigated, and both low- and high-opacity samples
are best fit with a combination of NH$_4$SH and NH$_3$ particles at all
locations. The best fits are obtained with a layer of small ammonia-coated
particles ($r\sim0.3$ $\mu$m) overlying but often close to an optically thicker
but still modest layer of much larger NH$_4$SH particles ($r\sim 10$ $\mu$m),
with a deeper optically thicker layer, which might also be composed of
NH$_4$SH. Although these fits put NH$_3$ ice at pressures less than 500 mb,
this is not inconsistent with the lack of prominent NH$_3$ features in
Jupiter's longwave spectrum because the reflectivity of the core particles
strongly suppresses the NH$_3$ absorption features, at both near-IR and thermal

Our goal is to determine the molecular composition of the circumstellar
disk around AB Aurigae (hereafter, AB Aur). AB Aur is a prototypical Herbig Ae
star and the understanding of its disk chemistry is of paramount importance to
understand the chemical evolution of the gas in warm disks. Methods. We used
the IRAM 30-m telescope to perform a sensitive search for molecular lines in AB
Aur as part of the IRAM Large program ASAI (A Chemical Survey of Sun-like
Star-forming Regions). These data were complemented with interferometric
observations of the HCO+ 1-0 and C17O 1-0 lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer (PdBI). Single-dish and interferometric data were used to
constrain chemical models. Results. Throughout the survey, several lines of CO
and its isotopologues, HCO+, H2CO, HCN, CN and CS, were detected. In addition,
we detected the SO 54-33 and 56-45 lines, confirming the previous tentative
detection. Comparing to other T Tauri's and Herbig Ae disks, AB Aur presents
low HCN 3-2/HCO+ 3-2 and CN 2-1/HCN 3-2 line intensity ratios, similar to other
transition disks. AB Aur is the only protoplanetary disk detected in SO thus
far. Conclusions. We modeled the line profiles using a chemical model and a
radiative transfer 3D code. Our model assumes a flared disk in hydrostatic
equilibrium. The best agreement with observations was obtained for a disk with
a mass of 0.01 Msun , Rin=110 AU, Rout=550 AU, a surface density radial index
of 1.5 and an inclination of 27 deg. The intensities and line profiles were
reproduced within a factor of 2 for most lines. This agreement is reasonable
taking into account the simplicity of our model that neglects any structure
within the disk. However, the HCN 3-2 and CN 2-1 line intensities were
predicted more intense by a factor of >10. We discuss several scenarios to
explain this discrepancy.

that the measured equation of state, $w_{de}$, is in reality an effective one,

been shown that the path integral formalism can be built from the real motion

introduces in hamiltonians the partial time derivative of an arbitrary

sensitivity of permalloy (Py:Ni81Fe19) onto paper substrates. In this work, we
report on our findings with clean room paper (80 g/m2, Rrms = 2.877 {\mu}m, 23%
surface porosity, latex impregnation, no embossed macro-structure). Here, the
Py:Ni81Fe19 coating was manufactured by means of a dry process, sputter
deposition, and spans an area of 10x10 mm2 and a thickness of 70 nm. Employing
a four-point-probe DC resistivity measurement setup, we investigated the change
of electrical resistance of Py:Ni81Fe19 under the presence of an oriented
external magnetic field. In particular, we investigate the magneto-resistive
change at two configurations: (1) the direction of the magnetic field is
parallel to the nominal induced electric current and (2) the direction of the
magnetic field is perpendicular to the electric current. Due to the stochastic
orientation of the fibers interplaying with the Py:Ni81Fe19 coating, the change
in magneto-resistance of the overall system at both measurement configurations
closely corresponds to the classical response of Py:Ni81Fe19 at a +/-45{\deg}
angle between the direction of electrical current and magnetic field. Using the
magneto-optic kerr effect, we observed the formation of domain walls at the
fiber bending locations. Future work will focus on the impact of layer
thickness, fiber dimensions and structure of magnetic coating on the
performance of the paper-based Py:Ni81Fe19 magneto-resistors.

The latest major outbreak occurred in Guinea, Sierra Leonne and Liberia in
2014. With the aim of understanding the spread of infection in the affected
countries, it is crucial to modelize the virus and simulate it. In this paper,
we begin by studying a simple mathematical model that describes the 2014 Ebola
outbreak in Liberia. Then, we use numerical simulations and available data
provided by the World Health Organization to validate the obtained mathematical
model. Moreover, we develop a new mathematical model including vaccination of
individuals. We discuss different cases of vaccination in order to predict the
effect of vaccination on the infected individuals over time. Finally, we apply
optimal control to study the impact of vaccination on the spread of the Ebola
virus. The optimal control problem is solved numerically by using a direct
multi-shooting method.

study of the contraction spaces in
