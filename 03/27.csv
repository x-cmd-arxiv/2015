to compute $J/\psi$ production in deuteron-nucleus collisions at RHIC and
proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC. Our results match smoothly at high
$p_\perp$ to a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD + NRQCD computation.
Excellent agreement is obtained for $p_\perp$ spectra at RHIC and LHC for
central and forward rapidities, as well as for the normalized ratio $R_{pA}$ of
these results to spectra in proton-proton collisions. In particular, we observe
that the $R_{pA}$ data is strongly bounded by our computations of the same for
each of the individual NRQCD channels; this result provides strong evidence
that our description is robust against uncertainties in initial conditions and
hadronization mechanisms.

present here the results of numerical modeling of an ion-acoustic collisionless
shock based on one-dimensional (1D) kinetic approximation both for electrons

randomly coupled atoms in a two-dimensional optical lattice. By choosing
appropriate real or complex-valued random fields and species-dependent energy
offsets, this system can be used to analyze effects of disorder in four
different classes: The chiral BDI and AIII, and the A and AI symmetry classes.
These chiral classes are known to support a metallic phase at zero energy,
which here, due to the inevitable finite size of the system, should also
persist in a neighborhood of non-zero energies. As we discuss, this is of
particular interest for experiments involving quenches. Away from the centre of
the spectrum, we find that excitations appear as domain walls in the cases with
time-reversal symmetry, or as vortices in the cases where time-reversal
symmetry is absent. Therefore, a quench in a system with uniform density would
lead to the formation of either vortices or domain walls depending on the
symmetry class. For the non-chiral models in the A and AI classes, a population
imbalance between the two atomic species naturally occurs. In these cases, one
of the two species is seen to favour a more uniform density. We also study the
onset of localization as the disorder strength is increased for the different
classes, and by deriving an effective model for the non-chiral cases we show
how their eigenstates remain extended for larger values of the coupling with
the disorder, if compared to the non-chiral ones.

study the superconducting and magnetic properties of Nb2PdS5. Zero-field muSR
data show that no sizeable spontaneous magnetization arises with the onset of
superconductivity in Nb2PdS5 which indicates that the time reversal symmetry is
probably preserved in the superconducting state of this system. A strong
diamagnetic shift is observed in the transverse-field muSR data practically
ruling out a dominant triplet-pairing superconducting state in Nb2PdS5. The
temperature dependence of magnetic penetration depth evidences the existence of
a single s-wave energy gap with a gap value of 1.07(4) meV at zero temperature.
The gap to Tc ratio, 2.02(9), indicates that Nb2PdS5 should be considered as a
moderately strong-coupling superconductor. The magnetic penetration depth at
zero temperature is 785(20) nm, indicating a very low superfluid density
consistent with the quasi-one-dimensional nature of this system.

level of robustness and generality necessary to work reliably in the real
world. Even the most powerful convolutional neural network we can train fails
to perform satisfactorily when trained and tested on data from different
databases. This issue, known as domain adaptation and/or dataset bias in the
literature, is due to a distribution mismatch between data collections. Methods
addressing it go from max-margin classifiers to learning how to modify the
features and obtain a more robust representation. Recent work showed that by
casting the problem into the image-to-class recognition framework, the domain
adaptation problem is significantly alleviated \cite{danbnn}. Here we follow
this approach, and show how a very simple, learning free Naive Bayes Nearest
Neighbor (NBNN)-based domain adaptation algorithm can significantly alleviate
the distribution mismatch among source and target data, especially when the
number of classes and the number of sources grow. Experiments on standard
benchmarks used in the literature show that our approach (a) is competitive
with the current state of the art on small scale problems, and (b) achieves the
current state of the art as the number of classes and sources grows, with
minimal computational requirements.

We show a one-to-one correspondence between CAR and the emergence of
odd-frequency triplet superconductivity. Hence, non-local transport experiments
that identify CAR in helical liquids yield smoking-gun evidence for
unconventional superconductivity. Interestingly, we identify a setup --
composed of a superconductor flanked by two ferromagnetic insulators -- that

first-class names are a critical linguistic feature for efficient incremental

control over reuse. We demonstrate the benefits of names by presenting NOMINAL
ADAPTON, an ML-like language for incremental computation with names. We
describe how to use NOMINAL ADAPTON to efficiently incrementalize several
standard programming patterns -- including maps, folds, and unfolds -- and show
how to build efficient, incremental probabilistic trees and tries. Since
NOMINAL ADAPTON's implementation is subtle, we formalize it as a core calculus

answer as simply re-running the computation. Finally, we demonstrate that

suggests reproductive isolation arises most commonly in allopatry with a higher
speciation rate in small populations. Current theory does not address this
dependence in the important weak mutation regime. Here, we examine a
biophysical model of speciation based on the binding of a protein transcription
factor to a DNA binding site, and how their independent co-evolution, in a
stabilizing landscape, of two allopatric lineages leads to incompatibilities.
Our results give a new prediction for the monomorphic regime of evolution,
consistent with data, that smaller populations should develop incompatibilities
more quickly. This arises as: 1) smaller populations having a greater initial
drift load, as there are more sequences that bind poorly than well, so fewer
substitutions are needed to reach incompatible regions of phenotype space; 2)
slower divergence when the population size is larger than the inverse of
discrete differences in fitness. Further, we find longer sequences develop
incompatibilities more quickly at small population sizes, but more slowly at
large population sizes. The biophysical model thus represents a robust
mechanism of rapid reproductive isolation for small populations and large
sequences, that does not require peak-shifts or positive selection.

how this scheme influences the overall shape of the landscape. Our main tool
for the analysis are adaptive walks, an idealized dynamics by which the
population moves uphill in fitness and terminates at a local fitness maximum.
We use three different types of walks and investigate how their length (the
number of steps required to reach a local peak) and height (the fitness at the
endpoint of the walk) depend on the dimensionality and structure of the
landscape. We find that the distribution of local maxima over the landscape is
particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction pattern. Most quantities
that we measure are simply correlated to the rank of the scheme, which is equal
to the number of nonzero coefficients in the expansion of the fitness landscape

models of recidivism that are sufficiently accurate, transparent, and
interpretable to use for decision-making. This question is complicated as these
models are used to support different decisions, from sentencing, to determining
release on probation, to allocating preventative social services. Each use case
might have an objective other than classification accuracy, such as a desired
true positive rate (TPR) or false positive rate (FPR). Each (TPR, FPR) pair is
a point on the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. We use popular
machine learning methods to create models along the full ROC curve on a wide
range of recidivism prediction problems. We show that many methods (SVM, Ridge
Regression) produce equally accurate models along the full ROC curve. However,
methods that designed for interpretability (CART, C5.0) cannot be tuned to
produce models that are accurate and/or interpretable. To handle this
shortcoming, we use a new method known as SLIM (Supersparse Linear Integer
Models) to produce accurate, transparent, and interpretable models along the
full ROC curve. These models can be used for decision-making for many different
use cases, since they are just as accurate as the most powerful black-box
machine learning models, but completely transparent, and highly interpretable.

towards the steady state is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. The
steady state of subsystems weakly interacting with their environment is
described by the canonical ensemble which assumes the probability distribution
for energy to be of the Boltzmann form. The emergence of this probability
distribution is ensured by the detailed balance of the transitions induced by
the interaction with the environment. Here we consider relaxation of an open
correlated quantum system brought into contact with a reservoir in the vacuum
state. We refer to such a system as emissive since particles irreversibly
evaporate into the vacuum. The steady state of the system is a statistical
mixture of the stable eigenstates arising due to the binding energy. We found
that, despite the absence of the detailed balance, the stationary probability
distribution over these eigenstates is of the Boltzmann form in each
$N$-particle sector. A quantum statistical ensemble corresponding to the steady
state is characterized by different temperatures in the different sectors, in a
contrast to the Gibbs ensemble. We investigate the transition rates between the
eigenstates to understand the emergence of the Boltzmann distribution and find
their exponential dependence on the transition energy. We argue that this
property of transition rates is generic for a wide class of emissive quantum
many-body systems.

censoring those deemed ""uninformative"". While the independence of data from
censoring sensors is often assumed in previous research, we explore spatial
dependence among observations. Our focus is on designing the fusion rule under
the Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework that takes into account the spatial
dependence among observations. Two transmission scenarios are considered, one
where uncensored observations are transmitted directly to the FC and second
where they are first quantized and then transmitted to further improve
transmission efficiency. Copula-based Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT)
for censored data is proposed with both continuous and discrete messages
received at the FC corresponding to different transmission strategies. We
address the computational issues of the copula-based GLRTs involving
multidimensional integrals by presenting more efficient fusion rules, based on
the key idea of injecting controlled noise at the FC before fusion. Although,
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced by introducing controlled noise at
the receiver, simulation results demonstrate that the resulting noise-aided
fusion approach based on adding artificial noise performs very closely to the
exact copula-based GLRTs. Copula-based GLRTs and their noise-aided counterparts
by exploiting the spatial dependence greatly improve detection performance

ultrafast optical modulation. Here we report the first epsilon-near-zero AZO

is approximated by a finite set of solutions in the objective space. The
quality of the approximation can be measured by different indicators that take
into account the approximation's closeness to the Pareto front and its
distribution along the Pareto front. In particular, the averaged Hausdorff
indicator prefers an almost uniform distribution. An observed drawback of
multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (MEDAs) is that - as
common for randomized metaheuristics - the final population usually is not
uniformly distributed along the Pareto front. Therefore, we propose a
postprocessing strategy which consists of applying the averaged Hausdorff
indicator to the complete archive of generated solutions after optimization in
order to select a uniformly distributed subset of nondominated solutions from
the archive. In this paper, we put forward a strategy for extracting the above
described subset. The effectiveness of the proposal is contrasted in a series

environments may be poorly represented by standard experimental and theoretical

distributions in silico. We describe a novel type of response in which the
bacterium tumbles more when attractant concentration is increasing, in contrast
to the response of E. coli, and demonstrate how this response explains the
behavior of aerobically-grown Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In this ""speculator""
response, bacteria compare the current attractant concentration to the
long-term average. By tumbling persistently when the current concentration is
higher than the average, bacteria maintain their position in regions of high

agreement with results from a higher-level (HL) ab initio model. A parametrized
LL (pLL) model is created by multiplying selected matrix elements of the
Hamiltonian operators by scaling factors that depend on element types. Various
schemes for applying the scaling factors are compared, along with the impact of
making the scaling factors linear functions of variables related to bond
lengths, atomic charges, and bond orders. The models are trained on ethane and
ethylene, substituted with -NH2, -OH and -F, and tested on substituted propane,
propylene and t-butane. Training and test datasets are created by distorting
the molecular geometries and applying uniform electric fields. The fitted
properties include changes in total energy arising from geometric distortions
or applied fields, and frontier orbital energies. The impacts of including
additional training data, such as decomposition of the energy by operator or
interaction of the electron density with external charges, are also explored.
The best-performing model forms reduce the root mean square (RMS) difference
between the HL and LL energy predictions by over 85% on the training data and
over 75% on the test data. The argument is made that this approach has the
potential to provide a flexible and systematically-improvable means to take

$N\gg1$ axions, super-Planckian axion diameters $\cal{D}$ are readily allowed
by the WGC. We clarify the nontrivial relationship between the kinetic matrix
$K$ --- unambiguously defined by its form in a Minkowski-reduced basis --- and
the diameter of the axion fundamental domain, emphasizing that in general the
diameter is not solely determined by the eigenvalues $f_1^2 \le ... \le f_N^2$
of $K$: the orientations of the eigenvectors with respect to the
identifications imposed by instantons must be incorporated. In particular, even
if one were to impose the condition $f_N<M_{pl}$, this would imply neither
${\cal D}<M_{pl}$ nor ${\cal D}<\sqrt{N}M_{pl}$. We then estimate the actions
of instantons that fulfill the WGC. The leading instanton action is bounded
from below by $S \ge {\cal S} M_{pl}/f_N$, with ${\cal S}$ a fixed constant,
but in the universal limit $S\gtrsim {\cal S} \sqrt{N}M_{pl}/f_N$. Thus, having
$f_N>M_{pl}$ does not immediately imply the existence of unsuppressed higher
harmonic contributions to the potential. Finally, we argue that in effective
axion-gravity theories, the zero-form version of the WGC can be satisfied by
gravitational instantons that make negligible contributions to the potential.

space. While holonomies of the self-dual Ashtekar connection are not
well-defined in the kinematical Hilbert space, it is possible to introduce a
family of generalized holonomy-like operators of which some are well-defined;

The resulting quantum theory is closely related, although not identical, to

provide a good approximation to the full quantum dynamics for sharply-peaked

that for these states quantum gravity effects resolve the big-bang and
big-crunch singularities and replace them by a non-singular bounce. Finally,

with ages of 1$\,-\,$2 Gyr revealed main sequence turnoffs (MSTOs) that are
significantly wider than can be accounted for by a simple stellar population
(SSP). Such extended MSTOs (eMSTOs) are often interpreted in terms of an age
spread of several $10^8$ yr, challenging the traditional view of star clusters
as being formed in a single star formation episode. Li et al. and Bastian &
Niederhofer recently investigated the sub-giant branches (SGBs) of NGC 1651,
NGC 1806, and NGC 1846, three star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
that exhibit an eMSTO. They argued that the SGB of these star clusters can be
explained only by a SSP. We study these and two other similar star clusters in
the LMC, using extensive simulations of SSPs including unresolved binaries. We
find that the shapes of the cross-SGB profiles of all star clusters in our
sample are in fact consistent with their cross-MSTO profiles when the latter
are interpreted as age distributions. Conversely, SGB morphologies of star
clusters with eMSTOs are found to be inconsistent with those of simulated SSPs.
Finally, we create PARSEC isochrones from tracks featuring a grid of convective
overshoot levels and a very fine grid of stellar masses. A comparison of the
observed photometry with these isochrones shows that the morphology of the red
clump (RC) of such star clusters is also consistent with that implied by their
MSTO in the age spread scenario. We conclude that the SGB and RC morphologies
of star clusters featuring eMSTOs are consistent with the scenario in which the
eMSTOs are caused by a distribution of stellar ages.

strong coupling between Dark Energy (DE) and an ancillary Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) component together with the presence of an uncoupled Warm Dark Matter
component. The strong coupling between CDM and DE allows us to preserve small
scale fluctuations even if the warm particle is quite light ($\approx 100$ eV).
Our large scale simulations show that, for $10^{11}<M/M_\odot<10^{14}$, SCDEW
haloes exhibit a number density and distribution similar to a standard Lambda
Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model, even though they have lower concentration
parameters. High resolution simulation of a galactic halo ($M\sim 10^{12}
M_{\odot} $) shows $\sim 60\%$ less substructures than its LCDM counterpart,
but the same cuspy density profile. On the scale of galactic satellites ($M\sim
10^{9} M_{\odot}$) SCDEW haloes dramatically differ from LCDM. Due to the high
thermal velocities of the WDM component they are almost devoid of any
substructures and present strongly cored dark matter density profiles. These
density cores extend for several hundreds of parsecs, in very good agreement
with Milky Way satellites observations. Strongly coupled models, thanks to
their ability to match observations on both large and small scales might
represent a valid alternative to a simple LCDM model.

encompass a range of strategies for kilonova searches during GW follow-up. We
assess both the detectability of kilonovae and our ability to distinguish them

template images for the localization region are available, then nightly
observations to a depth of i=24 mag and z=23 mag are required to achieve a 95%

capture the kilonova peak and provide stronger constraints on the ejecta
properties. We also find that kilonovae can be robustly separated from other
types of transients utilizing cuts on color (i-z > 0 mag) and rise time (< 4
days). In the absence of a pre-existing template the observations must reach ~1
mag deeper to achieve the same kilonova detection rate, but robust rejection of
contaminants can still be achieved. Motivated by the results of our simulations
we discuss the expected performance of current and future wide-field telescopes

on ~Mpc scales, known as giant radio halos. One promising model for radio halos
is Fermi-II acceleration of seed relativistic electrons by turbulence of the
intracluster medium (ICM); Coulomb losses prohibit acceleration from the
thermal pool. However, the origin of seed electrons has never been fully
explored. Here, we integrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the cosmic ray (CR)
electron and proton distributions in a cosmological simulations of cluster
formation. For standard assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seed
electron population which produces too centrally concentrated radio emission.
Instead, we present three realistic scenarios that each can reproduce the
spatially flat radio emission observed in the Coma cluster: (1) the ratio of
injected turbulent energy density to thermal energy density increase
significantly with radius, as seen in cosmological simulations. This generates
a flat radio profile even if the seed population of CRs is steep with radius.
(2) Self-confinement of energetic CR protons can be inefficient, and CR protons
may stream at the Alfven speed to the cluster outskirts when the ICM is
relatively quiescent. A spatially flat CR proton distribution develops and
produces the required population of secondary seed electrons. (3) The CR proton
to electron acceleration efficiency K_ep ~ 0.1 is assumed to be larger than in
our Galaxy (K_ep ~ 0.01), due to the magnetic geometry at the shock. The
resulting primary electron population dominates. Due to their weaker density
dependence compared to secondary electrons, these primaries can also reproduce
radio observations. These competing non-trivial solutions provide incisive
probes of non thermal processes in the high-beta ICM.

Dark Energy is a scalar field $\Phi$; its coupling to ancillary CDM, whose
today's density is $\ll 1\, \%$, is an essential model feature. Such coupling,
in fact, allows the formation of cosmic structures, in spite of very low WDM
particle masses ($\sim 100$ eV). SCDEW models yields Cosmic Microwave
Background and linear Large Scale features substantially undistinguishable from
$\Lambda$CDM, but thanks to the very low WDM masses they strongly alleviate
$\Lambda$CDM issues on small scales, as confirmed via numerical simulations in
the II associated paper. Moreover SCDEW cosmologies significantly ease the
coincidence and fine tuning problems of $\Lambda$CDM and, by using a field
theory approach, we also outline possible links with inflationary models. We
also discuss a possible fading of the coupling at low redshifts which prevents
non linearities on the CDM component to cause computational problems. The
(possible) low-$z$ coupling suppression, its mechanism, and its consequences
are however still open questions -not necessarily problems- for SCDEW models.
The coupling intensity and the WDM particle mass, although being extra
parameters in respect to $\Lambda$CDM, are found to be substantially
constrained a priori so that, if SCDEW is the underlying cosmology, we expect
most data to fit also $\Lambda$CDM predictions.

richness and scales with the total stellar mass of the system, with little or

of massive ($>$10$^{11}$M$_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies have not
significantly changed since z$\sim$3, regardless of their environment. However,
for massive quiescent systems at lower redshifts (z$\lesssim$1.3), we find a
significant evolution in the number and stellar mass densities in denser
environments compared to lower density regions. Our results suggest that the
relation between stellar mass and local density is more fundamental than the
color-density relation and that environment plays a significant role in
quenching star formation activity in galaxies at z$\lesssim$1.

models of the multi-phase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback, which
produce reasonable galaxy properties at z = 0-6. We post-process the snapshots
with a radiative transfer code to evaluate the escape fraction (fesc) of
hydrogen ionizing photons. We find that the instantaneous fesc has large time
variability (0.01%-20%), while the time-averaged fesc over long time-scales
generally remains ~5%, considerably lower than the estimate in many
reionization models. We find no strong dependence of fesc on galaxy mass or
redshift. In our simulations, the intrinsic ionizing photon budgets are
dominated by stellar populations younger than 3 Myr, which tend to be buried in
dense birth clouds. The escaping photons mostly come from populations between
3-10 Myr, whose birth clouds have been largely cleared by stellar feedback.
However, these populations only contribute a small fraction of intrinsic
ionizing photon budgets according to standard stellar population models. We
show that fesc can be boosted to high values, if stellar populations older than
3 Myr produce more ionizing photons than standard stellar population models (as
motivated by, e.g., models including binaries). By contrast, runaway stars with
velocities suggested by observations can enhance fesc by only a small fraction.
We show that ""sub-grid"" star formation models, which do not explicitly resolve
star formation in dense clouds with n >> 1 cm^-3, will dramatically
over-predict fesc.

  In building Ringo, we take advantage of the fact that machines with large

allows us to build an easy-to-use interactive high-performance graph analytics
system. Graphs also need to be built from input data, which often resides in
the form of relational tables. Thus, Ringo provides rich functionality for
manipulating raw input data tables into various kinds of graphs. Furthermore,
Ringo also provides over 200 graph analytics functions that can then be applied
to constructed graphs.
  We show that a single big-memory machine provides a very attractive platform
for performing analytics on all but the largest graphs as it offers excellent
performance and ease of use as compared to alternative approaches. With Ringo,
we also demonstrate how to integrate graph analytics with an iterative process
of trial-and-error data exploration and rapid experimentation, common in data

bursts in the early stages of star formation. Using our numerical hydrodynamics
model with improved disk thermal balance and star-disk interaction, we computed
the evolution of protostellar disks formed from the gravitational collapse of
prestellar cores. In agreement with our previous studies, we find that cores of
higher initial mass and angular momentum produce disks that are more favorable
to gravitational instability and fragmentation, while a higher background
irradiation and magnetic fields moderate the disk tendency to fragment. The
protostellar accretion in our models is time-variable, thanks to the nonlinear
interaction between different spiral modes in the gravitationally unstable
disk, and can undergo episodic bursts when fragments migrate onto the star
owing to the gravitational interaction with other fragments or spiral arms.
Most bursts occur in the partly embedded Class I phase, with a smaller fraction
taking place in the deeply embedded Class 0 phase and a few possible bursts in
the optically visible Class II phase. The average burst duration and mean
luminosity are found to be in good agreement with those inferred from
observations of FU-Orionis-type eruptions. The model predicts the existence of
two types of bursts: the isolated ones, showing well-defined luminosity peaks
separated with prolonged periods (~ 10^4 yr) of quiescent accretion, and
clustered ones, demonstrating several bursts occurring one after another during
just a few hundred years. Finally, we estimate that 40\%--70\% of the
star-forming cores can display bursts after forming a star-disk system.

Conducting experiments, we verify that the implemented structure outperforms

complexities regarding load-balancing operations. More specifically, the
structure achieves a logarithmic amortized bound, using an efficient
deterministic load-balancing mechanism, which is general enough to be applied
to other hierarchical tree-based structures. Moreover, we investigate the
structure's fault tolerance, which hasn't been sufficiently tackled in previous

D3-Tree is highly fault tolerant, since, even for massive node failures, it
achieves a significant success rate in element queries. Afterwards we go one
step further, in order to achieve sub-logarithmic complexity and propose the
ART+ structure (Autonomous Range Tree), exploiting the excellent performance of
D3-Tree. ART+ is a fully dynamic and fault-tolerant structure, which achieves
sub-logarithmic performance for query and update operations and performs
load-balancing in sub-logarithmic amortized cost.

production of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The interest in this model
has recently been boosted by the latest chemical composition measurements of
cosmic rays, that seem to show the presence of a heavy nuclear component at the
highest energies. Neutrons stars, with their metal-rich surfaces, are
potentially interesting sources of such nuclei, but some open issues remain: 1)
is it possible to extract these nuclei from the star's surface? 2) Do the
nuclei survive the severe conditions present in the magnetosphere of the
neutron star? 3) What happens to the surviving nuclei once they enter the wind
that is launched outside the light cylinder? In this paper we address these
issues in a quantitative way, proving that for the most reasonable range of
neutron star surface temperatures ($T<10^7\,$K), a large fraction of heavy
nuclei survive photo-disintegration losses. These processes, together with
curvature losses and acceleration in the star's electric potential, lead to
injection of nuclei with a chemical composition that is mixed, even if only
iron is extracted from the surface. We show that under certain conditions the
chemical composition injected into the wind region is compatible with that
required in previous work based on purely phenomenological arguments (typically
$\sim 50\%$ protons, $\sim 30\%$ CNO and $\sim 20\%$ Fe), and provides a
reasonable explanation of the mass abundance inferred from ultra high energy

ellipsometer designed to work in the mid-infrared range, from 3 to 14 microns.
The Mueller ellipsometer, which can be mounted in reflection or in transmission
configuration, consists of a polarization state generator (PSG), a sample
holder, and a polarization state analyzer (PSA). The PSG consists in one linear
polarizer and a retarder sequentially rotated to generate a set of four optimal
polarization states. The retarder consists in a bi-prism made of two identical
Fresnel rhombs disposed symmetrically and joined by optical contact, giving the
ensemble a ""V"" shape. Retardation is induced by the four total internal
reflections that the beam undergoes when it propagates through the bi-prism.
Total internal reflection allows to generate a quasi-achromatic retardation.
The PSA is identical to the PSG, but with its optical elements mounted in
reverse order. After a measurement run, the instrument yields a set of sixteen
independent values, which is the minimum amount of data required to calculate
the Mueller matrix of the sample. The design of the Mueller ellipsometer is
based on the optimization of an objective criterion that allows minimizing the
propagation of errors from raw data to the Mueller matrix of the sample. The
pseudo-achromatic optical elements ensure a homogeneous quality of the
measurements for all wavelengths. The performance of the Mueller ellipsometer
in terms of precision, and accuracy, is discussed and illustrated with a few
examples.

here as tangential discontinuity) between the viscous corona and the partially
ionised prominence plasma in the incompressible limit. The importance of the
partial ionisation is investigated in terms of the ionisation fraction.
Matching the solutions for the transversal component of the velocity and total
pressure at the interface between the prominence and coronal plasmas, we derive
a dispersion relation whose imaginary part describes the evolution of the
instability. Results are obtained in the limit of weak dissipation. Using
simple analytical methods, we show that dissipative instabilities appear for
flow speeds that are lower than the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability threshold.
While viscosity tends to destabilise the plasma, the effect of partial
ionisation (through the Cowling resistivity) will act towards stabilising the
interface. For ionisation degrees closer to a neutral gas the interface will be
unstable for larger values of equilibrium flow. The same principle is assumed
when studying the appearance of instability at the interface between
prominences and dark plumes. The unstable mode appearing in this case has a
very small growth rate and dissipative instability cannot explain the
appearance of flows in plumes. The present study improves our understanding of
the complexity of dynamical processes at the interface of solar prominences and
solar corona, and the role partial ionisation can have on the stability of the
plasma. Our results clearly show that the problem of partial ionisation
introduces new aspects of plasma stability with consequences on the evolution
of solar prominences.

have the highest theoretical specific energy and as a result have attracted
significant research attention over the past decade. A critical scientific
challenge facing nonaqueous Li-O$_2$ batteries is the electronically insulating
nature of the primary discharge product, lithium peroxide, which passivates the
battery cathode as it is formed, leading to low ultimate cell capacities.
Recently, strategies to enhance solubility to circumvent this issue have been
reported, but rely upon electrolyte formulations that further decrease the
overall electrochemical stability of the system, thereby deleteriously
affecting battery rechargeability. In this study, we report that a significant
enhancement (greater than four-fold) in Li-O$_2$ cell capacity is possible by
appropriately selecting the salt anion in the electrolyte solution. Using
$^7$Li nuclear magnetic resonance and modeling, we confirm that this
improvement is a result of enhanced Li$^+$ stability in solution, which in turn
induces solubility of the intermediate to Li$_2$O$_2$ formation. Using this
strategy, the challenging task of identifying an electrolyte solvent that
possesses the anti-correlated properties of high intermediate solubility and
solvent stability is alleviated, potentially providing a pathway to develop an
electrolyte that affords both high capacity and rechargeability. We believe the
model and strategy presented here will be generally useful to enhance Coulombic
efficiency in many electrochemical systems (e.g. Li-S batteries) where
improving intermediate stability in solution could induce desired mechanisms of
product formation.

reliability of storage systems. While the exponentially distributed sojourn
time of Markov models is widely known to be unrealistic (and it is necessary to
consider Weibull-type models for components such as disks), recent work has
also highlighted some additional infirmities with the CTMC model, such as the
ability to handle repair times. Due to the memoryless property of these models,
any failure or repair of one component resets the ""clock"" to zero with any
partial repair or aging in some other subsystem forgotten. It has therefore
been argued that simulation is the only accurate technique available for
modelling the reliability of a storage system with multiple components.
  We show how both the above problematic aspects can be handled when we
consider a careful set of approximations in a detailed model of the system. A
detailed model has many states, and the transitions between them and the
current state captures the ""memory"" of the various components. We model a
non-exponential distribution using a sum of exponential distributions, along
with the use of a CTMC solver in a probabilistic model checking tool that has
support for reducing large state spaces. Furthermore, it is possible to get
results close to what is obtained through simulation and at much lower cost.

in statistics. The common, min-max, formulation of this goal considers the
performance of the best estimator over all distributions in a class. It shows
that with $n$ samples, distributions over $k$ symbols can be learned to a KL
divergence that decreases to zero with the sample size $n$, but grows
unboundedly with the alphabet size $k$.
  Min-max performance can be viewed as regret relative to an oracle that knows
the underlying distribution. We consider two natural and modest limits on the
oracle's power. One where it knows the underlying distribution only up to
symbol permutations, and the other where it knows the exact distribution but is
restricted to use natural estimators that assign the same probability to
symbols that appeared equally many times in the sample.
  We show that in both cases the competitive regret reduces to
$\min(k/n,\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt n))$, a quantity upper bounded uniformly
for every alphabet size. This shows that distributions can be estimated nearly
as well as when they are essentially known in advance, and nearly as well as
when they are completely known in advance but need to be estimated via a
natural estimator. We also provide an estimator that runs in linear time and
incurs competitive regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min(k/n,1/\sqrt n))$, and
show that for natural estimators this competitive regret is inevitable. We also
demonstrate the effectiveness of competitive estimators using simulations.

free particle and a harmonic oscillator, it is shown that such non-Markovian
effects account for the differentiability of the Brownian trajectories as well
as the breakdown of the energy equipartition of statistical mechanics at short
times in some physical situations. This non-Markovian approach is also extended
to look at anomalous diffusion. Next, we bring in the dynamical-quantization
method for investigating open quantum systems, which does consist in quantizing
the classical Brownian motion starting directly from our non-Markovian
Klein-Kramers and Smoluchowski equations, without alluding to any model
Hamiltonian. Accordingly, quantizing our non-Markovian Klein-Kramers in phase
space gives rise to a non-Markovian quantum master equation in configuration
space, whereas quantizing our non-Markovian Smoluchowski equation in
configuration space leads to a non-Markovian quantum Smoluchowski equation in
phase space. In addition, it is worth noticing that non-Markovian quantum
Brownian motion takes place in presence of a generic environment (e.g. a
non-thermal quantum fluid). As far as the special case of a heat bath
comprising of quantum harmonic oscillators is concerned, a non-Markovian

relaxation of a carrier performing a random walk on a d-dimensional regular
lattice, in a transport regime typical for organic semiconductors. We show that
in d=1 and d=2 the time dependence of the space-integrated spin polarization,
P(t), is dominated by a superexponential decay, crossing over to a stretched
exponential tail at long times. The faster decay is attributed to multiple
self-intersections (returns) of the random walk trajectories, which occur more
often in lower dimensions. We also show, analytically and numerically, that the
returns lead to sensitivity of P(t) to external electric and magnetic fields,
and this sensitivity strongly depends on dimensionality of the system (d=1 vs.
d=3). Furthermore, we investigate in detail the coordinate dependence of the
time-integrated spin polarization, $\sigma(r)$, which can be probed in the spin
transport experiments with spin-polarized electrodes. We demonstrate that,
while $\sigma(r)$ is essentially exponential, the effect of multiple
self-intersections can be identified in transport measurements from the strong
dependence of the spin decay length on the external magnetic and electric
fields.

structural stabilization, using In wires on Si(111) as a prototypical example.
Our systematic density-functional theory calculations reveal that, first, for
the same degrees of carrier doping into the In wires, the ES of the

that of the low-temperature insulating 8x2 structure is much larger and highly
anisotropic. As a consequence, the intrinsic energy difference between the two
phases is significantly reduced towards electronically phase-separated ground
states. Our calculations further demonstrate quantitatively that such
intriguing phase tunabilities can be achieved equivalently via
lattice-contraction induced MS in the absence of charge doping. We also
validate the equivalence through our detailed scanning tunneling microscopy
experiments. The present findings have important implications in understanding
the underlying driving forces involved in various phase transitions of simple

renormalization group evolution of mixing parameters and masses for both Dirac
and Majorana type neutrinos. Following this hypothesis, the PMNS mixing
parameters are taken to be identical to the CKM ones at a unifying high scale.
Then, they are evolved to a low scale using MSSM renormalization-group
equations. For both type of neutrinos, the renormalization group evolution
'naturally' results in a non-zero and small value of leptonic mixing angle
$\theta_{13}$. One of the important predictions of this analysis is that, in
both cases, the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ turns out to be non-maximal for most

machine learning. The cross validation (CV) and the widely applicable
information criterion (WAIC) are predictive measures of the Bayesian
estimation, however, it has been difficult to apply them to find the optimal
prior because their mathematical properties in prior evaluation have been
unknown and the region of the hyperparameters is too wide to be examined. In
this paper, we derive a new formula by which the theoretical relation among CV,
WAIC, and the generalization loss is clarified and the optimal hyperparameter
can be directly found.
  By the formula, three facts are clarified about predictive prior design.
Firstly, CV and WAIC have the same second order asymptotic expansion, hence
they are asymptotically equivalent to each other as the optimizer of the
hyperparameter. Secondly, the hyperparameter which minimizes CV or WAIC makes
the average generalization loss to be minimized asymptotically but does not the
random generalization loss. And lastly, by using the mathematical relation
between priors, the variances of the optimized hyperparameters by CV and WAIC
are made smaller with small computational costs. Also we show that the
optimized hyperparameter by DIC or the marginal likelihood does not minimize
the average or random generalization loss in general.

distributions of extragalactic compact radio sources. The comparison of the two
correlator outputs show that they are consistent with each other within $<8\%$,
which is comparable with the amplitude calibration uncertainties of KVN
observations at 22~GHz. We also found that the 8\% difference in flux density
is caused mainly by (a) the difference in the way of fringe phase tracking
between the DiFX software correlator and the Daejeon hardware correlator, and
(b) an unusual pattern (a double-layer pattern) of the amplitude correlation
output from the Daejeon correlator. The visibility amplitude loss by the

systems and investigate the value-of-information. In such systems, the
operators match tasks and resources stored in queues, with the objective of
maximizing the system utility of the matching reward profile, minus the average
matching cost. This problem appears in many practical systems and the main
challenges are the no-underflow constraints, and the lack of matching-reward
information and system dynamics statistics. We develop two online matching
algorithms: Learning-aided Reward optimAl Matching ($\mathtt{LRAM}$) and
Dual-$\mathtt{LRAM}$ ($\mathtt{DRAM}$) to effectively resolve both challenges.
Both algorithms are equipped with a learning module for estimating the
matching-reward information, while $\mathtt{DRAM}$ incorporates an additional
module for learning the system dynamics. We show that both algorithms achieve
an $O(\epsilon+\delta_r)$ close-to-optimal utility performance for any
$\epsilon>0$, while $\mathtt{DRAM}$ achieves a faster convergence speed and a
better delay compared to $\mathtt{LRAM}$, i.e., $O(\delta_{z}/\epsilon +
\log(1/\epsilon)^2))$ delay and $O(\delta_z/\epsilon)$ convergence under
$\mathtt{DRAM}$ compared to $O(1/\epsilon)$ delay and convergence under
$\mathtt{LRAM}$ ($\delta_r$ and $\delta_z$ are maximum estimation errors for
reward and system dynamics). Our results reveal that information of different
system components can play very different roles in algorithm performance and
provide a systematic way for designing joint learning-control algorithms for
dynamic systems.

superfluid flow with finite quasimomentum, we find that, in the BCS side of the

to the normal Bloch states and their survival time against dynamical

accessible in current experiments, in sharp contrast to the situation in BECs.

sparse representation of data. The proposed approach infers probability
distributions over the atoms of a discriminative dictionary using a Beta
Process. It also computes sets of Bernoulli distributions that associate class
labels to the learned dictionary atoms. This association signifies the
selection probabilities of the dictionary atoms in the expansion of
class-specific data. Furthermore, the non-parametric character of the proposed
approach allows it to infer the correct size of the dictionary. We exploit the
aforementioned Bernoulli distributions in separately learning a linear
classifier. The classifier uses the same hierarchical Bayesian model as the
dictionary, which we present along the analytical inference solution for Gibbs
sampling. For classification, a test instance is first sparsely encoded over
the learned dictionary and the codes are fed to the classifier. We performed
experiments for face and action recognition; and object and scene-category
classification using five public datasets and compared the results with
state-of-the-art discriminative sparse representation approaches. Experiments
show that the proposed Bayesian approach consistently outperforms the existing

applications in cancer systems biology. Many gene expression studies, however,
are hampered by low sample size and it has therefore become popular to increase
sample size by collecting gene expression data across studies. Motivated by the
traditional meta-analysis using random effects models, we present a
hierarchical random covariance model and use it for the meta-analysis of gene
correlation networks across 11 large-scale gene expression studies of diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We suggest to use a maximum likelihood estimator
for the underlying common covariance matrix and introduce an EM algorithm for
estimation. By simulation experiments comparing the estimated covariance
matrices by cophenetic correlation and Kullback-Leibler divergence the
suggested estimator showed to perform better or not worse than a simple pooled
estimator. In a posthoc analysis of the estimated common covariance matrix for
the DLBCL data we were able to identify novel biologically meaningful gene
correlation networks with eigengenes of prognostic value. In conclusion, the
method seems to provide a generally applicable framework for meta-analysis,
when multiple features are measured and believed to share a common covariance
matrix obscured by study dependent noise.

clumps coexist in a similar region over $\sim$2 kpc, while the stellar

systematic velocity gradient in the north-south direction, which may indicate a
rotating gas disk. One possible scenario is that the components of molecular

the stellar emission is heavily obscured by dust in the central star-forming

phase-dependent variations, in intensity and velocity, of numerous helium
emission and absorption lines throughout the entire 5.54-year orbit.
Approaching periastron, the 3D structure of the wind-wind interaction region
(WWIR) gets highly distorted due to the eccentric ($e \sim 0.9$) binary orbit.
The secondary star ($\eta_{\mathrm{B}}$) at these phases is located deep within
the primary's dense wind photosphere. The combination of these effects is
thought to be the cause of the particularly interesting features observed in
the helium lines at periastron. We perform 3D radiative transfer simulations of
$\eta$ Car's interacting winds at periastron. Using the SimpleX radiative
transfer algorithm, we post-process output from 3D smoothed particle
hydrodynamic simulations of the inner 150 au of the $\eta$ Car system for two
different primary star mass-loss rates ($\dot{M}_{\eta_{\mathrm{A}}}$). Using
previous results from simulations at apastron as a guide for the initial
conditions, we compute 3D helium ionization maps. We find that, for higher
$\dot{M}_{\eta_{\mathrm{A}}}$, $\eta_{\mathrm{B}}$ He$^{0+}$-ionizing photons
are not able to penetrate into the pre-shock primary wind. He$^{+}$ due to
$\eta_{\mathrm{B}}$ is only present in a thin layer along the leading arm of
the WWIR and in a small region close to the stars. Lowering
$\dot{M}_{\eta_{\mathrm{A}}}$ allows $\eta_{\mathrm{B}}$'s ionizing photons to
reach the expanding unshocked secondary wind on the apastron side of the
system, and create a low fraction of He$^{+}$ in the pre-shock primary wind.
With apastron on our side of the system, our results are qualitatively
consistent with the observed variations in strength and radial velocity of
$\eta$ Car's helium emission and absorption lines, which helps better constrain
the regions where these lines arise.

spin) observables used in Bell's argument against local realism have to be
interpreted as {\it conditional} quantum correlations. By taking into account
additional sources of randomness in Bell's type experiments, i.e.,
supplementary to source randomness, I calculate (in the standard quantum
formalism) the complete quantum correlations. The main message of the quantum
theory of measurement (due to von Neumann) is that complete correlations can be
essentially smaller than the conditional ones. Additional sources of randomness
diminish correlations. One can say another way around: transition from
unconditional correlations to conditional can increase them essentially. This
is true for both classical and quantum probability. The final remark is that
classical conditional correlations do not satisfy Bell's inequality. Thus we
met the following {\it conditional probability dilemma}: either to use the
conditional quantum probabilities, as was done by Bell and others, or complete
quantum correlations. However, in the first case the corresponding classical
conditional correlations need not satisfy Bell's inequality and in the second
case the complete quantum correlations satisfy Bell's inequality. Thus in
neither case we have a problem of mismatching of classical and quantum
correlations. It seems that the whole structure of Bell's argument was based on
unacceptable identification of conditional quantum correlations with
unconditional classical correlations.

from both Einstein and Mileva. Some interpretations of the usage of pronouns in

examined and the content of each subsequent paper is compared to the work that

MEG signals contained orientation-specific information as early as ~50ms after
stimulus onset even when controlling for confounds, such as overrepresentation
of particular orientations, stimulus edge interactions, and global form-related

evolution of thin magnetic flux tubes in the solar interior. Radiative
diffusion is the primary supplier of heat to convective motions in the lower
convection zone, and it results in a heat input per unit volume of magnetic
flux tubes that has been ignored by many previous thin flux tube studies. We
use a thin flux tube model subject to convection taken from a rotating
spherical shell of turbulent, solar-like convection as described by Weber, Fan,
and Miesch (2011, Astrophys. J., 741, 11; 2013, Solar Phys., 287, 239), now
taking into account the influence of radiative heating on flux tubes of
large-scale active regions. Our simulations show that flux tubes of less than
or equal to 60 kG subject to solar-like convective flows do not anchor in the
overshoot region, but rather drift upward due to the increased buoyancy of the
flux tube earlier in its evolution as a result of the inclusion of radiative
diffusion. Flux tubes of magnetic field strengths ranging from 15 kG to 100 kG
have rise times of less than or equal to 0.2 years, and exhibit a Joy's Law
tilt-angle trend. Our results suggest that radiative heating is an effective
mechanism by which flux tubes can escape from the stably stratified overshoot
region, and that flux tubes do not necessarily need to be anchored in the
overshoot region to produce emergence properties similar to those of active
regions on the Sun.

since community detection methods have random factors and real social networks

significance of community structure partitioned is an urgent and important
question. In this paper, integrating the specific characteristics of real
society, we present a novel framework analyzing the significance of social
community specially. The dynamics of social interactions are modeled by
identifying social leaders and corresponding hierarchical structures. Instead
of a direct comparison with the average outcome of a random model, we compute
the similarity of a given node with the leader by the number of common
neighbors. To determine the membership vector, an efficient community detection
algorithm is proposed based on the position of nodes and their corresponding
leaders. Then, using log-likelihood score, the tightness of community can be
derived. Based on the distribution of community tightness, we establish a new
connection between $p$-value theory and network analysis and then get a novel
statistical form significance measure. Finally, the framework is applied to
both benchmark networks and real social networks. Experimental results show
that our work can be used in many fields, such as determining the optimal
number of communities, analyzing the social significance of a given community,
comparing the performance among various algorithms and so on.

appears to be promising. We present in particular simulations suggesting that
spatial coupling is more robust and allows for better reconstruction at finite

voluntary behavior --- and each vaccinated individual carries a perceived cost.
We ask whether the classical targeted subsidy strategy is definitely better
than the random strategy: does targeting subsidy at individuals perceived to be
with the greatest risk actually help? With these questions, we propose a model
to investigate the \emph{interaction effects} of the subsidy policies and
individuals responses when facing subsidy policies on the epidemic dynamics on
complex networks. In the model, a small proportion of individuals are freely
vaccinated according to either the targeted or random subsidy policy, the
remainder choose to vaccinate (or not) based on voluntary principle and update
their vaccination decision via an imitation rule. Our findings show that the
targeted strategy is only advantageous when individuals prefer to imitate the
subsidized individuals' strategy. Otherwise, the effect of the targeted policy
is worse than the random immunization, since individuals preferentially select
non-subsidized individuals as the imitation objects. More importantly, we find
that under the targeted subsidy policy, increasing the proportion of subsidized
individuals may increase the final epidemic size. We further define social cost
as the sum of the costs of vaccination and infection, and study how each of the
two policies affect the social cost. Our result shows that there exist some
optimal intermediate regions leading to the minimal social cost.

high-temperature superconductivity observed recently at the interface between
monolayer FeSe and STO substrate. However, the origin of this mode is not
clear. Through first-principles calculations, we find that there is a novel
polar phonon mode on the surface layers of the STO substrate, which does not
exist in the STO crystals. The oxygen vacancies near the FeSe/STO interface
drives the dispersion of this phonon mode to be flat and lowers its energy,
whereas the charge transfer between STO substrate and FeSe monolayer further
reduces its energy to 81 meV. This energy is in good agreement with the
experimental value fitted by Lee et al. for the phonon mode responsible for the
observed replica band separations and the increased superconducting gap. The
oxygen-vacancy-induced flat and polar phonon mode provides clues for
understanding the origin of high Tc superconductivity at the FeSe/STO
interface.

theory. This is mainly for two reasons. One relies on the gravitational
potential of a moving lens being time-dependent (the $\text{Moving}$
$\text{Cluster}$ $\text{Effect}$, $\text{MCE}$). The other is due to uneven
magnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\text{Differential}$
$\text{Magnification}$ $\text{Effect}$, $\text{DME}$). The time delay between
the images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological
expansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small. Using a
simple model, we derive these effects from first principles.
  One application would be to the Bullet Cluster, whose large tangential
velocity may be inconsistent with the $\Lambda CDM$ paradigm. This velocity can
be estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such
models can be avoided using the MCE. We argue that the MCE should be observable
with ALMA.
  However, such measurements can be corrupted by the DME if typical spiral
galaxies are used as sources. Fortunately, we find that if detailed spectral
line profiles were available, then the DME and MCE could be distinguished. It
might also be feasible to calculate how much the DME should affect the mean
redshift of each image. Resolved observations of the source would be required
to do this accurately.
  The DME is of order the source angular size divided by the Einstein radius
times the redshift variation across the source. Thus, it mostly affects nearly
edge-on spiral galaxies in certain orientations. This suggests that observers
should reduce the DME by careful choice of target, a possibility we discuss in
some detail.

Geometry of the return map, frequency of UPOs visiting the same trajectory,
length of the data set, strength of the noise and degree of nonstationarity
affect the efficacy of the proposed method. Results suggest that establishing
determinism from unambiguous UPO detection is often possible in short data sets
with significant noise, but derived dynamical properties are rarely accurate

the most generic scaling relations of the irreversible work (the residual

limits namely, the heat susceptibility limit and the thermodynamic limit. It is
then argued that the irreversible entropy generated for a thermal quench at low
enough temperature when the system is initially in a Gibbs state, is likely to
show a similar scaling behavior. To illustrate this proposition, we consider
zero-temperature and thermal quenches in one and two-dimensional Dirac
Hamiltonians where the exact estimation of the irreversible work and the
irreversible entropy is indeed possible. Exploiting these exact results, we
then establish: (i) the irreversible work at zero temperature indeed shows an
appropriate scaling in the thermodynamic limit; (ii) the scaling of the
irreversible work in the 1D Dirac model at zero-temperature shows logarithmic
corrections to the scaling which is a signature of a marginal situation. (iii)
Furthermore, remarkably the logarithmic corrections do indeed appear in the
scaling of the entropy generated if temperature is low enough while disappears
for high temperatures. For the 2D model, no such logarithmic correction is
found to appear.

witnessed significant progress during the recent years. At the energies and

non-negligible contributions from (first) forbidden transitions. For several
nuclei allowed Gamow-Teller strength distributions could be derived from

Importantly the diagonalization shell model has been proven to accurately

framework of the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation, which describes the

associated nucleosynthesis. These include the absorption of neutrinos by nuclei
(the inverse of nuclear electron capture which is the dominating
weak-interaction process during collapse), inelastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering and nuclear de-excitation by neutrino-pair emission. We also discuss
the role of neutrino-induced reactions for the recently discovered $\nu p$

neutrino-nucleus reactions have the largest impact. Finally, we briefly review
neutrino-nucleus reactions important for the observation of supernova neutrinos

UV corrections, such as from quantum gravity: in the language of the effective

present scenarios which realise both requirements by examining the structure of
Goldstone potentials arising from Coleman-Weinberg contributions. We focus on
single-field models, for which we notice that both bosonic and fermionic
contributions are required and that spinorial fermion representations can
generate the right potential shape. We then evaluate the constraints on
non-Gaussianity from higher-derivative interactions, finding that axiomatic
constraints on Goldstone boson scattering prevail over the current CMB
measurements. The fit to CMB data can be connected to the UV completions for
Goldstone Inflation, finding relations in the spectrum of new resonances.
Finally, we show how hybrid inflation can be realised in the same context,
where both the inflaton and the waterfall fields share a common origin as
Goldstones.

that the excitation of SPPs by a chiral source not only results in a locally

assuming specific forms of the coupling as $A$ namely, $\alpha \dot{\rho_m}$,
$\beta \dot{\rho_{\phi}}$ and $\sigma (\dot{\rho_m}+\dot{\rho_{\phi}})$, and
present phase space analysis for three different interacting models. We focus
on the attractor solutions that can give rise to late time acceleration with
$\Omega_{DE}/\Omega_{DM}$ of order unity in order to alleviate the coincidence
problem.

"1503.09057","Chao Xu","Chao Xu, Steven Skiena","Marking Streets to Improve Parking Density","11 pages and 8 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Street parking spots for automobiles are a scarce commodity in most urban
environments. The heterogeneity of car sizes makes it inefficient to rigidly
define fixed-sized spots. Instead, unmarked streets in cities like New York
leave placement decisions to individual drivers, who have no direct incentive
to maximize street utilization.
  In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of two different behavioral
interventions designed to encourage better parking, namely (1) educational
campaigns to encourage parkers to ""kiss the bumper"" and reduce the distance
between themselves and their neighbors, or (2) painting appropriately-spaced
markings on the street and urging drivers to ""hit the line"". Through analysis
and simulation, we establish that the greatest densities are achieved when
lines are painted to create spots roughly twice the length of average-sized
cars. Kiss-the-bumper campaigns are in principle more effective than
hit-the-line for equal degrees of compliance, although we believe that the
visual cues of painted lines induce better parking behavior.

given any real numbers $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$, there is a real number $x$ such
that \begin{equation*} \max \{\left\langle ax-t_{1}\right\rangle ,\left\langle

to the nearest integer. The number $\alpha $ is known as the angular Kronecker
constant of $\{a,b,n\}$. We also find the least $\beta $ such that the same
inequality holds with upper bound $\beta $ when we consider only approximating
$t_{1},t_{2},t_{3}$ $\in \{0,1/2\}$, the so-called binary Kronecker constant.
The answers are complicated and depend on the congruence of $n\mod(a+b)$.
Surprisingly, the angular and binary Kronecker constants agree except if
$n\equiv a^{2}\mod(a+b)$.

Voigt function, obtained by residue calculus. The computational test reveals
that with only $16$ summation terms this approximation provides average
accuracy ${10^{- 14}}$ over a wide domain of practical interest $0 < x <
40,000$ and ${10^{- 4}} < y < {10^2}$ for applications using the HITRAN
molecular spectroscopic database. The proposed rational approximation takes
less than half the computation time of that required by Weideman's rational
approximation. Algorithmic stability is achieved due to absence of the poles at
$y \geqslant 0$ and $ - \infty < x < \infty $.
