control tasks lead to over-provisioning in hardware design (or
underexploitation in hardware utilization) in control applications, such as
networked control systems. To address these issues, researchers have proposed a
new class of strategies, named event-driven strategies. Despite of their
beneficiary effects, matters like task scheduling and appropriate dimensioning
of communication components have become more complicated with respect to
traditional periodic strategies. In this paper, we present a formal approach to
derive an abstracted system that captures the sampling behavior of a family of
event-triggered strategies for the case of LTI systems. This structure
approximately simulates the sampling behavior of the aperiodic control system.
Furthermore, the resulting quotient system is equivalent to a timed automaton.
In the construction of the abstraction, the state space is confined to a finite
number of convex regions, each of which represents a mode in the quotient
system. An LMI-based technique is deployed to derive a sampling time interval
associated to each region. Finally, reachability analysis is leveraged to find
the transitions of the quotient system.

Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes are unstable against superradiance instability
of a scalar field. Recent works extended the existence of this instability to
five dimensional rotating charged AdS black holes or static charged AdS black
holes in arbitrary dimensions. In this work we analytically prove that,
rotating small AdS black holes in arbitrary dimensions also show superradiance
instability irrespective of the value of the (positive) angular momentum
quantum number. To do this we solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the slow
rotation, low frequency limit. By using the asymptotic matching technique, we
are able to calculate the real and imaginary parts of the correction terms to
the frequency of the scalar field due to the presence of the black hole,
confirming the presence of superradiance instability. We see that, unlike in
the case of static AdS black holes, the analytical method is valid for rotating
AdS black holes for any value of angular momentum number and space-time

Myers-Perry black holes in the black hole bomb formalism in Appendix and see

images of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), groups and clusters of galaxies and
quasars. Appearing as a partial Einstein ring (r_e~3"") around an LRG at z=0.2,
the galaxy is extremely bright in the sub-millimetre for a cosmological source,
with the thermal dust emission approaching 1 Jy at peak. The redshift of the
lensed galaxy is determined through the detection of the CO(3-2) molecular
emission line with the Large Millimetre Telescope's Redshift Search Receiver
and through [OIII] and H-alpha line detections in the near-infrared from
Subaru/IRCS. We have resolved the radio emission with high resolution (300-400

combination with the near-infrared imaging to construct a lens model, which
indicates a lensing magnification of ~10x. The source reconstruction appears to
support a radio morphology comprised of a compact (<250 pc) core and more
extended component, perhaps indicative of an active nucleus and jet or lobe.

Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is an alternative methodology that exploits
the social contacts between peers to reach and weight individuals in these
hard-to-reach populations. It is a snowball sampling procedure where the weight
of the respondents is adjusted for the likelihood of being sampled due to
differences in the number of contacts. In RDS, the structure of the social
contacts thus defines the sampling process and affects its coverage, for
instance by constraining the sampling within a sub-region of the network. In
this paper we study the bias induced by network structures such as social
triangles, community structure, and heterogeneities in the number of contacts,
in the recruitment trees and in the RDS estimator. We simulate different
scenarios of network structures and response-rates to study the potential
biases one may expect in real settings. We find that the prevalence of the
estimated variable is associated with the size of the network community to
which the individual belongs. Furthermore, we observe that low-degree nodes may
be under-sampled in certain situations if the sample and the network are of
similar size. Finally, we also show that low response-rates lead to reasonably
accurate average estimates of the prevalence but generate relatively large
biases.

related with the problem of extended core states which is currently solved by
applying the LAPW method with local orbitals (LAPW+LO). In comparison with
LAPW+LO, the number of supplemented basis functions in our approach is doubled,
which opens up a new channel for the extension of the LAPW and LAPW+LO basis
sets. The appearance of new supplemented basis functions absent in the LAPW+LO

minimum number of training samples, as this reduces the number of laboratory
tests and thus the cost of model building. In these chemometric models, the

utilizing the disagreements of an ensemble of neural networks to represent the

Current cuts in this channel have been optimized for Higgs discovery via the
dominant tree level $ZZ$ contribution arising from electroweak symmetry
breaking. Going forward, one of the primary objectives of this sensitive
channel will be to probe other Higgs couplings and search for new physics on
top of the tree level $ZZ$ `background'. Thanks to interference between these
small couplings and the large tree level contribution to $ZZ$, the $h\to 4\ell$
decay is uniquely capable of probing the magnitude \emph{and} CP phases of the
Higgs couplings to $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ as well as, to a lesser extent,
$ZZ$ couplings arising from higher dimensional operators. With this in mind we
examine how much relaxing current cuts can enhance the sensitivity while also
accounting for the dominant non-Higgs continuum $q\bar{q}\to4\ell$ background.
We find the largest enhancement in sensitivity for the $hZ\gamma$ couplings
($\gtrsim 100\%$) followed by $h\gamma\gamma$ ($\gtrsim 40\%$) and less so for
the higher dimensional $hZZ$ couplings (a few percent). With these
enhancements, we show that couplings of order Standard Model values for
$h\gamma\gamma$ may optimistically be probed by end of Run-II at the LHC while
for $hZ\gamma$ perhaps towards the end of a high luminosity LHC. Thus an
appropriately optimized $h\to4\ell$ analysis can complement direct decays of
the Higgs to on-shell $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ pairs giving a unique
opportunity to directly access the CP properties of these couplings.

may be nonspherical. In this case, the assembling process of the Galaxy may
have left long lasting stellar halo kinematic fossils due to the shape of the
dark matter halo, potentially originated by orbital resonances. We further
investigate such possibility, considering now potential models further away
from $\Lambda$CDM halos, like scalar field dark matter halos, MOND, and
including several other factors that may mimic the emergence and permanence of
kinematic groups, such as, a spherical and triaxial halo with an embedded disk
potential. We find that regardless of the density profile (DM nature),
kinematic groups only appear in the presence of a triaxial halo potential. For
the case of a MOND like gravity theory no kinematic structure is present. We
conclude that the detection of these kinematic stellar groups could confirm the
predicted triaxiality of dark halos in cosmological galaxy formation scenarios.

individuals were genotyped at these locations and multi-locus genotype
frequencies were compared to 172 sequenced individuals from the original
unselected pool (a control group). Various non-random associations were found
across the genome, both within chromosomes and between chromosomes. Some of the
non-random associations are likely due to retention of linkage disequilibrium
in the F12 population, however many, including the inter-chromosomal
interactions, must be due to genetic interactions in heat tolerance. One region
of particular interest involves 3 linked loci on chromosome IV where the
central variant responsible for heat tolerance is antagonistic, coming from the
heat sensitive parent and the flanking ones are from the more heat tolerant
parent. The 3-locus haplotypes in the selected individuals represent a highly
biased sample of the population haplotypes with rare double recombinants in
high frequency. These were missed in the original analysis and would never be
seen without the multigenerational approach. We show that a statistical
analysis of entropy and information gain in genotypes of a selected population
can reveal further interactions than previously seen. Importantly this must be
done in comparison to the unselected population's genotypes to account for
inherent biases in the original population.

under any traffic pattern such that all the ports are loaded. This system is
interesting to study since the queue lengths exhibit a multi-dimensional
state-space collapse in the heavy-traffic regime. We use a Lyapunov-type drift
technique to characterize the heavy-traffic behavior of the expectation of the
sum queue lengths in steady-state, under the assumption that all ports are
saturated and all queues receive non-zero traffic. Under these conditions, we
show that the heavy-traffic scaled queue length is given by
$\left(1-\frac{1}{2n}\right)||\sigma||^2$, where $\sigma$ is the vector of the
standard deviations of arrivals to each port in the heavy-traffic limit. In the
special case of uniform Bernoulli arrivals, the corresponding formula is given
by $\left(n-\frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{2n}\right)$. The result shows that the
heavy-traffic scaled queue length has optimal scaling with respect to $n,$ thus
settling one version of an open conjecture; in fact, it is shown that the
heavy-traffic queue length is at most within a factor of two from the optimal.
We then consider certain asymptotic regimes where the load of the system scales
simultaneously with the number of ports. We show that the MaxWeight algorithm
has optimal queue length scaling behavior provided that the arrival rate
approaches capacity sufficiently fast.

maps are defined as stable fold maps such that the sets of all the singular
values are concentric spheres and it was first introduced in 2012--2014. The
author studied algebraic and differential topological properties of such maps
and their manifolds and constructed explicit round fold maps. For example, the
author succeeded in constructing such maps on manifolds regarded as the total
spaces of bundles over smooth homotopy spheres by noticing that smooth homotopy
spheres admit round fold maps whose singular sets are connected and more
generally, new such maps on manifolds regerded as the total space of circle
bundles over another manifold admitting a round fold map. In this paper, as an
advanced work, we construct new explicit round fold maps on manifolds regarded
as the total spaces of bundles such that the fibers are closed smooth manifolds
and that the structure groups are linear and more general bundles over a

translational and rotational diffusion, especially the translational-rotational

deviate from the simple proportionality to $Q^2$. The coefficients $f_{lm}(Q)$

randomized behavioral experiments on the popular crowdsourcing platform Amazon
Mechanical Turk with the goal of understanding when, where, and why PBPs help,
identifying properties of the payment, payment structure, and the task itself
that make them most effective. We provide examples of tasks for which PBPs do
improve quality. For such tasks, the effectiveness of PBPs is not too sensitive
to the threshold for quality required to receive the bonus, while the magnitude
of the bonus must be large enough to make the reward salient. We also present
examples of tasks for which PBPs do not improve quality. Our results suggest
that for PBPs to improve quality, the task must be effort-responsive: the task
must allow workers to produce higher quality work by exerting more effort. We
also give a simple method to determine if a task is effort-responsive a priori.
Furthermore, our experiments suggest that all payments on Mechanical Turk are,
to some degree, implicitly performance-based in that workers believe their work
may be rejected if their performance is sufficiently poor. Finally, we propose
a new model of worker behavior that extends the standard principal-agent model
from economics to include a worker's subjective beliefs about his likelihood of
being paid, and show that the predictions of this model are in line with our
experimental findings. This model may be useful as a foundation for theoretical
studies of incentives in crowdsourcing markets.

The adjustment made by this statistic may be decomposed into a sum of two
terms, interpreted as correcting respectively for the possible effect of
nuisance parameters and the deviation from standard normality of the signed
root likelihood ratio statistic itself. We show that the adjustment terms are
determined to second-order in the sample size by their means. Explicit
expressions are obtained for the leading terms in asymptotic expansions of
these means. These are easily calculated, allowing a simple way of quantifying
and interpreting the respective effects of the two adjustments, in particular
of the effect of a high dimensional nuisance parameter. Illustrations are given
for a number of examples, which provide theoretical insight to the effect of
nuisance parameters on parametric inference. The analysis provides a
decomposition of the mean of the signed root statistic involving two terms: the
first has the property of taking the same value whether there are no nuisance
parameters or whether there is an orthogonal nuisance parameter, while the
second is zero when there are no nuisance parameters. Similar decompositions
are discussed for the Bartlett correction factor of the likelihood ratio
statistic, and for other asymptotically standard normal pivots.

to organize protests and express dissatisfaction with their governments. This
fact has not gone unnoticed, with governments clamping down on this medium via
censorship, and circumvention researchers working to stay one step ahead.
  In this paper, we explore a promising new avenue for covert channels:
real-time strategy-video games. Video games have two key features that make
them attractive cover protocols for censorship circumvention. First, due to the
popularity of gaming platforms such as Steam, there are a lot of different
video games, each with their own protocols and server infrastructure. Users of
video-game-based censorship-circumvention tools can therefore diversify across
many games, making it difficult for the censor to respond by simply blocking a
single cover protocol. Second, games in the same genre have many common
features and concepts. As a result, the same covert channel framework can be
easily adapted to work with many different games. This means that circumvention
tool developers can stay ahead of the censor by creating a diverse set of tools
and by quickly adapting to blockades created by the censor.
  We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing our coding
scheme over two real-time strategy-games (including a very popular
closed-source game). We evaluate the security of our system prototype -- Castle
-- by quantifying its resilience to a censor-adversary, its similarity to real
game traffic, and its ability to avoid common pitfalls in covert channel
design. We use our prototype to demonstrate that our approach can provide
throughput which is amenable to transfer of textual data, such at e-mail, SMS
messages, and tweets, which are commonly used to organize political actions.

such data are not available for most third and higher-row elements. This
introduces an uncertainty that is especially acute for photoionized clouds,
where the low temperatures mean that DR occurs energetically through very
low-lying autoionizing states. This paper discusses S$^{2+} \rightarrow$ S$^+$
DR, the process that is largely responsible for establishing the [S~III]/[S~II]
ratio in nebulae. We derive an empirical rate coefficient using a novel method
for second-row ions, which do have accurate data. Photoionization models are
used to reproduce the [O~III] / [O~II] / [O~I] / [Ne~III] intensity ratios in

semimartingales by introducing a suitable spectral analysis for the quadratic
variation operator. Motivated by high-dimensional complex systems typically
found in interest rate markets, we investigate correlation in high-dimensional
high-frequency data generated by continuous semimartingales. In contrast to the
traditional PCA methodology, the directions of large variations are not
deterministic, but rather they are bounded variation adapted processes which
maximize quadratic variation almost surely. This allows us to reduce
dimensionality from high-dimensional semimartingale systems in terms of
quadratic covariation rather than the usual covariance concept.
  The proposed methodology allows us to investigate space-time data driven by
multi-dimensional latent semimartingale state processes. The theory is applied
to discretely-observed stochastic PDEs which admit finite-dimensional
realizations. In particular, we provide consistent estimators for
finite-dimensional invariant manifolds for Heath-Jarrow-Morton models. More
importantly, components of the invariant manifold associated to volatility and
drift dynamics are consistently estimated and identified. The proposed
methodology is illustrated with both simulated and real data sets.

confirmed around the M31 galaxy and around the Centaurus A galaxy, while the
Milky Way also sports a plane of satellites. It has been argued that such an
alignment of satellites on vast planes is unexpected in the standard
({\Lambda}CDM) model of cosmology if not even in contradiction to its generic
predictions. Guided by {\Lambda}CDM numerical simulations, which suggest that
satellites are channeled towards hosts along the axis of the slowest collapse
as dictated by the ambient velocity shear tensor, we re-examine the planes of
local satellites systems within the framework of the local shear tensor derived
from the Cosmicflows-2 dataset. The analysis reveals that the Local Group and
Centaurus A reside in a filament stretched by the Virgo cluster and compressed
by the expansion of the Local Void. Four out of five thin planes of satellite
galaxies are indeed closely aligned with the axis of compression induced by the
Local Void. Being the less massive system, the moderate misalignment of the
Milky Way's satellite plane can likely be ascribed to its greater
susceptibility to tidal torques, as suggested by numerical simulations. The
alignment of satellite systems in the local universe with the ambient shear
field is thus in general agreement with predictions of the {\Lambda}CDM model.

that may trace the astrophysical sources of the IGRB: SDSS-DR6 QSOs, the
SDSS-DR8 Main Galaxy Sample, Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in the SDSS catalog,
2MASS galaxies, and radio NVSS galaxies. The benefit of correlating the
Fermi-LAT signal with catalogs of objects at various redshifts is to provide
tomographic information on the IGRB which is crucial to separate the various
contributions and to clarify its origin. We observe a significant (>3.5 sigma)
cross-correlation signal on angular scales smaller than 1 deg in the NVSS,
2MASS and QSO cases and, at lower statistical significance (~3.0 sigma), with
SDSS galaxies. These results are robust against the choice of the statistical
estimator, estimate of errors, map cleaning procedure and instrumental effects.
Finally, we test the hypothesis that the IGRB observed by Fermi-LAT originates
from the summed contributions of three types of unresolved extragalactic
sources: BL Lacs, FSRQs and Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGs). We find that a model
in which the IGRB is mainly produced by SFGs ($72^{+23}_{-37}$% with 2 sigma

fit to the data. We also consider a possible contribution from Misaligned

knowledge of the power spectrum over a large range including very nonlinear
scales. While this level of accuracy is easily obtained in the linear regime
with perturbation theory, it represents a serious challenge for small scales
where numerical simulations are required. In this paper we quantify the
precision of present-day $N$-body methods, identifying main potential error
sources from the set-up of initial conditions to the measurement of the final
power spectrum. We directly compare three widely used $N$-body codes, Ramses,
Pkdgrav3, and Gadget3 which represent three main discretisation techniques: the
particle-mesh method, the tree method, and a hybrid combination of the two. For
standard run parameters, the codes agree to within one percent at $k\leq1$
$h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and to within three percent at $k\leq10$ $h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$.
We also consider the bispectrum and show that the reduced bispectra agree at
the sub-percent level for $k\leq 2$ $h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$. In a second step, we
quantify potential errors due to initial conditions, box size, and resolution
using an extended suite of simulations performed with our fastest code
Pkdgrav3. We demonstrate that the simulation box size should not be smaller
than $L=0.5$ $h^{-1}\rm Gpc$ to avoid systematic finite-volume effects (while
much larger boxes are required to beat down the statistical sample variance).
Furthermore, a maximum particle mass of $M_{\rm p}=10^{9}$ $h^{-1}\rm
M_{\odot}$ is required to conservatively obtain one percent precision of the
matter power spectrum. As a consequence, numerical simulations covering large
survey volumes of upcoming missions such as DES, LSST, and Euclid will need
more than a trillion particles to reproduce clustering properties at the
targeted accuracy.

constraining, but the vast majority are focused on cases where the final-stage
visible decays are prompt. Scenarios featuring superparticles with
detector-scale lifetimes have therefore remained a tantalizing possibility for
sub-TeV SUSY, since explicit limits are relatively sparse. Nonetheless, the
extremely low backgrounds of the few existing searches for collider-stable and
displaced new particles facilitates recastings into powerful long-lived
superparticle searches, even for models for which those searches are highly
non-optimized. In this paper, we assess the status of such models in the
context of baryonic R-parity violation, gauge mediation, and mini-split SUSY.
We explore a number of common simplified spectra where hadronic decays can be
important, employing recasts of LHC searches that utilize different detector
systems and final-state objects. The LSP/NLSP possibilities considered here
include generic colored superparticles such as the gluino and light-flavor
squarks, as well as the lighter stop and the quasi-degenerate Higgsino
multiplet motivated by naturalness. We find that complementary coverage over
large swaths of mass and lifetime is achievable by superimposing limits,
particularly from CMS's tracker-based displaced dijet search and heavy stable
charged particle searches. Adding in prompt searches, we find many cases where
a range of sparticle masses is now excluded from zero lifetime to infinite
lifetime with no gaps. In other cases, the displaced searches furnish the only
extant limits at any lifetime.

Our analysis focuses on stellar rotation curves derived by fitting stellar
template spectra to the galaxy spectra binned along the slit. In this way, we
are able to obtain accurate rotation velocity measurements for a factor of 2
more galaxies than possible with the Halpha line. Galaxies with high atomic gas
mass fractions are the most dark-matter dominated galaxies in our sample and
have dark matter halo density profiles that are well fit by Navarro, Frenk &
White profiles with an average concentration parameter of 10. The inner slopes
and of the rotation curves correlate more strongly with stellar population age
than with galaxy mass or structural parameters. At fixed stellar mass, the
rotation curves of more actively star-forming galaxies have steeper inner
slopes than less actively star-forming galaxies. The ratio between the galaxy
specific angular momentum and the total specific angular momentum of its dark
matter halo, R_j, correlates strongly with galaxy mass, structure and gas
content. Low mass, disk-dominated galaxies with atomic gas mass fractions
greater than 20% have median values of R_j of around 1, but massive,

understood in a picture where gas inflows triggered by disk instabilities lead

distinct populations are a consequence of different stellar generations:
intra-cluster pollution episodes are required to produce the peculiar chemistry

have left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. To
constrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminium
abundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: NGC~1904, NGC~2808,
and NGC~362. The present investigation along with our previous analysis of M12
and M5 affords us the largest database of simultaneous determinations of Li and
Al abundances. Our results indicate that Li production has occurred in each of
the three clusters. In NGC~362 we detected an M12-like behaviour, with first
and second-generation stars sharing very similar Li abundances favouring a
progenitor that is able to produce Li, such as AGB stars. Multiple progenitor
types are possible in NGC~1904 and NGC~2808, as they possess both an
intermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars and
also an extreme population, that is enriched in Al but depleted in Li. A simple
dilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. Finally, the internal
Li variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element is
a function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relatively
metal-rich clusters are more adept at producing Li.

it is unclear whether the spectrum is fully produced by the photosphere or
whether a substantial part of the spectrum is added by processes far above the
photosphere. Here we make a detailed study of the $\gamma-$ray emission from
single pulse GRB110920A which has a spectrum that becomes extremely narrow
towards the end of the burst. We show that the emission can be interpreted as
Comptonisation of thermal photons by cold electrons in an unmagnetised outflow
at an optical depth of $\tau \sim 20$. The electrons receive their energy by a
local dissipation occurring close to the saturation radius. The main spectral
component of GRB110920A and its evolution is thus, in this interpretation,
fully explained by the emission from the photosphere including localised
dissipation at high optical depths.

functions for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology constrained by the observed

reachable set, defined as the set of states from which there exists a control,
despite the worst disturbance, that can drive the system into a set of target

configurations, depending on the application. Many Hamilton-Jacobi formulations
allow the computation of reachable sets; however, due to the exponential
complexity scaling in computation time and space, problems involving
approximately 5 dimensions become intractable. A number of methods that compute
an approximate solution exist in the literature, but these methods trade off
complexity for optimality. In this paper, we eliminate complexity-optimality
trade-offs for time-invariant decoupled systems using a decoupled
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation that enables the exact reconstruction of high

subsystems. Our formulation is compatible with existing numerical tools, and we
show the accuracy, computation benefits, and an application of our novel

instead of shielding the jet it speeds up the IC drag on it. Although a high

post selection can be considered a valid physical transformation (on
probability space) or not. We study the consequences of both answers set in a
device (theory) independent framework, based only on observed statistics. We
start with taking up post-selection as an assumption and model the same using
independent devices governed by Boolean functions. We establish analogy between
the post selection functions and the general probabilistic games in a two party
binary input-output scenario. As an observation, we categorize all possible
post-selection functions based on the effect on a uniform input probability
distribution. We find that post-selection can transform simple no signaling
probability distributions to signaling. Similarly, solving NP complete problems
is easy independent of classical or quantum computation (in particular we prove
that Post RP = NP). Finally, we demonstrate an instance of the violation of the
pigeon hole principle independent of underlying theory. As result of our theory
independent modeling we conclude that post-selection as an assumption adds
power to the underlying theory. In particular, quantum mechanics benefits more
with the post-selection assumption, only because it admits a more general set
of allowed probabilities as compared to the local hidden variable model.
Without the assumption we associate a device independent efficiency factor to
quantify the cost of post selection. Our study shows that in the real world
post-selection is not efficient enough to be of any advantage. But from an
adversarial perspective it is still of significance. As an application, we
obtain robust bounds on faking the bell violation in terms of minimum
efficiency required using post selection.

mutation and selection. Assuming small mutation rates, evolution can be
predicted based solely on the fitness differences between phenotypes.
Predicting an evolutionary process under varying mutation rates as well as
varying fitness is still an open question. Experimental procedures, however, do
include these complexities along with fluctuating population sizes and
stochastic events such as extinctions. We investigate the mutational path
probabilities of systems having epistatic effects on both fitness and mutation
rates using a theoretical and computational framework. In contrast to previous
models, we do not limit ourselves to the typical strong selection, weak
mutation (SSWM)-regime or to fixed population sizes. Rather we allow epistatic
interactions to also affect mutation rates. This can lead to qualitatively
non-trivial dynamics. Pathways, that are negligible in the SSWM-regime, can
overcome fitness valleys and become accessible. This finding has the potential
to extend the traditional predictions based on the SSWM foundation and bring us
closer to what is observed in experimental systems.

these methods is to map the given high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional
space preserving certain properties of the initial data. There are two kinds of
techniques for this purpose. The first, projective methods, builds an explicit
linear projection from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional one.
On the other hand, the nonlinear methods utilizes nonlinear and implicit
mapping between the two spaces. In both cases, the methods considered in
literature have usually relied on computationally very intensive matrix
factorizations, frequently the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The
computational burden of SVD quickly renders these dimension reduction methods
infeasible thanks to the ever-increasing sizes of the practical datasets.
  In this paper, we present a new decomposition strategy, Reduced Basis
Decomposition (RBD), which is inspired by the Reduced Basis Method (RBM). Given
$X$ the high-dimensional data, the method approximates it by $Y \, T (\approx
X)$ with $Y$ being the low-dimensional surrogate and $T$ the transformation
matrix. $Y$ is obtained through a greedy algorithm thus extremely efficient. In
fact, it is significantly faster than SVD with comparable accuracy. $T$ can be
computed on the fly. Moreover, unlike many compression algorithms, it easily
finds the mapping for an arbitrary ``out-of-sample'' vector and it comes with
an ``error indicator'' certifying the accuracy of the compression. Numerical
results are shown validating these claims.

face huge challenges in designing novel operational geometries. Mono-pole and
quasi-mono-pole antennas are seen to be the most compact and easily incorporate
able solution for portable devices taking the advantages of printed circuit
board (PCB) techniques. Most antennas of such type have symmetrical structures.
It is possible to attain wider operating bandwidths by meeting symmetry
conditions while chopping the antenna into halves for a compact structure.
However, there is no generalized way of applying such a technique. The
presented paper addresses this issue by proposing a common feeding technique
that can be applied to any antenna which is miniaturized using its symmetrical
structure. The proposed technique enables feeding the halved structure to
achieve wider and better impedance matching than the reported full-size
antennas. The theory of characteristic modes is applied to quasi-mono-pole
structures to get an insight of the antennas mechanism. The radiation patterns
are also correlated with modal current distributions to understand the
radiation characteristics of the modified structure. Lastly, the method is
implemented on some example antennas to illustrate its potential.

sensor measurements. The need for observers is ubiquitous, with applications in
fields ranging from engineering to biology to economics. The most widely used
observer is the Kalman filter, which is known to be the optimal estimator of
the state when the noise is additive and Gaussian. Because its performance is
limited by the sensors to which it is paired, it is natural to seek an optimal
sensor for the Kalman filter. The problem is however not convex and, as a
consequence, many ad hoc methods have been used over the years to design
sensors. We show in this paper how to characterize and obtain the optimal
sensor for the Kalman filter. Precisely, we exhibit a positive definite
operator which optimal sensors have to commute with. We furthermore provide a
gradient flow to find optimal sensors, and prove the convergence of this
gradient flow to the unique minimum in a broad range of applications. This
optimal sensor yields the lowest possible estimation error for measurements
with a fixed signal to noise ratio. The results presented here also apply to
the dual problem of optimal actuator design.

equation in comoving coordinates, which is used to model the gravitational
evolution of dark matter in an expanding universe. However, these methods are
known to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late
times, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we
have performed a series of one- and two-dimensional ""Zel'dovich Pancake""
calculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC
can indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are
made. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution
function by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This
process is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,
as with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so
that its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the
high-density caustics - is small. The second modification is the introduction
of a particle remapping procedure that periodically re-expresses the dark
matter distribution function using a new set of particles. We describe a
remapping algorithm that is third-order accurate and adaptive in phase space.
This procedure prevents the accumulation of numerical errors in integrating the
particle trajectories from growing large enough to significantly degrade the
solution. Once both of these changes are made, PIC converges at second order on
the Zel'dovich Pancake problem, even at late times, after many caustics have
formed. Furthermore, the resulting scheme does not suffer from the unphysical,
small-scale ""clumping"" phenomenon known to occur on the Pancake problem when
the perturbation wave vector is not aligned with one of the Cartesian
coordinate axes.

increases fast for early contributions and then decelerates. We report on a

environmental consciousness. In some cases, people do not know what the right
behaviors are to protect the environment. Game engine has been used in the AEC
industry for visualization. However, it has barely been used in environmental
consciousness education, for example, what operation can reduce building energy
consumption, what items are recyclables. As social psychology studies show that
video game can influence human behavior, a good designed game should provide
the game player with right incentives and guide the users to make wiser choices
for better environmental protection. This paper discussed a method to use
serious game engines to educate the players the right actions that should be
taken under in different scenarios. These actions in real life will results in
a better environmental protection. The game proposed in this study is for
residential home operation. Other scenarios such as restaurant operation,
grocery store operations are discussed as expansion of this study. The game
players points will be calculated based on their performance on different
choices and when they surpass a certain level, different rewards will be gained
in order for them to adjust their current living style. The purpose of the game
is to raise the environmental consciousness among the game players and educate
them the right actions they can make to better protect the environment while
they are spending time on games.

describing the time evolution of the membrane potentials of a system of neurons

chemical and electrical synapses and leak currents. The system consists of
$\epsilon^{-2}$ neurons embedded in $[0,1)^2$, each spiking randomly according
to a point process with rate depending on both its membrane potential and
position. When neuron $i$ spikes, its membrane potential is reset to a resting
value while the membrane potential of $j$ is increased by a positive value
$\epsilon^2 a(i,j)$, if $i$ influences $j$. Furthermore, between consecutive
spikes, the system follows a deterministic motion due both to electrical
synapses and leak currents. The electrical synapses are involved in the
synchronization of neurons. For each pair of neurons $(i,j)$, we modulate this
synchronizing strength by $\epsilon^2 b(i,j)$, where $b(i,j)$ is a nonnegative
symmetric function. On the other hand, the leak currents inhibit the activity
of all neurons, attracting simultaneously their membrane potentials to the
resting value.
  In the main result of this paper is shown that the empirical distribution of
the membrane potentials converges, as the parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero, to
a probability density $\rho_t(u,r)$ which is proved to obey a non linear PDE of
Hyperbolic type.

state of vehicles in the deterministic limit corresponds to a unique
relationship between speeds and gaps in the proposed model, the traffic states
of vehicles dynamically span a two-dimensional region in the plane of speed
versus gap, due to the various randomizations. It is shown that the model is
able to well reproduce (i) the free flow, synchronized flow, jam as well as the
transitions among the three phases; (ii) the evolution features of disturbances
and the spatiotemporal patterns in a car-following platoon; (iii) the empirical
time series of traffic speed obtained from NGSIM data. Therefore, we argue that
a model can potentially reproduce the empirical and experimental features of

order to effect the decisions of others, is ubiquitous. Indeed, persuasive
communication has been estimated to account for almost a third of all economic
activity in the US. This paper examines persuasion through a computational
lens, focusing on what is perhaps the most basic and fundamental model in this
space: the celebrated Bayesian persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow. Here
there are two players, a sender and a receiver. The receiver must take one of a
number of actions with a-priori unknown payoff, and the sender has access to
additional information regarding the payoffs. The sender can commit to
revealing a noisy signal regarding the realization of the payoffs of various
actions, and would like to do so as to maximize her own payoff assuming a
perfectly rational receiver.
  We examine the sender's optimization task in three of the most natural input
models for this problem, and essentially pin down its computational complexity
in each. When the payoff distributions of the different actions are i.i.d. and
given explicitly, we exhibit a polynomial-time (exact) algorithm, and a
""simple"" $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm. Our optimal scheme for the i.i.d.
setting involves an analogy to auction theory, and makes use of Border's
characterization of the space of reduced-forms for single-item auctions. When
action payoffs are independent but non-identical with marginal distributions
given explicitly, we show that it is #P-hard to compute the optimal expected
sender utility. Finally, we consider a general (possibly correlated) joint
distribution of action payoffs presented by a black box sampling oracle, and
exhibit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) with a bi-criteria
guarantee. We show that this result is the best possible in the black-box model

Einstein-scalar gravities with weakened boundary conditions, and calculate the

this non-integrability problem is to impose boundary conditions; however, we
find the mass calculated in this way has many other problems. This implies the
macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the scalar hairy black holes should be
described by one more charge beside the mass, which we call a scalar charge. In
fact, the non-integrability of mass will always arise when the matter fields
have charges which is not associate to any diffeomorphisms of spacetime. We
find the mass becomes non-integrable just because Wald's formula is used in a
wrong way. Based on Wald's formula and the existence of the scalar charge, we
propose a new definition for mass, with the modification that we require the
variation of the Hamiltonian to have no contribution from the variation of the

$m_p/\mchi$. The distance to the last-scattering surface depends on
$Gm_p\mchi/\hbar c$, so published CMB observational limits on time variations
of the constants implicitly assume the time-independence of this quantity, as
well as assuming a flat-\lcdm~cosmological model. On the other hand,
low-redshift BAO, $H_0$ and baryon-mass-fraction measurements can be combined
with the \emph{shape} of the CMB spectrum to give information that is largely
independent of these assumptions. In particular we show that the
pre-recombination values of $G\mchi^2/\hbar c$, $m_p/\mchi$ and
$\alpha^2m_e/m_p$ are equal to their present values at a precision of
$\sim15\%$.

Transport Equation (BTE) in a hydrodynamically expanding background. The
expansion of the background composed of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is treated
within the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics. Spatial anisotropic
fluctuations with different geometry have been evolved through Boltzmann
equation. It is observed that the trace of such fluctuation survive the
evolution. Within the relaxation time approximation analytical results have
been obtained for the evolution of these anisotropies. Explicit relations
between fluctuations and transport coefficients have been derived. The mixing
of various Fourier (or $k$) modes of the perturbations during the evolution of
the system has been explicitly demonstrated. This study is very useful in
understanding the presumption that the measured anisotropies in the data from
heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies imitate the initial state
effects. The evolution of correlation function for the perturbation in pressure
has been studied and shown that the initial correlation between two
neighbouring points in real space evolves to a constant value at later time
which gives rise to Dirac delta function for the correlation function in
Fourier space. The power spectrum of the fluctuation in thermodynamic
quantities (like temperature estimated in this work) can be connected to the
fluctuation in transverse momentum of the thermal hadrons measured
experimentally. The bulk viscous coefficient of the QGP has been estimated by
using correlations of pressure fluctuation with the help of Green-Kubo

composition and, through statistical-mechanics and graph-theory driven
analysis, we unveil that the social network made of native and foreign-born
individuals plays a role in the evolution and in the diversification of trades.
Indeed, migrants naturally provide key information on policies and needs in
their native countries, hence allowing firm's holders to leverage transactional
costs of exports and duties. As a consequence, international trading is
affordable for a larger basin of firms and thus results in an increased number
of transactions, which, in turn, implies a larger diversification of
international traded products. These results corroborate the novel scenario
depicted by ""Economical Complexity"", where the pattern of production and trade
of more developed countries is highly diversified. We also address a central
question in Economics, concerning the existence of a critical threshold for
migrants (within a given territorial district) over which they effectively
contribute to boost international trades: in our physically-driven picture,
this phenomenon corresponds to the emergence of a phase transition and,
tackling the problem from this perspective, results in a novel successful
quantitative route. Finally, we can infer that the pattern of interaction
between native and foreign-born population exhibits small-world features as
small diameter, large clustering, and weak ties working as optimal cut-edge, in
complete agreement with findings in ""Social Complexity"".

an energy cost function. The idea is that the generators define the qualitative
dynamics, by showing which transformations are possible, while the energy
patterns and cost function specify the long-term probability $\pi$ of any

finite set of rules which (i) has the same qualitative transition system as the

continuous-time Markov chain of which $\pi$ is the unique fixed point. The
construction relies on the use of site graphs and a technique of `growth
policy' for quantitative rule refinement which is of independent interest. This
division of labour between the qualitative and long-term quantitative aspects
of the dynamics leads to intuitive and concise descriptions for realistic
models (see the examples in S4 and S5). It also guarantees thermodynamical
consistency (AKA detailed balance), otherwise known to be undecidable, which is
important for some applications. Finally, it leads to parsimonious

that posits that the Local Sheet is descending at 259 km/s toward the south

185 km/s toward the Virgo Cluster. With the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology an

Void to be impressively large and empty. Small residuals from the published

Exact numerical simulations allow the investigation of the wavefield-spot
interaction beyond first order perturbation theory. The interaction of the
axisymmetric modes with the starspot is strongly nonlinear. As mode frequency
increases, the frequency shifts for radial modes exceed the value predicted by
linear theory, while the shifts for the $\ell=2, m=0$ modes are smaller than
predicted by linear theory, with avoided-crossing-like patterns forming between
the $m=0$ and $m=1$ mode frequencies. The nonlinear behavior increases with
increasing spot amplitude and/or decreasing depth. Linear theory still
reproduces the correct shifts for nonaxisymmetric modes. In the nonlinear
regime the mode eigenfunctions are not pure spherical harmonics, but rather a
mixture of different spherical harmonics. This mode mixing, together with the
frequency changes, may lead to misidentification of the modes in the observed
acoustic power spectra.

symmetry of the gravitational dynamics to derive explicit expressions that hold
beyond the perturbative regime, including both the large-scale Kaiser effect
and the small-scale fingers-of-god effects. We explicitly check these
relations, both perturbatively, for the lowest-order version that applies to
the bispectrum, and nonperturbatively, for all orders but for the
one-dimensional dynamics. Using a large ensemble of $N$-body simulations, we
find that our squeezed bispectrum relation is valid to better than $20\%$ up to
$1h$Mpc$^{-1}$, for both the monopole and quadrupole at $z=0.35$, in a
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Additional simulations done for the Einstein-de Sitter
background suggest that these discrepancies mainly come from the breakdown of
the approximate symmetry of the gravitational dynamics. For practical
applications, we introduce a simple ansatz to estimate the new derivative terms
in the relation using only observables. Although the relation holds worse after
using this ansatz, we can still recover it within $20\%$ up to $1h$Mpc$^{-1}$,
at $z=0.35$ for the monopole. On larger scales, $k = 0.2 h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
it still holds within the statistical accuracy of idealized simulations of

photospheric abundances. This coronal-to-photospheric abundance ratio, commonly
called the FIP bias, is typically 1 for element with a high-FIP (> 10 eV). We
have used EIS spectroscopic observations made on 2007 March 13 and 14 over an
~24 hour period to characterize abundance variations in plumes and interplumes.
To assess their elemental composition, we have used a differential emission

observed plasma. We have used lines from ions of iron, silicon, and sulfur.
From these we have estimated the ratio of the iron and silicon FIP bias
relative to that for sulfur. From the results, we have created FIP-bias-ratio
maps. We find that the FIP-bias ratio is sometimes higher in plumes than in
interplumes and that this enhancement can be time dependent. These results may
help to identify whether plumes or interplumes contribute to the fast solar
wind observed in situ and may also provides constraints on the formation and
heating mechanisms of plumes.

selection function. Selection functions appear in diverse areas of mathematics
and computer science (especially game theory, proof theory and topology) but
the existing literature does not heavily emphasise the fact that the selection
monad is a CPS translation. In particular it has so far gone unnoticed that the
selection monad has a call/cc-like operator with interesting similarities and
differences to the usual call/cc, which we explore experimentally using
Haskell.
  Selection functions can be used whenever we find the intermediate result more
interesting than the final result. For example a SAT solver computes an
assignment to a boolean function, and then its continuation decides whether it
is a satisfying assignment, and we find the assignment itself more interesting
than the fact that it is or is not satisfying. In game theory we find the move
chosen by a player more interesting than the outcome that results from that
move. The author and collaborators are developing a theory of games in which
selection functions are viewed as generalised notions of rationality, used to
model players. By realising that strategic contexts in game theory are examples
of continuations we can see that classical game theory narrowly misses being in
CPS, and that a small change of viewpoint yields a theory of games that is
better behaved, and especially more compositional.

multipartite entanglement for mixed quantum states. Since the structure of
partial separability and multipartite entanglement is getting complicated if
the number of subsystems exceeds two, one can not expect the existence of an
ultimate scalar entanglement measure, which grasps even a small part of the
rich hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement, and some higher order
structure characterizing that is needed. In this paper we make some steps
towards this direction.
  First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability
classification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. Kokenyesi, Phys. Rev. A
86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that, mathematically, the structure of the
entanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different
kinds of partial separability, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of
the partitions of the subsystems. It turns also out that, physically, this
structure is related to the LOCC convertibility: If a state from a class can be
mapped into another one, then that class can be found higher in the hierarchy.
  Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that
a given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of
entanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement
classes. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and
propose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite
generalization of the entanglement of formation based on the entanglement
entropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability. The
multipartite monotonicity shown by this set of measures motivates us to
consider the measures to be the different manifestations of some ""unified""
notion of entanglement.

language. The two basic operations of a monoidal category, namely categorical
composition and tensor product, correspond roughly to sequential and
simultaneous composition of games. This leads to a compositional theory in
which we can reason about properties of games in terms of corresponding
properties of the component parts. In particular, we give a definition of Nash
equilibrium which is recursive on the causal structure of the game.
  The key technical idea in this paper is the use of continuation passing style
for reasoning about the future consequences of players' choices, closely based
on applications of selection functions in game theory. Additionally, the clean

crystallizes in the body-centered tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure (space

EuCu1.82Sb2. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is indicated from the \chi(T),
Cp(T), and \rho(T) data for both EuCu2As2 (T_N = 17.5 K) and EuCu1.82Sb2 (T_N =
5.1 K). In EuCu1.82Sb2, the ordered-state \chi(T) and M(H) data suggest either
a collinear A-type AFM ordering of Eu+2 spins S=7/2 or a planar noncollinear
AFM structure, with the ordered moments oriented in the tetragonal ab plane in
either case. This ordered-moment orientation for the A-type AFM is consistent
with calculations with magnetic dipole interactions. The anisotropic \chi(T)
and isothermal M(H) data for EuCu2As2, also containing Eu+2 spins S=7/2,
strongly deviate from the predictions of molecular field theory for collinear
AFM ordering and the AFM structure appears to be both noncollinear and
noncoplanar.

rolls from close to a maximum of its potential (i.e. the 'hilltop') towards its
minimum. When the inflaton potential is associated with a phase transition,
possible topological defects produced during this phase transition, such as
domain walls, are efficiently diluted during inflation. It is typically assumed
that they also do not reform after inflation, i.e. that the inflaton field
stays on its side of the 'hill', finally performing damped oscillations around
the minimum of the potential. In this paper we study the linear and the
non-linear phases of preheating after hilltop inflation. We find that the
fluctuations of the inflaton field during the tachyonic oscillation phase grow
strong enough to allow the inflaton field to form regions in position space
where it crosses 'over the top of the hill' towards the 'wrong vacuum'. We
investigate the formation and behaviour of these overshooting regions using
lattice simulations: Rather than durable domain walls, these regions form
oscillon-like structures (i.e. localized bubbles that oscillate between the two
vacua) which should be included in a careful study of preheating in hilltop
inflation.

accelerating force from the toroidal electric field exceeds the collisional
drag force due to Coulomb collisions with the background plasma. In ITER,
disruptions are expected to generate REs mainly through knock-on collisions,
where enough momentum can be transferred from existing runaways to slow
electrons to transport the latter beyond a critical momentum, setting off an
avalanche of REs. Since knock-on runaways are usually scattered off with a
significant perpendicular component of the momentum with respect to the local
magnetic field direction, these particles are highly magnetized. Consequently,
the momentum dynamics require a full 3-D kinetic description, since these
electrons are highly sensitive to the magnetic non-uniformity of a toroidal
configuration. A bounce-averaged knock-on source term is derived. The
generation of REs from the combined effect of Dreicer mechanism and knock-on
collision process is studied with the code LUKE, a solver of the 3-D linearized
bounce-averaged relativistic electron Fokker-Planck equation, through the
calculation of the response of the electron distribution function to a constant
parallel electric field. This work shows that the avalanche effect can be
important even in non-disruptive scenarios. RE formation through knock-on
collisions is found to be strongly reduced when taking place off the magnetic
axis, since trapped electrons cannot contribute to the RE population. The
relative importance of the avalanche mechanism is investigated as a function of
the key parameters for RE formation; the plasma temperature and the electric
field strength. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the simulations show
that in low temperature and E-field knock-on collisions are the dominant source
of REs and can play a significant role for RE generation, including in
non-disruptive scenarios.

presence of unknown interferences and noise considering the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio. It is known that the problem of
adapting the transmit and receive filters of the users to maximize the sum rate
with a sum transmit power constraint is non-convex. Our novel approach is to
formulate the sum rate maximization problem as an equivalent multi-convex
optimization problem by adding two sets of auxiliary variables. An iterative
algorithm which alternatingly adjusts the system variables and the auxiliary
variables is proposed to solve the multi-convex optimization problem. The
proposed algorithm is applied to a downlink cellular scenario consisting of
several cells each of which contains a base station serving several mobile
stations. We examine the two cases, with or without several half-duplex
amplify-and-forward relays assisting the transmission. A sum power constraint
at the base stations and a sum power constraint at the relays are assumed.
Finally, we show that the proposed multi-convex formulation of the sum rate
maximization problem is applicable to many other wireless systems in which the
estimated data symbols are multi-affine functions of the system variables.

mixed-valence state Ni$^{(3-\delta)+}$ and Ni$^{(3+\delta)+}$, though agreement
has not been reached on the precise value of $\delta$ (e.g. for NdNiO$_3$,
$\delta=0.0$ and $\delta=0.29$ were reported). Also, the magnetic ground state
is not yet clear: collinear and non-collinear Ni-O magnetic structures have
been proposed to explain neutron diffraction and soft X-ray resonant
sccattering results in these compounds, and more recently a canted
antiferromagnetic spin arrangement was proposed on the basis of magnetic
susceptibility measurements. This scenario is reminiscent of the situation in
the half-doped manganites.
  In order to gain insight into the ground state of these compounds, we studied
the magnetic excitations of some of the different phases proposed, using a
localized spin model for a simplified spin chain which could describe these

intermediate phases in the classical case. We then explore the quantum ground
state indirectly, calculating the spin excitations obtained for each phase,
using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation and the linear spin-wave

predict differences in the magnon spectrum which would allow to distinguish

After that, the sample splits evenly between galaxies forming stars within a

larger sample should be analyzed in the same way to set precise limits on the

morphological analysis revealed that ~50% of our massive objects are
bulge-dominated, and almost all MS galaxies with a relevant bulge component

with (100) and (110) crystallographic orientations are studied at a constant
zero pressure by the molecular dynamics (MD) method with a many-body
interatomic interaction potential obtained in the embedded atom model. It is
shown that after relaxation the cubic lattices become tetragonal ($bct$ and
$fct$), and for the metastable $fct$ films the linear coefficients of thermal
expansion in the film plane have a negative value in a wide temperature range.
The total and local vibrational density of states (VDOS) polarized along the
$x,y,z$ axes is calculated for the surface and interior layers of $bct$ and
$fct$ Zr films as a function of the temperature. It is shown that the
peculiarities of the behavior of the vibrational density of states of surface
atomic layers manifest themselves in the anisotropy of the changes of the film
lattice parameters with temperature variation. A decrease in the lattice
parameters with increasing temperature is observed in the directions where
there occurs a softening of the local vibrational modes.

  Approach","17 pages, 2 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The non--mesonic weak decay of double--$\Lambda$ hypernuclei is studied
within a microscopic diagrammatic approach. Besides the nucleon--induced
mechanism, $\Lambda N\to nN$, widely studied in single--$\Lambda$ hypernuclei,
additional hyperon--induced mechanisms, $\Lambda \Lambda\to \Lambda n$,
$\Lambda \Lambda\to \Sigma^0 n$ and $\Lambda \Lambda\to \Sigma^-p$, are
accessible in double--$\Lambda$ hypernuclei and are investigated here. As in
previous works on single--$\Lambda$ hypernuclei, we adopt a nuclear matter
formalism extended to finite nuclei via the local density approximation and a
one--meson exchange weak transition potential (including the ground state
pseudoscalar and vector octets mesons) supplemented by correlated and
uncorrelated two--pion--exchange contributions. The weak decay rates are
evaluated for hypernuclei in the region of the experimentally accessible light
hypernuclei $^{10}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be and $^{13}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$B. Our
predictions are compared with a few previous evaluations. The rate for the
$\Lambda \Lambda\to \Lambda n$ decay is dominated by $K$--, $K^*$-- and
$\eta$--exchange and turns out to be about 2.5\% of the free $\Lambda$ decay
rate, $\Gamma_{\Lambda}^{\rm free}$, while the total rate for the $\Lambda
\Lambda\to \Sigma^0 n$ and $\Lambda \Lambda\to \Sigma^- p$ decays, dominated by
$\pi$--exchange, amounts to about 0.25\% of $\Gamma_{\Lambda}^{\rm free}$. The
experimental measurement of these decays would be essential for the beginning
of a systematic study of the non--mesonic decay of strangeness $-2$
hypernuclei. This field of research could also shed light on the possible
existence and nature of the $H$--dibaryon.

there is no coalgebra in the category of pointed sets whose comodules are

  Geophysical Research, Space Physics",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections are the manifestation of solar
transient eruptions, which can significantly modify the plasma and magnetic
conditions in the heliosphere. They are often preceded by a shock, and a
magnetic flux rope is detected in situ in a third to half of them. The main aim
of this study is to obtain the best quantitative shape for the flux rope axis
and for the shock surface from in situ data obtained during spacecraft
crossings of these structures. We first compare the orientation of the flux
ropes axes and shock normals obtained from independent data analyses of the
same events, observed in situ at 1AU from the Sun. Then, we carry out an
original statistical analysis of axes/shock normals by deriving the statistical
distributions of their orientations. We fit the observed distributions using
the distributions derived from several synthetic models describing these
shapes. We show that the distributions of axis/shock orientations are very
sensitive to their respective shape. One classical model, used to analyze
interplanetary imager data, is incompatible with the in situ data. Two other
models are introduced, for which the results for axis and shock normals lead to
very similar shapes; the fact that the data for MCs and shocks are independent
strengthen this result. The model which best fit all the data sets has an
ellipsoidal shape with similar aspect ratio values for all the data sets. These
derived shapes for the flux rope axis and shock surface have several potential
applications. First, these shapes can be used to construct a consistent ICME
model. Second, these generic shapes can be used to develop a quantitative model
to analyze imager data, as well as constraining the output of numerical
simulations of ICMEs. Finally, they will have implications for space weather
forecasting, in particular for forecasting the time arrival of ICMEs at the
Earth.

Our analysis is done using the Leclair-Mussardo formula for finite-volume
correlators, and knowledge of the exact infinite-volume form factors. We

$>1 Tb/in^2$ and circumvents many of the challenges associated with
conventional granular media technology. Instead of recording a bit on an
ensemble of random grains, BPM uses an array of lithographically defined
isolated magnetic islands, each of which stores one bit. Fabrication of BPM is
viewed as the greatest challenge for its commercialization. In this article we
describe a BPM fabrication method which combines e-beam lithography, directed
self-assembly of block copolymers, self-aligned double patterning, nanoimprint
lithography, and ion milling to generate BPM based on CoCrPt alloys. This
combination of fabrication technologies achieves feature sizes of $<10 nm$,
significantly smaller than what conventional semiconductor nanofabrication
methods can achieve. In contrast to earlier work which used hexagonal
close-packed arrays of round islands, our latest approach creates BPM with
rectangular bitcells, which are advantageous for integration with existing hard
disk drive technology. The advantages of rectangular bits are analyzed from a
theoretical and modeling point of view, and system integration requirements
such as servo patterns, implementation of write synchronization, and providing
for a stable head-disk interface are addressed in the context of experimental
results. Optimization of magnetic alloy materials for thermal stability,
writeability, and switching field distribution is discussed, and a new method
for growing BPM islands on a patterned template is presented. New recording
results at $1.6 Td/in^2$ (teradot/inch${}^2$, roughly equivalent to $1.3
Tb/in^2$) demonstrate a raw error rate $<10^{-2}$, which is consistent with the
recording system requirements of modern hard drives. Extendibility of BPM to
higher densities, and its eventual combination with energy assisted recording
are explored.
