Fernando","On globally defined semianalytic sets","32 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we present the concept of $C$-semianalytic subset of a real
analytic manifold and more generally of a real analytic space. $C$-semianalytic
sets can be understood as the natural generalization to the semianalytic
setting of global analytic sets introduced by Cartan ($C$-analytic sets for
short). More precisely $S$ is a $C$-semianalytic subset of a real analytic
space $(X,{\mathcal O}_X)$ if each point of $X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such
that $S\cap U$ is a finite boolean combinations of global analytic equalities
and strict inequalities on $X$. By means of paracompactness $C$-semianalytic
sets are the locally finite unions of finite boolean combinations of global
analytic equalities and strict inequalities on $X$.
  The family of $C$-semianalytic sets is closed under the same operations as
the family of semianalytic sets: locally finite unions and intersections,
complement, closure, interior, connected components, inverse images under
analytic maps, sets of points of dimension $k$, etc. although they are defined
involving only global analytic functions. In addition, we characterize
subanalytic sets as the images under proper analytic maps of $C$-semianalytic
sets.
  We prove also that the image of a $C$-semianalytic set $S$ under a proper
holomorphic map between Stein spaces is again a $C$-semianalytic set. The
previous result allows us to understand better the structure of the set $N(X)$
of points of non-coherence of a $C$-analytic subset $X$ of a real analytic
manifold $M$. We provide a global geometric-topological description of $N(X)$
inspired by the corresponding local one for analytic sets due to
Tancredi-Tognoli (1980), which requires complex analytic normalization. As a
consequence it holds that $N(X)$ is a $C$-semianalytic set of dimension
$\leq\dim(X)-2$.

allowing density waves to propagate through the suspension.

management targets derived from a non-spatial harvest model. Here, we extended
the Schaefer model, a conventional non-spatial harvest model that is widely
used in resource management, to a spatially-explicit harvest model by
integrating environmental heterogeneities, as well as species exchange between
patches. By comparing the maximum sustainable yields (MSY), one of the central
management targets in resource management, obtained from the spatially extended
model with that of the conventional model, we examined the effect of spatial
heterogeneity. When spatial heterogeneity exists, we found that the Schaefer
model tends to overestimate the MSY, implying potential for causing
overharvesting. In addition, by assuming a well-mixed population in the
heterogeneous environment, we showed analytically that the Schaefer model
always overestimate the MSY, regardless of the number of patches existing. The
degree of overestimation becomes significant when spatial heterogeneity is
marked. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of integrating the
spatial structure to conduct sustainable resource management.

(OCD) based on a generative model of cognition. The framework is constructed
using the new concept of a 'formal narrative' which is a sequence of cognitive
states inferred from sense data. First we propose that human cognition uses a
hierarchy of narratives to predict changes in the natural and social
environment. Each layer in the hierarchy represents a distinct 'view of the
world', but it also contributes to a global unitary perspective. Second, the
generative models used for cognitive inference can create new narratives from
those states already experienced by an individual. We hypothesise that when a
threat is recognised, narratives are generated as a cognitive model of possible
threat scenarios. Using this framework, we suggest that OCD arises from a
dysfunction in sub-surface levels of inference while the global unitary
perspective remains intact. The failure of inference is felt as the external
world being 'not just right', and its automatic correction by the perceptual
system is experienced as compulsion. Ordering and symmetry obsessions are the
effects of the perceptual system trying to achieve precise inference. Checking
behaviour arises because the security system attempts to finesse inference as
part of its protection behaviour. Similarly, fear of harm and distressing
thoughts occur because the failure of inference results in an indistinct view
of the past or the future. A wide variety of symptoms in OCD is thus explained
by a single dysfunction.

in a structured way. Specifically, we study the simplest sequence prediction
problems that are beyond the scope of what is learnable with standard recurrent
networks, algorithmically generated sequences which can only be learned by
models which have the capacity to count and to memorize sequences. We show that
some basic algorithms can be learned from sequential data using a recurrent

substrate is not in contact with the growing plate (except at its center), so
substrate interactions do not adversely affect the crystal growth. By
controlling the temperature and supersaturation around the crystal, we can
manipulate the resulting ice growth behavior in predictable ways, producing
morphologies spanning the full range from simple faceted hexagonal plates to
complex dendritic structures. We believe that the experimental apparatus
described here will allow unprecedented investigations of ice crystal growth
behaviors under controlled conditions, identifying and exploring robust
morphological features in detail. Such investigations will provide valuable
observational inputs for developing numerical modeling techniques that can
accurately reproduce the faceted and branched structures that frequently emerge

described. This may be either by confinement or by constriction. Closed
completely bound states are labeled by two integers: the number of
oscillations, $n$, and the number of times it winds the cylinder, $p$, the
latter a topological invariant. We examine the behavior of these states as the
length of the loop is increased by evaluating the energy, the conserved axial
torque and the contact force. The ground state for a given $p$ is the state
with $n=1$; a short loop with $p=1$ is an elliptic deformation of a parallel;
as its length increases it elongates along the cylinder axis, with two hairpin
ends. Excited states with $n\geq2$ and $p=1$ possess $n$-fold axial symmetry.
Short (long) loops possess energies $\approx p E_0$ ($nE_0$), with $E_0$ the
energy of a circular loop with same radius as the cylinder; in long loops the
axial torque vanishes. Confined bound excited states are initially unstable;
however, above a critical length each $n$-fold state becomes stable: the folded
hairpin cannot be unfolded. The ground state for each $p$ is also initially
unstable with respect to deformations rotating the loop off the surface into
the interior. A closed planar elastic curve aligned along the cylinder axis
making contact with the cylinder on its two sides is identified as the ground
state of a confined loop. Exterior bound states behave very differently, if
free to unbind, as signaled by the reversal in the sign of the contact force.
If $p=1$, all such states are unstable. If $p \geq 2$, however, a topological
obstruction to complete unbinding exists. If the loop is short, the bound state
with $p=2$ and $n=1$ provides a stable constriction of the cylinder, partially
unbinding as the length is increased. This motif could be relevant to an
understanding of the process of membrane fission mediated by dynamin rings.

to consider the effect of H2O clouds. We then extend our application of the
model to the exoplanet Kepler-7b and consider the effect of varying cloud
species, sedimentation efficiency, particle size, and cloud altitude. We show
that, depending on the observational filter, the largest possible shift of the
phase curve maximum will be 2-10 deg for a Jupiter-like planet, and up to 30
deg (0.08 in fractional orbital phase) for hot-Jupiter exoplanets at visible
wavelengths as a function of dayside cloud distribution with a uniformly

confirmation of, the recent optical phase-curve observations of Kepler-7b with
the Kepler space telescope. The average planetary albedo can vary between
0.1-0.6 for the 1300 cloud scenarios that were compared to the observations. We
observe that smaller particle size and increasing cloud altitude have a strong
effect on increasing albedo. In particular, we show that a set of models where

magneto-optical Kramers-Kronig analysis (MOKKA) that together allow extracting
the complex dielectric function for left- and right-handed circular
polarizations in a broad range of frequencies without actually generating
circularly polarized light. The experiment consists of measuring reflectivity
and Kerr rotation, or alternatively transmission and Faraday rotation, at
normal incidence using only standard broadband polarizers without retarders or
quarter-wave plates. In a common case, where the magneto-optical rotation is
small (below $\sim$ 0.2 rad), a fast measurement protocol can be realized,
where the polarizers are fixed at 45$^\circ$ with respect to each other. Apart
from the time-effectiveness, the advantage of this protocol is that it can be
implemented at ultra-high magnetic fields and in other situations, where an
\emph{in-situ} polarizer rotation is difficult. Overall, the proposed technique
can be regarded as a magneto-optical generalization of the conventional
Kramers-Kronig analysis of reflectivity on bulk samples and the Kramers-Kronig
constrained variational analysis of more complex types of spectral data. We
demonstrate the application of this method to the textbook semimetals bismuth
and graphite and also use it to obtain handedness-resolved magneto-absorption
spectra of graphene on SiC.

populations, but little is known about temporal protein fluctuations in a
single cell over extended times. We present here traces of protein copy number
measured in individual bacteria over multiple generations and investigate their
statistical properties, comparing them to previously measured population
snapshots. We find that temporal fluctuations in individual traces exhibit the
same universal features as those previously observed in populations. Scaled
fluctuations around the mean of each trace exhibit the same universal
distribution shape as found in populations measured under a wide range of
conditions and in two distinct microorganisms. Additionally, the mean and
variance of the traces over time obey the same quadratic relation. Analyzing
the temporal features of the protein traces in individual cells, reveals that
within a cell cycle protein content increases as an exponential function with a
rate that varies from cycle to cycle. This leads to a compact description of
the protein trace as a 3-variable stochastic process - the exponential rate,
the cell-cycle duration and the value at the cycle start - sampled once each
cell cycle. This compact description is sufficient to preserve the universal
statistical properties of the protein fluctuations, namely, the protein
distribution shape and the quadratic relationship between variance and mean.
Our results show that the protein distribution shape is insensitive to
sub-cycle intracellular microscopic details and reflects global cellular
properties that fluctuate between generations.

the scalability of a limited number of simulated vehicles to represent
different load aggregation points in the power system with different customer

benefits of EV aggregations behind-the-meter, where a time-of-use pricing
schema is used to understand the benefits to the owner when EV aggregations
shift load from high cost periods to lower cost periods. For the year of 2013,
we show a reduction of up to 24.8% in the monthly bill is possible. Then,
following a similar aggregation strategy, we show that EV aggregations decrease
their contribution to the system peak load by approximately 40% when charging
is controlled within arrival and departure times. Our results also show that it
could be expected to shift approximately 0.25kWh (~2.8%) of energy per
non-residential EV charging session from peak periods (12PM-6PM) to off-peak
periods (after 6PM) in Northern California for the year of 2013.

heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We investigate secure communications in a
two-tier downlink HetNet, which comprises one macrocell and several femtocells.
Each cell has multiple users and an eavesdropper attempts to wiretap the
intended macrocell user. Firstly, we consider an orthogonal spectrum allocation
strategy to eliminate co-channel interference, and propose the secrecy transmit
beamforming only operating in the macrocell (STB-OM) as a partial solution for
secure communication in HetNet. Next, we consider a secrecy-oriented
non-orthogonal spectrum allocation strategy and propose two cooperative STBs
which rely on the collaboration amongst the macrocell base station (MBS) and
the adjacent femtocell base stations (FBSs). Our first cooperative STB is the
STB sequentially operating in the macrocell and femtocells (STB-SMF), where the
cooperative FBSs individually design their STB matrices and then feed their
performance metrics to the MBS for guiding the STB in the macrocell. Aiming to
improve the performance of STB-SMF, we further propose the STB jointly designed
in the macrocell and femtocells (STB-JMF), where all cooperative FBSs feed
channel state information to the MBS for designing the joint STB. Unlike
conventional STBs conceived for broadcasting or interference channels, the
three proposed STB schemes all entail relatively sophisticated optimizations
due to QoS constraints of the legitimate users. In order to efficiently use
these STB schemes, the original optimization problems are reformulated and
convex optimization techniques, such as second-order cone programming and
semidefinite programming, are invoked to obtain the optimal solutions.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed STB schemes are highly
effective in improving the secrecy rate performance of HetNet.

substantial additional gains in scalability, without requiring any grid data,

off-shell signal strength is in the range 5.1-8.6, with an expected range of
6.7-11.0. In each case the range is determined by varying the unknown $gg\to

between half and twice the value of the known signal K-factor. Assuming the
relevant Higgs boson couplings are independent of the energy scale of the Higgs
production, a combination with the on-shell measurements yields an observed
(expected) 95\% CL upper limit on $\Gamma_H/\Gamma_H^{\mathrm{SM}}$ in the
range 4.5- -7.5 (6.5- -11.2) using the same variations of the background

general topology with multiple bidirectional unicast and multicast sessions is
shown to be decomposable into these canonical topologies to reduce the number
of transmissions without rate redundancy. As a result, the coding schemes
developed for the line, star and line-star topologies serve as building blocks
for the construction of more general coding schemes for all networks. The
proposed schemes are proved to be Real Time (RT) for wireless networks in the
sense that they achieve the minimal decoding delay. With a negligible size
header, these coding schemes are shown to be applicable to unsynchronized
networks, i.e., networks with random transmission delays. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of these schemes by extensive simulations. The
implementation of such coding schemes on a wireless network with random

  inventory systems",,,,,"math.PR math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dual-sourcing inventory systems, in which one supplier is faster (i.e.
express) and more costly, while the other is slower (i.e. regular) and cheaper,
arise naturally in many real-world supply chains. These systems are notoriously
difficult to optimize due to the complex structure of the optimal solution and
the curse of dimensionality, having resisted solution for over 40 years.
Recently, so-called Tailored Base-Surge (TBS) policies have been proposed as a
heuristic for the dual-sourcing problem. Under such a policy, a constant order
is placed at the regular source in each period, while the order placed at the
express source follows a simple order-up-to rule. Numerical experiments by
several authors have suggested that such policies perform well as the lead time
difference between the two sources grows large, which is exactly the setting in
which the curse of dimensionality leads to the problem becoming intractable.
However, providing a theoretical foundation for this phenomenon has remained a
major open problem.
  In this paper, we provide such a theoretical foundation by proving that a
simple TBS policy is indeed asymptotically optimal as the lead time of the
regular source grows large, with the lead time of the express source held
fixed. Our main proof technique combines novel convexity and lower-bounding
arguments, an explicit implementation of the vanishing discount factor approach
to analyzing infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, and ideas from the
theory of random walks and queues, significantly extending the methodology and
applicability of a novel framework for analyzing inventory models with large
lead times recently introduced by Goldberg and co-authors in the context of
lost-sales models with positive lead times.

non-parametric statistical modelling approach allowing us to capture a broad
range of activation kinetics, and use Bayesian parameter estimation to quantify
the uncertainty in the estimates of the kinetic parameters. We apply the model
to data from estrogen receptor (ER-{\alpha}) activation in the MCF-7 breast
cancer cell line. We use RNA polymerase II (pol-II) ChIP-Seq time course data
to characterise transcriptional activation and mRNA-Seq time course data to
quantify mature transcripts. We find that 11% of genes with a good signal in
the data display a delay of more than 20 minutes between completing
transcription and mature mRNA production. The genes displaying these long
delays are significantly more likely to be short. We also find a statistical
association between high delay and late intron retention in pre-mRNA data,
indicating significant splicing-associated production delays in many genes.

have emerged. For example, it has been shown that the performance of a device
can be significantly affected by several degrees of freedom when programming
the device; a common example being gauge selection. To date, no
experimentally-tested strategy exists to select the best programming
specifications. We developed a score function that can be calculated from a
number of readouts much smaller than the number of readouts required to find
the desired solution. We show how this performance estimator can be used to
guide, for example, the selection of the optimal gauges out of a pool of random
gauge candidates and how to select the values of parameters for which we have
no a priori knowledge of the optimal value. For the latter, we illustrate the
concept by applying the score function to set the strength of the parameter
intended to enforce the embedding of the logical graph into the hardware
architecture, a challenge frequently encountered in the implementation of
real-world problem instances. Since the harder the problem instances, the more
useful the strategies proposed in this work are, we expect the programming
strategies proposed to significantly reduce the time of future benchmark
studies and in help finding the solution of hard-to-solve real-world
applications implemented in the next generation of quantum annealing devices.

responsible for the explosion of a supernova actually tends to stall, we
propose a new energy source arising from our model for dark matter. Our earlier
model proposed that dark matter should consist of cm-large white dwarf-like
objects kept together by a skin separating two different sorts of vacua. These
dark matter balls or pearls will collect in the middle of any star throughout
its lifetime. At some stage during the development of a supernova the balls
will begin to take in neutrons and then other surrounding material. By passing
into a ball nucleons fall through a potential of order 10 MeV, causing a severe
production of heat - of order 10 foe for a solar mass of material eaten by the
balls. The temperature in the iron core will thereby be raised, splitting up
the iron into smaller nuclei. This provides a mechanism for reviving the shock
wave when it arrives and making the supernova explosion really occur. The onset
of the heating due to the dark matter balls would at first stop the collapse of
the supernova progenitor. This opens up the possibility of there being {\em
two} collapses giving two neutrino outbursts, as apparently seen in the
supernova SN1987A - one in Mont Blanc, and one 4 hours 43 minutes later in both
IMB and Kamiokande.

widely-used LLVM JIT compiler framework to compile SBML-specified models
directly into very fast native machine code for a variety of processors, making
it appropriate for solving very large models or multiple replicas of smaller
models. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML

increase the shortest path lengths of their own adversaries, who all attempt to
traverse a common network. We first establish results regarding the existence
of equilibria for DSPI games under both discrete and continuous interdiction

DSPI games, which leads to a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) with
non-shared constraints. While such a problem is computationally challenging in
general, we show that under continuous interdiction actions, a DSPI game can be
formulated as a linear complementarity problem and solved by Lemke's algorithm.
In addition, we present decentralized heuristic algorithms based on best
response dynamics for games under both continuous and discrete interdiction
strategies. Finally, we establish theoretical bounds on the worst-case
efficiency loss of equilibria in DSPI games, with such loss caused by the lack
of coordination among noncooperative interdictors, and use the decentralized

for pair-wise BS coordination. The key idea is that each BS cluster is formed
by using the 2nd-order Voronoi region, and the BS clusters are assigned to a
specific cluster pattern by using edge-coloring for a graph drawn by Delaunay
triangulation. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the BS
selection conflict problem is prevented, while selected users are guaranteed to
communicate with their two closest BSs in any irregular BS topology. With the
proposed coordination method, analytical expressions for the rate distribution
and the ergodic spectral efficiency are derived as a function of relevant
system parameters in a fixed irregular network model. In a random network model
with a homogeneous Poisson point process, a lower bound on the ergodic spectral
efficiency is characterized. Through system level simulations, the performance
of the proposed method is compared with that of conventional coordination
methods: dynamic clustering and static clustering. Our major finding is that,
when users are dense enough in a network, the proposed method provides the same
level of coordination benefit with dynamic clustering to edge users.

abundances, and electron density profiles broadly agree with those predicted by
Illustris. These results hint that the physics modules of Illustris are broadly
consistent with the observed properties of hot coronae around spiral galaxies.
However, a shortcoming of Illustris is that massive black holes, mostly
residing in giant ellipticals, give rise to powerful radio-mode AGN feedback,
which results in under luminous coronae for ellipticals.

interesting and yet still consistent with current data. We find that the halo
mass function in this model has a maximum 20% enhancement compared with the
$\Lambda$CDM predictions between $z=1$ and $z=0$. Because of the chameleon
mechanism which screens the deviation from standard gravity in dense
environments, haloes more massive than $10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ in this $f(R)$
model have very similar properties to haloes of similar mass in $\Lambda$CDM,
while less massive haloes, such as that of the Milky Way, can have steeper
inner density profiles and higher velocity dispersions due to their weaker
screening. The halo concentration is remarkably enhanced for low-mass haloes in
this model due to a deepening of the total gravitational potential. Contrary to
the naive expectation, the halo formation time $z_f$ is later for low-mass
haloes in this model, a consequence of these haloes growing faster than their
counterparts in $\Lambda$CDM at late times and the definition of $z_f$.
Subhaloes, especially those less massive than $10^{11}h^{-1}M_\odot$, are
substantially more abundant in this $f(R)$ model for host haloes less massive

make several novel, testable predictions. Most critically, we show that the
ultraviolet luminosity function of our simulated galaxies is consistent with
observations of high-z galaxy populations at the bright end of the luminosity
function (M$_{1600} \leq -17$), but at lower luminosities is essentially flat
rather than rising steeply, as has been inferred by Schechter function fits to
high-z observations, and has a clearly-defined lower limit in UV luminosity.
This behavior of the luminosity function is due to two factors: (i) the strong
dependence of the star formation rate on halo virial mass in our simulated
galaxy population, with lower-mass halos having systematically lower star
formation rates and thus lower UV luminosities; and (ii) the fact that halos
with virial masses below $\simeq 2 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ do not universally
contain stars, with the fraction of halos containing stars dropping to zero at
$\simeq 7 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$. Finally, we show that the brightest of our

near-infrared spectroscopy of the few very massive and passive galaxies
observed at $z>1.4$ available in literature, the differential evolution of this
population is estimated and calibrated with different stellar population
synthesis models to constrain H(z), including in the final error budget all
possible sources of systematic uncertainties (star formation history, stellar
metallicity, model dependencies). This analysis is able to extend significantly
the redshift range coverage with respect to present-day constraints, crossing
for the first time the limit at $z\sim1.75$. The new H(z) data are used to
estimate the gain in accuracy on cosmological parameters with respect to
previous measurements in two cosmological models, finding a small but
detectable improvement ($\sim$5 %) in particular on $\Omega_{M}$ and $w_{0}$.
Finally, a simulation of a Euclid-like survey has been performed to forecast
the expected improvement with future data. The provided constraints have been
obtained just with the cosmic chronometers approach, without any additional

ram pressure stripping of a cosmologically motivated population of galaxies in
isolated group and cluster environments. The galaxies and the host group and
cluster are composed of collisionless dark matter and hot gas initially in
hydrostatic equilibrium with the galaxy and host potentials. We show that the
rate at which gas is lost depends on the galactic and host halo mass. Using
synthetic X-ray observations, we evaluate the detectability of stripped
galactic coronae in real observations by stacking images on the known galaxy
centers. We find that coronal emission should be detected within $\sim 10$
arcsec, or $\sim 5$ kpc up to $\sim 2.3$ Gyr in the lowest (0.1 - 1.2 keV)
energy band. Thus the presence of observed coronae in cluster galaxies
significantly smaller than the hot X-ray halos of field galaxies indicates that
at least some gas removal occurs within cluster environments for recently
accreted galaxies. Finally, we evaluate the possibility that existing and
future X-ray cluster catalogs can be used in combination with optical galaxy
positions to detect galactic coronal emission via stacking analysis. We briefly
discuss the effects of additional physical processes on coronal survival, and
will address them in detail in future papers in this series.

accelerating expansion at a moderate redshift $z_{acc} \sim 0.7$. Clearly, it
is of great interest to directly measure this transition in a model-independent
way, without the assumption that GR is the correct theory of gravity. We
explore to what extent supernova (SN) luminosity distance measurements provide
evidence for such a transition: we show that, contrary to intuition, the
well-known ""turnover"" in the SN distance residuals $\Delta\mu$ relative to an
empty (Milne) model does not give firm evidence for such a transition within
the redshift range spanned by SN data. The observed turnover in that diagram is
predominantly due to the negative curvature in the Milne model, {\em not} the
deceleration predicted by $\Lambda$CDM and relatives. We show that there are
several advantages in plotting distance residuals against a flat,
non-accelerating model $(w = -1/3)$, and also remapping the $z-$axis to $u =
\ln(1+z)$; we outline a number of useful and intuitive properties of this
presentation. We conclude that there are significant complementarities between
SNe and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs): SNe offer high precision at low
redshifts and give good constraints on the net {\em amount} of acceleration
since $z \sim 0.7$, but are weak at constraining $z_{acc}$; while radial BAO
measurements are probably superior for placing direct constraints on $z_{acc}$.

SDSS-IV survey that will obtain resolved spectroscopy from 3600 $\AA$ to 10300
$\AA$ for a representative sample of over 10,000 nearby galaxies. In this
paper, we derive spatially resolved stellar population properties and radial
gradients by performing full spectral fitting of observed galaxy spectra from
P-MaNGA, a prototype of the MaNGA instrument. These data include spectra for
eighteen galaxies, covering a large range of morphological type. We derive age,
metallicity, dust and stellar mass maps, and their radial gradients, using high
spectral-resolution stellar population models, and assess the impact of varying
the stellar library input to the models. We introduce a method to determine
dust extinction which is able to give smooth stellar mass maps even in cases of
high and spatially non-uniform dust attenuation.
  With the spectral fitting we produce detailed maps of stellar population
properties which allow us to identify galactic features among this diverse
sample such as spiral structure, smooth radial profiles with little azimuthal
structure in spheroidal galaxies, and spatially distinct galaxy sub-components.
In agreement with the literature, we find the gradients for galaxies identified
as early-type to be on average flat in age, and negative (- 0.15 dex / R$_e$ )
in metallicity, whereas the gradients for late-type galaxies are on average
negative in age (- 0.39 dex / R$_e$ ) and flat in metallicity. We demonstrate
how different levels of data quality change the precision with which radial
gradients can be measured. We show how this analysis, extended to the large
numbers of MaNGA galaxies, will have the potential to shed light on galaxy
structure and evolution.

spectra centred on this redshifted line were taken with the PACS instrument

L_IR. We find significant differences between those galaxies presenting
[CII]/IR>2.5x10^-3 with respect to those showing lower ratios. In particular,
those with high ratios tend to have: (1) L_IR<10^11Lo; (2) cold dust

that the strength of the far-UV radiation fields (<G_O>) is main parameter
responsible for controlling the [CII]/IR ratio. It is possible that relatively
high <G_O> creates a positively charged dust grain distribution, impeding an
efficient photo-electric extraction of electrons from these grains to then
collisionally excite carbon atoms. Within the brighter IR population,
11<log(L_IR/Lo)<12, the low [CII]/IR ratio is unlikely to be modified by [CII]
self absorption or controlled by the presence of a moderately luminous AGN
(identified via the BPT diagram).

and High Contrast Imaging (HDS+HCI). For a planet located at a resolvable
angular distance from its host star, the starlight can be reduced up to several
orders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography. In addition, the
remaining starlight can be filtered out using high-dispersion spectroscopy,
utilizing the significantly different (or Doppler shifted) high-dispersion
spectra of the planet and star. In this way, HDS+HCI can in principle reach
contrast limits of ~1e-5 x 1e-5, although in practice this will be limited by
photon noise and/or sky-background.
  Methods: We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both
probing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight
reflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared
simulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument,
with the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an R=100,000 IFS. We
include realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric
transmission and emission. For the optical simulation we also assume R=100,000
IFS with adaptive optics capabilities at the E-ELT.
  Results: One night of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT at 4.8 um (d_lambda
= 0.07 um) can detect a planet orbiting alpha Cen A with a radius of R=1.5
R_earth and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of T_eq=300 K at a signal-to-noise
(S/N) of 5. In the optical, with a Strehl ratio performance of 0.3, reflected
light from an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri can
be detected at a S/N of 10 in the same time frame. Recently, first HDS+HCI
observations have shown the potential of this technique by determining the

image from a lowresolution (LR) input. Image priors are commonly learned to
regularize the otherwise seriously ill-posed SR problem, either using external
LR-HR pairs or internal similar patterns. We propose joint SR to adaptively
combine the advantages of both external and internal SR methods. We define two
loss functions using sparse coding based external examples, and epitomic
matching based on internal examples, as well as a corresponding adaptive weight
to automatically balance their contributions according to their reconstruction
errors. Extensive SR results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method over the existing state-of-the-art methods, and is also verified by our
subjective evaluation study.

processing addresses the coordination and safety of short atomic computations.
Heretofore, these two modes of operation existed in separate, stove-piped
systems. In this work, we attempt to fuse the two computational paradigms in a
single system called S-Store. In this way, S-Store can simultaneously
accommodate OLTP and streaming applications. We present a simple transaction
model for streams that integrates seamlessly with a traditional OLTP system. We
chose to build S-Store as an extension of H-Store, an open-source, in-memory,
distributed OLTP database system. By implementing S-Store in this way, we can
make use of the transaction processing facilities that H-Store already
supports, and we can concentrate on the additional implementation features that
are needed to support streaming. Similar implementations could be done using
other main-memory OLTP platforms. We show that we can actually achieve higher
throughput for streaming workloads in S-Store than an equivalent deployment in
H-Store alone. We also show how this can be achieved within H-Store with the
addition of a modest amount of new functionality. Furthermore, we compare
S-Store to two state-of-the-art streaming systems, Spark Streaming and Storm,
and show how S-Store matches and sometimes exceeds their performance while
providing stronger transactional guarantees.

The reduced spectra were fitted with a multicomponent model in order to isolate
the contributions of various continuum and emission-line components. We present
light curves of broad emission lines and the AGN continuum, and measurements of
the broad H-beta line widths in mean and root-mean square (rms) spectra. For
the most highly variable AGNs we also measured broad H-beta line widths and
velocity centroids from the nightly spectra. In four AGNs exhibiting the
highest variability amplitudes, we detect anticorrelations between broad H-beta
width and luminosity, demonstrating that the broad-line region ""breathes"" on
short timescales of days to weeks in response to continuum variations. We also
find that broad H-beta velocity centroids can undergo substantial changes in
response to continuum variations; in NGC 4593 the broad H-beta velocity shifted
by ~250 km/s over a one-month duration. This reverberation-induced velocity
shift effect is likely to contribute a significant source of confusion noise to
binary black hole searches that use multi-epoch quasar spectroscopy to detect
binary orbital motion. We also present results from simulations that examine
biases that can occur in measurement of broad-line widths from rms spectra due
to the contributions of continuum variations and photon-counting noise.

non-thermal and therefore a definition of temperature is not warranted. This is
due to the fact that our NUAOs do not see event horizons in the spacetime. More
specifically, the Minkowski vacuum state is perceived by our NUAOs as a
single-mode squeezed state as opposed to the two-mode squeezed state
characteristic of uniformly accelerating observers. Both single and two-mode
squeezed states are pure quantum states; however, tracing over degrees of
freedom in one of the modes of the two-mode squeezed state reduces the pure

redshifts ($0.028 < z < 0.18$). We compare the derived properties to global
properties derived from multi band imaging and 21 cm HI interferometry and
single dish observations, as well as archival optical SDSS spectra. Besides the
Lyman $\alpha$ line, the spectra contain a number of metal absorption features
allowing us to probe the kinematics of the neutral ISM and evaluate the optical
depth and and covering fraction of the neutral medium as a function of
line-of-sight velocity. Furthermore, we show how this, in combination with
precise determination of systemic velocity and good Ly$\alpha$ spectra, can be
used to distinguish a model in which separate clumps together fully cover the
background source, from the ""picket fence"" model named by Heckman et al.
(2011). We find that no one single effect dominates in governing Ly$\alpha$
radiative transfer and escape. Ly$\alpha$ escape in our sample coincides with a
maximum velocity-binned covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.9$ and bulk outflow
velocities of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$, although a number of galaxies show
these characteristics and yet little or no Ly$\alpha$ escape. We find that
Ly$\alpha$ peak velocities, where available, are not consistent with a strong
backscattered component, but rather with a simpler model of an intrinsic
emission line overlaid by a blueshifted absorption profile from the outflowing
wind. Finally, we find a strong anticorrelation between H$\alpha$ equivalent

problem. To accomplish this we first identify approaches to benchmarking
anomaly detection algorithms across the literature and produce a large corpus
of anomaly detection benchmarks that vary in their construction across several
dimensions we deem important to real-world applications: (a) point difficulty,
(b) relative frequency of anomalies, (c) clusteredness of anomalies, and (d)
relevance of features. We apply a representative set of anomaly detection
algorithms to this corpus, yielding a very large collection of experimental
results. We analyze these results to understand many phenomena observed in
previous work. First we observe the effects of experimental design on
experimental results. Second, results are evaluated with two metrics, ROC Area
Under the Curve and Average Precision. We employ statistical hypothesis testing
to demonstrate the value (or lack thereof) of our benchmarks. We then offer
several approaches to summarizing our experimental results, drawing several
conclusions about the impact of our methodology as well as the strengths and
weaknesses of some algorithms. Last, we compare results against a trivial
solution as an alternate means of normalizing the reported performance of
algorithms. The intended contributions of this article are many; in addition to
providing a large publicly-available corpus of anomaly detection benchmarks, we
provide an ontology for describing anomaly detection contexts, a methodology
for controlling various aspects of benchmark creation, guidelines for future
experimental design and a discussion of the many potential pitfalls of trying
to measure success in this field.

understanding complex physical, biological and technological systems. Recent
studies have made important advances in identifying sensor or driver nodes,
through which we can observe or control a complex system. Yet, the
observational uncertainty induced by measurement noise and the energy required
for control continue to be significant challenges in practical applications.
Here we show that the variability of control energy and observational
uncertainty for different directions of the state space depend strongly on the
number of driver nodes. In particular, we find that if all nodes are directly
driven, control is energetically feasible, as the maximum energy increases
sublinearly with the system size. If, however, we aim to control a system
through a single node, control in some directions is energetically prohibitive,
increasing exponentially with the system size. For the cases in between, the
maximum energy decays exponentially when the number of driver nodes increases.
We validate our findings in several model and real networks, arriving to a
series of fundamental laws to describe the control energy that together deepen
our understanding of complex systems.

working groups are reviewed. Multiple themes emerged for K-16 education from
the perspective of the history and philosophy of science. Key ones were that:
students need to understand that central to science is argumentation,
criticism, and analysis; students should be educated to appreciate science as
part of our culture; students should be educated to be science literate; what
is meant by the nature of science as discussed in much of the science education
literature must be broadened to accommodate a science literacy that includes
preparation for socioscientific issues; teaching for science literacy requires
the development of new assessment tools; and, it is difficult to change what
science teachers do in their classrooms. The principal conclusions drawn by the
editors are that: to prepare students to be citizens in a participatory
democracy, science education must be embedded in a liberal arts education;
science teachers alone cannot be expected to prepare students to be
scientifically literate; and, to educate students for scientific literacy will
require a new curriculum that is coordinated across the humanities,
history/social studies, and science classrooms.

equations that renders conventional explicit time integration unconditionally
unstable. Here, we explore a fully implicit PIC algorithm for the Vlasov-Darwin
model in multiple dimensions, which overcomes many difficulties of traditional
semi-implicit Darwin PIC algorithms. The finite-difference scheme for Darwin
field equations and particle equations of motion is space-time-centered,
employing particle sub-cycling and orbit-averaging. The algorithm conserves
total energy, local charge, canonical-momentum in the ignorable direction, and
preserves the Coulomb gauge exactly. An asymptotically well-posed fluid
preconditioner allows efficient use of large time steps and cell sizes, which
are determined by accuracy considerations, not stability, and can be orders of
magnitude larger than required in a standard explicit electromagnetic PIC
simulation. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency properties of the
algorithm with various numerical experiments in 2D-3V.

stability of suspended graphene, and for unraveling the long-standing
theoretical debate of the existence of low-dimensional crystalline state. The
rippling morphology of graphene, discovered also in other 2D materials, has a
profound impact on its electronic, mechanical and chemical properties.
Actually, before the discovery of graphene, rippling phenomena are widely
observed: for example, the roughing transition of crystalline interface, the
rippled phase in biomembrane, and crumpling of flexible sheet polymers modeled
by tethered surfaces. The fascinating truth that ripples exist in so many
different membrane-like materials implies possible existence of a universal
physical mechanism which was unclear. We consider the ripples in suspended
graphene as two parts, characterizing the first part by the spontaneous
curvature k which stabilizes the possible soft ZA modes, and the second part by
the thermal curvature kt which is caused directly by height fluctuation. By
choosing k as the order parameter of the system, we establish the Landau theory
modified by thermal fluctuation for wrinkling transition of large sized
graphene. We find that as temperature rises from 0K, a second order phase
transition occurs at a size dependent critical temperature Tc, which
corresponds to a change of equilibrium configuration from a flat state to a
rippling state. Interestingly, the order parameter is stablized as temperature
increases, and the phase transition is associated with a jump of equilibrium
bond length as well as a vanishing intrinsic bending rigidity. The results
obtained suggest that the interplay between the rippling morphology and the
elementary excitations is vital for understanding the behavior of 2D materials.
The concepts and theory developed here is of general significance at least for
tethered membranes.

Although there are a host of intriguing aspects to this question, it has
received much less attention in the research community in comparison to the
intra-community case. In this paper, we examine three aspects of
multi-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users post to, the
language that users employ in those communities, and the feedback that users
receive, using longitudinal posting behavior on Reddit as our main data source,
and DBLP for auxiliary experiments. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of

  One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the ""settling-down"" process

into a few niches. However, we find that the users in our data continually post
in new communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly evenly
among a more diverse set of smaller communities. Interestingly, it seems that
users that eventually leave the community are ""destined"" to do so from the very
beginning, in the sense of showing significantly different ""wandering"" patterns
very early on in their trajectories; this finding has potentially important
design implications for community maintainers. Our multi-community perspective
also allows us to investigate the ""situation vs. personality"" debate from

hybrid clustering technique to produce a series of clusterings of various sizes
(randomly selected). They key steps are to find a $K$-means clustering using
$K_\ell$ clusters where $K_\ell \gg K$ and then joins these small clusters by
using single linkage clustering. The second stage stabilizes the result of
stage one by reclustering via the `membership matrix' under Hamming distance to
generate a dendrogram. The third stage is to cut the dendrogram to get $K^*$
clusters where $K^* \geq K$ and then prune back to $K$ to give a final
clustering. A variant on our technique also gives a reasonable estimate for
$K_T$, the true number of clusters.

methods and we provide numerous examples involving real and simulated data to

improve both spectral and energy efficiencies by embedding cloud computing into

band unit (BBU) pool, while the intertier interference between RRHs and macro
base stations (MBSs) is still challenging in H-CRANs. In this paper, to
mitigate this inter-tier interference, a contract-based interference
coordination framework is proposed, where three scheduling schemes are
involved, and the downlink transmission interval is divided into three phases
accordingly. The core idea of the proposed framework is that the BBU pool
covering all RRHs is selected as the principal that would offer a contract to
the MBS, and the MBS as the agent decides whether to accept the contract or not
according to an individual rational constraint. An optimal contract design that
maximizes the rate-based utility is derived when perfect channel state
information (CSI) is acquired at both principal and agent. Furthermore,
contract optimization under the situation where only the partial CSI can be
obtained from practical channel estimation is addressed as well. Monte Carlo
simulations are provided to confirm the analysis, and simulation results show
that the proposed framework can significantly increase the transmission data
rates over baselines, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
contract-based solution.

mechanics is addressed in the framework of the theory of
periodically-driven/controlled quantum-thermodynamic machines. The basic model
studied here is that of a two-level system (TLS), whose energy is periodically
modulated while the system is coupled to thermal baths. When the modulation
interval is short compared to the bath memory time, the system-bath
correlations are affected, thereby causing cooling or heating of the TLS,
depending on the interval. In steady state, a periodically-modulated TLS
coupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine
(QHM) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator, depending on the
modulation rate. We find their efficiency and power-output bounds and the
conditions for attaining these bounds. An extension of this model to multilevel
systems shows that the QHM power output can be boosted by the multilevel
degeneracy.
  These results are used to scrutinize basic thermodynamic principles: (i)
Externally-driven/modulated QHMs may attain the Carnot efficiency bound, but
when the driving is done by a quantum device (""piston""), the efficiency
strongly depends on its initial quantum state. Such dependence has been unknown
thus far. (ii) The refrigeration rate effected by QHMs does not vanish as the
temperature approaches absolute zero for certain quantized baths, e.g.,
magnons, thous challenging Nernst's unattainability principle. (iii)
System-bath correlations allow more work extraction under periodic control than
that expected from the Szilard-Landauer principle, provided the period is in
the non-Markovian domain. Thus, dynamically-controlled QHMs may benefit from
hitherto unexploited thermodynamic resources.

technologies) is $>2$ orders of magnitude worse than theoretical predictions. A
detailed study of several calorimetric detectors suggests that a mismatch
between the sensor and signal bandwidths is the primary reason for suppressed
sensitivity. With this understanding, we propose a detector design in which a
thin-film Au pad is directly deposited onto a massive absorber that is then
thermally linked to a separately fabricated TES chip via an Au wirebond,
providing large electron-phonon coupling (i.e. high signal bandwidth), ease of
fabrication, and cosmogenic background suppression. Interestingly, this design
strategy is fully compatible with the use of hygroscopic crystals (NaI) as
absorbers. An 80-mm diameter Si light detector based upon these design
principles, with potential use in both dark matter and neutrinoless double beta
decay, has an estimated baseline energy resolution of 0.35 eV, 20$\times$
better than currently achievable. A 1.75 kg ZnMoO$_{4}$ large-mass calorimeter
would have a 3.5 eV baseline resolution, 1000$\times$ better than currently
achieved with NTDs with an estimated position dependence $\frac{\Delta E}{E}$
of 6$\times$10$^{-4}$. Such minimal position dependence is made possible by
forcing the sensor bandwidth to be much smaller than the signal bandwidth.
Further, intrinsic event timing resolution is estimated to be $\sim$170 $\mu$s
for 3 MeV recoils in the phonon detector, satisfying the event-rate
requirements of large $Q_{\beta \beta}$ next-generation neutrinoless double
beta decay experiments. Quiescent bias power for both of these designs is found
to be significantly larger than parasitic power loads achieved in the
SPICA/SAFARI infrared bolometers.

manifold M are cohomology classes which can be represented by a minimal
rational curve on a deformation of M. We determine the Teichmuller space of
hyperkahler structures on a hyperkahler manifold, identifying any of its
connected components with an open subset of the Grassmannian
$SO(b_2-3,3)/SO(3)\times SO(b_2-3)$ consisting of all Beauville-Bogomolov
positive 3-planes in $H^2(M, R)$ which are not orthogonal to any of the MBM
classes. This is used to determine the Teichmuller space of symplectic
structures of Kahler type on a hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy. We
show that any connected component of this space is naturally identified with
the space of cohomology classes $v\in H^2(M,\R)$ with $q(v,v)>0$, where $q$ is
the Bogomolov-Beauville-Fujiki form on $H^2(M,\R)$.

Yet the nature of the sliding friction between two aligned filaments

directly measuring the sliding forces between two bundled F-actin filaments, we
show that these frictional forces are unexpectedly large, scale logarithmically
with sliding velocity as in solid-like friction, and exhibit complex dependence
on the filaments' overlap length. We also show that a reduction of the
frictional force by orders of magnitude, associated with a transition from
solid-like friction to Stokes' drag, can be induced by coating F-actin with
polymeric brushes. Furthermore, we observe similar transitions in filamentous

the capsid protein adopt different conformations at precise locations within
the capsid. It has been shown that a 19 nucleotide stem loop (TR) from the MS2
genome acts as an allosteric effector, guiding conformational switching of the
coat protein during capsid assembly. Since the principal conformational changes
occur far from the TR binding site, it is important to understand the molecular
mechanism underlying this allosteric communication. To this end, we use
all-atom simulations with explicit water combined with a path sampling
technique to sample the MS2 coat protein conformational transition, in the
presence and absence of TR-binding. The calculations find that TR binding
strongly alters the transition free energy profile, leading to a switch in the
favored conformation. We discuss changes in molecular interactions responsible
for this shift. We then identify networks of amino acids with correlated
motions to reveal the mechanism by which effects of TR binding span the
protein. The analysis predicts amino acids whose substitution by mutagenesis
could alter populations of the conformational substates or their transition
rates.

that by first deriving a communication model which includes the chemical

ligand-receptor process in the receiver. This model, which takes the form of a
continuous-time Markov process, captures the noise in the receiver signal due
to the stochastic nature of chemical reactions and diffusion. We then adopt a
maximum a posterior framework and use Bayesian filtering to derive the optimal
demodulator. We use numerical examples to illustrate the properties of this

functions on G that are sparse with respect to the Fourier basis. We establish
combinatorial conditions on subsets S and T of Fourier basis elements under
which nonnegative functions with Fourier support S are sums of squares of
functions with Fourier support T. Our combinatorial condition involves
constructing a chordal cover of a graph related to G and S (the Cayley graph
Cay($\hat{G}$,S)) with maximal cliques related to T. Our result relies on two
main ingredients: the decomposition of sparse positive semidefinite matrices
with a chordal sparsity pattern, as well as a simple but key observation
exploiting the structure of the Fourier basis elements of G.
  We apply our general result to two examples. First, in the case where $G =
\mathbb{Z}_2^n$, by constructing a particular chordal cover of the half-cube
graph, we prove that any nonnegative quadratic form in n binary variables is a
sum of squares of functions of degree at most $\lceil n/2 \rceil$, establishing
a conjecture of Laurent. Second, we consider nonnegative functions of degree d
on $\mathbb{Z}_N$ (when d divides N). By constructing a particular chordal
cover of the d'th power of the N-cycle, we prove that any such function is a
sum of squares of functions with at most $3d\log(N/d)$ nonzero Fourier
coefficients. Dually this shows that a certain cyclic polytope in
$\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ with N vertices can be expressed as a projection of a section
of the cone of psd matrices of size $3d\log(N/d)$. Putting $N=d^2$ gives a
family of polytopes $P_d \subset \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ with LP extension complexity

$\text{xc}_{PSD}(P_d) = O(d\log(d))$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first explicit family of polytopes in increasing dimensions where
$\text{xc}_{PSD}(P_d) = o(\text{xc}_{LP}(P_d))$.

Lasserre semidefinite hierarchies to approximate the resulting integer program.
Interestingly, for our prediction algorithms, we only need to compute the

consumption in social networks. We consider two firms in a market competing to
maximize the consumption of their products. Firms have a limited budget which
can be either invested on the quality of the product or spent on initial
seeding in the network in order to better facilitate spread of the product.
After the decision of firms, agents choose their consumptions following a
myopic best response dynamics which results in a local, linear update for their
consumption decision. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium of the game
between firms and study the effect of the budgets as well as the network
structure on the optimal allocation. We show that at the equilibrium, firms
invest more budget on quality when their budgets are close to each other.
However, as the gap between budgets widens, competition in qualities becomes
less effective and firms spend more of their budget on seeding. We also show
that given equal budget of firms, if seeding budget is nonzero for a balanced
graph, it will also be nonzero for any other graph, and if seeding budget is
zero for a star graph it will be zero for any other graph as well. As a
practical extension, we then consider a case where products have some preset
qualities that can be only improved marginally. At some point in time, firms
learn about the network structure and decide to utilize a limited budget to
mount their market share by either improving the quality or new seeding some
agents to incline consumers towards their products. We show that the optimal
budget allocation in this case simplifies to a threshold strategy.
Interestingly, we derive similar results to that of the original problem, in
which preset qualities simulate the role that budgets had in the original
setup.

classification, recently much effort is spent on applying CNNs to video based
action recognition problems. One challenge is that video contains a varying
number of frames which is incompatible to the standard input format of CNNs.
Existing methods handle this issue either by directly sampling a fixed number
of frames or bypassing this issue by introducing a 3D convolutional layer which
conducts convolution in spatial-temporal domain.
  To solve this issue, here we propose a novel network structure which allows
an arbitrary number of frames as the network input. The key of our solution is
to introduce a module consisting of an encoding layer and a temporal pyramid
pooling layer. The encoding layer maps the activation from previous layers to a
feature vector suitable for pooling while the temporal pyramid pooling layer
converts multiple frame-level activations into a fixed-length video-level
representation. In addition, we adopt a feature concatenation layer which
combines appearance information and motion information. Compared with the frame
sampling strategy, our method avoids the risk of missing any important frames.
Compared with the 3D convolutional method which requires a huge video dataset
for network training, our model can be learned on a small target dataset
because we can leverage the off-the-shelf image-level CNN for model parameter
initialization. Experiments on two challenging datasets, Hollywood2 and HMDB51,
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art
methods while requiring much fewer training data.

rotating neutron star (NS) from a continuous gravitational wave (GW) signal

the NS, the GW takes a slightly longer time to travel to an observer than it
does in the absence of the NS. Such a time dilation effect holds also for
photons and is often referred to as the gravitational time delay (or the
Shapiro time delay). Correspondingly, the phase of the GW from the NS shifts
due to the Coulomb type gravitational potential of the NS, and the resulting
logarithmic phase shift depends on the mass, the spin frequency of the NS, and
the distance to the NS. We show that the NS mass can, in principle, be obtained
by making use of the phase shift difference between two modes of the continuous
GW such as once and twice spin frequency modes induced by a freely precessing
NS or a NS containing a pinned superfluid core. We estimate the measurement
accuracy of the NS mass using Monte Carlo simulations and find that the mass of

as one of inferring the distribution of collision events that move a system
toward thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary starting distribution. Using a
form based on maximum entropy for this transition distribution leads to a
statistical description of open quantum systems with strong parallels to the
conventional, maximum-entropy, equilibrium thermostatics. A precise form of the
second law of thermodynamics can be stated for this dynamics at every
time-point in a trajectory. Numerical results are presented for low-dimensional
systems interacting with cavity fields. The dynamics and stationary state are
compared to a reference model of a weakly coupled oscillator plus cavity
supersystem thermostatted by periodic partial measurements. Despite the absence
of an explicit cavity in the present model of open quantum dynamics, both the
relaxation rates and stationary state properties closely match the reference.
Additionally, the time-course of energy exchange and entropy increase is given
throughout an entire measurement process for a single spin system. The results
show the process to be capable of initially absorbing heat when starting from a
superposition state, but not from an isotropic distribution. Based on these
results, it is argued that logical inference in the presence of environmental

midshaft femur scan subjected to two deregulating circumstances: (i)
osteoporosis and (ii) mechanical disuse. Both simulated deregulations led to
endocortical bone loss, cortical wall thinning and expansion of the medullary

preserve intracortical bone matrix near the periosteum. Moreover, it leads to
non-uniform cortical wall thickness due to the asymmetry of macroscopic loads

preferred over the conventional $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ one by constructing dark
energy as the sum of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the additional
fluid that is designed to have an extremely short transient spike in energy
density during the radiation-matter equality era and the early scaling behavior
with radiation and matter densities. The density parameter of the additional
fluid is defined as a Gaussian function plus a constant in logarithmic
scale-factor space. Searching for the best-fit cosmological parameters in the
presence of such a dark energy spike gives a far smaller chi-square value by
about five times the number of additional parameters introduced and narrower
constraints on matter density and Hubble constant compared with the best-fit
$\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ model. The significant improvement in reducing chi-square
mainly comes from the better fitting of Planck temperature power spectrum
around the third ($\ell \approx 800$) and sixth ($\ell \approx 1800$) acoustic
peaks. The likelihood ratio test and the Akaike information criterion suggest
that the model of dark energy spike is strongly favored by the current
cosmological observations over the conventional $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ model.
However, based on the Bayesian information criterion which penalizes models
with more parameters, the strong evidence supporting the presence of dark

tackle these two problems separately. In fact the two tasks are often
interleaved with each other: noisy and high-dimensional features will bring
adverse effect on sample selection, while informative or representative samples
will be beneficial to feature selection. Specifically, we propose a framework
to jointly conduct active learning and feature selection based on the CUR

selected samples and features can best approximate the original dataset
respectively, such that the selected samples characterized by the features are
highly representative. In particular, our method runs in one-shot without the
procedure of iterative sample selection for progressive labeling. Thus, our
model is especially suitable when there are few labeled samples or even in the
absence of supervision, which is a particular challenge for existing methods.
As the joint learning problem is NP-hard, the proposed formulation involves a
convex but non-smooth optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an
iterative algorithm, and prove its global convergence. Experimental results on
publicly available datasets corroborate the efficacy of our method compared
with the state-of-the-art.

for solid tumors. While it is highly effective against tumors, there is also
collateral damage to healthy proximal tissues especially with high doses. The
use of radiosensitizers is an effective way to boost the killing efficacy of
radiotherapy against the tumor while drastically limiting the received dose and
reducing the possible damage to normal tissues. Here, we report the design and
application of a good radiosensitizer by using ultrasmall gold nanoclusters
with a naturally occurring peptide (e.g., glutathione or GSH) as the protecting
shell. The GSH coated gold nanoclusters can escape the RES absorption, leading
to a good tumor uptake (8.1% ID/g at 24 h post injection). As a result, the
as-designed Au nanoclusters led to a strong enhancement for radiotherapy, as
well as a negligible damage to normal tissues. After the treatment, the
ultrasmall gold nanoclusters can be efficiently cleared by the kidney, thereby
avoiding potential long term side effects caused by the accumulation of gold
atoms in the body. Our data suggest that the ultrasmall peptide protected Au
nanoclusters are a promising radiosensitizer for cancer radiotherapy.

scatter) is provided under the assumption that the dataset comprises
independent (essentially Gaussian) legitimate samples as well as arbitrary
deterministic samples, referred to as outliers. Building upon recent random
matrix advances in the area of robust statistics, we specifically show that the
so-called Maronna M-estimator of scatter asymptotically behaves similar to
well-known random matrices when the population and sample sizes grow together
to infinity. The introduction of outliers leads the robust estimator to behave
asymptotically as the weighted sum of the sample outer products, with a
constant weight for all legitimate samples and different weights for the
outliers. A fine analysis of this structure reveals importantly that the
propensity of the M-estimator to attenuate (or enhance) the impact of outliers
is mostly dictated by the alignment of the outliers with the inverse population
covariance matrix of the legitimate samples. Thus, robust M-estimators can
bring substantial benefits over more simplistic estimators such as the
per-sample normalized version of the sample covariance matrix, which is not
capable of differentiating the outlying samples. The analysis shows that,
within the class of Maronna's estimators of scatter, the Huber estimator is
most favorable for rejecting outliers. On the contrary, estimators more similar
to Tyler's scale invariant estimator (often preferred in the literature) run
the risk of inadvertently enhancing some outliers.

characteristic phase behavior and structure. Sometimes its long range is
proposed to single out the electrostatic potential over other interactions with
shorter ranges. Here the importance of the range for the phase behavior and the
structure of ionic fluids is investigated by means of grandcanonical Monte
Carlo simulations of the lattice restricted primitive model (LRPM). The
long-ranged electrostatic interaction is compared to various types of
short-ranged potentials obtained by sharp and/or smooth cut-off schemes.
Sharply cut off electrostatic potentials are found to lead to a strong
dependence of the phase behavior and the structure on the cut-off radius.
However, when combined with a suitable additional smooth cut-off, the
short-ranged LRPM is found to exhibit quantitatively the same phase behavior
and structure as the conventional long-ranged LRPM. Moreover, the
Stillinger-Lovett perfect screening property, which is well-known to be
generated by the long-ranged electrostatic potential, is also fulfilled by
short-ranged LRPMs with smooth cut-offs. By showing that the characteristic
phase behavior and structure of ionic fluids can also be found in systems with
short-ranged potentials, one can conclude that the decisive property of the
electrostatic potential in ionic fluids is not the long range but rather the
valency dependence.

show that self-absorption should also be considered depending on the mass loss
rate and the temperature reached by circumstellar gas.
  HI emission from circumstellar shells has been mostly reported from stars
with mass loss rates around 10$^{-7}$ solar masses per year. We discuss the
possible reasons for the non detection of many sources with larger mass loss
rates that are hallmarks of the end of the AGB phase. Although radiative
transfer effects may weaken the line emission, they cannot alone account for
this effect. Therefore, it seems likely that molecular hydrogen, rather than
atomic hydrogen, dominates the composition of matter expelled by stars at the
end of their evolution on the Asymptotic Giant Branch. However sensitive HI
observations can still yield important information on the kinematics and
physical properties of the circumstellar material at large distances from
central stars with heavy mass loss, despite the low abundance of atomic

polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), and variational transition state theory with
multidimensional tunnelling(VTST/MT), based on a refined full-dimensional
analytical potential energy surface, PES-2014, in the temperature range
200-2000 K. For the OH + CH4 reaction, at low temperatures, T = 200 K, where
the quantum tunnelling effect is more important, RPMD overestimates the
experimental rate constants due to problems associated with PES-2014 in the
deep tunnelling regime and to the known overestimation of this method in
asymmetric reactions, while VTST/MT presents a better agreement, differences
about 10%, due to compensation of several factors, inaccuracy of PES-2014 and
ignoring anharmonicity. In the opposite extreme, T = 1000 K, recrossing effects
play the main role, and the difference between both methods is now smaller, by
a factor of 1.5. Given that RPMD results are exact in the high-temperature
limit, the discrepancy is due to the approaches used in the VTST/MT method,
such as ignoring the anharmonicity of the lowest vibrational frequencies along
the reaction path which leads to an incorrect location of the dividing surface
between reactants and products. The analysis of several kinetic isotope
effects, OH + CD4, OD + CH4, and OH + 12CH4/13CH4, sheds light on these
problems and confirms the previous conclusions. In general, the agreement with
the available experimental data is reasonable, although discrepancies persist,
and they have been analysed as a function of the many factors affecting the
theoretical calculations: limitations of the kinetics methods and of the
potential energy surface, and uncertainties in the experimental measurements.

P_br,BLLAC > 10^23.3 W/Hz otherwise they would outnumber the density of
weak-lined and compact radio sources, while the observations indicate
P_br,BLLAC < 10^24.5 W/Hz. In the framework of the AGN unified model a low
luminosity break in the RLF of LRP AGN must correspond to a break in the RLF of
BL Lacs. The ratio between P_br,LRP and P_br,BLLAC is ~10^3, as expected for a
jet Doppler factor of ~10.

scattering, Andr\'e Martin and S. M. Roy recently obtained absolute bounds on
the D-wave below threshold for pion-pion scattering and thereby determined the
scale of the logarithm in the Froissart bound on total cross sections in terms
of pion mass only. Previously, Martin proved a rigorous upper bound on the
inelastic cross-section $\sigma_{inel}$ which is one-fourth of the
corresponding upper bound on $\sigma_{tot}$, and Wu, Martin,Roy and Singh
improved the bound by adding the constraint of a given $\sigma_{tot}$. Here we
use unitarity and analyticity to determine, without any high energy
approximation, upper bounds on energy averaged inelastic cross sections in
terms of low energy data in the crossed channel. These are Froissart-type
bounds without any unknown coefficient or unknown scale factors and can be
tested experimentally. Alternatively, their asymptotic forms,together with the
Martin-Roy absolute bounds on pion-pion D-waves below threshold, yield absolute
bounds on energy-averaged inelastic cross sections. E.g. for $\pi^0 \pi^0$
scattering, defining $\sigma_{inel}=\sigma_{tot} -\big (\sigma^{\pi^0 \pi^0
\rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0} + \sigma^{\pi^0 \pi^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^-} \big
)$,we show that for c.m. energy $\sqrt{s}\rightarrow \infty $,
$\bar{\sigma}_{inel }(s,\infty)\equiv s\int_{s} ^{\infty } ds'\sigma_{inel
}(s')/s'^2 \leq (\pi /4) (m_{\pi })^{-2} [\ln (s/s_1)+(1/2)\ln \ln (s/s_1)
+1]^2$ where $1/s_1= 34\pi \sqrt{2\pi }\>m_{\pi }^{-2} $ . This bound is
asymptotically one-fourth of the corresponding Martin-Roy bound on the total
cross section, and the scale factor $s_1$ is one-fourth of the scale factor in
the total cross section bound. The average over the interval (s,2s) of the
inelastic $\pi^0 \pi^0 $cross section has a bound of the same form with $1/s_1$
replaced by $1/s_2=2/s_1 $.

solutions to the flow of generalized Newtonian fluids through circular pipes
and plane slits. The new method is not based on the use of the Euler-Lagrange
variational principle and hence it is totally independent of our previous
approach which is based on this principle. Instead, the method applies a very
generic and general optimization approach which can be justified by the
Dirichlet principle although this is not the only possible theoretical
justification. The results that were obtained from the new method using nine
types of fluid are in total agreement, within certain restrictions, with the
results obtained from the traditional methods of fluid mechanics as well as the
results obtained from the previous variational approach. In addition to being a
useful method in its own for resolving the flow field in circular pipes and
plane slits, the new variational method lends more support to the old
variational method as well as for the use of variational principles in general
to resolve the flow of generalized Newtonian fluids and obtain all the
quantities of the flow field which include shear stress, local viscosity, rate
of strain, speed profile and volumetric flow rate. The theoretical basis of the
new variational method, which rests on the use of the Dirichlet principle, also
provides theoretical support to the former variational method.

determined for the ${L=\infty}$ semi-infinite case in the scaling regime for
all values of the temperature scaling field $t=(T-T_c)/T_c$ above and below the

semiclassical and boundary-operator expansions and a trace formula to derive
exact analytical results for a number of quantities such as two-point

amplitude difference associated with the thermal singularity of the surface
free energy, and potential coefficients. The asymptotic behaviors of the scaled

commissioning data from the Boolardy Engineering Test Array of the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Using the 711.5 - 1015.5 MHz band of
ASKAP we were able to conduct a blind search for the 21-cm line in a continuous
redshift range between $z = 0.4$ and 1.0, which has, until now, remained
largely unexplored. The absorption line is detected at $z = 0.44$ towards the
GHz-peaked spectrum radio source PKS B1740$-$517 and demonstrates ASKAP's
excellent capability for performing a future wide-field survey for HI
absorption at these redshifts. Optical spectroscopy and imaging using the
Gemini-South telescope indicates that the HI gas is intrinsic to the host
galaxy of the radio source. The narrow OIII emission lines show clear
double-peaked structure, indicating either large-scale outflow or rotation of
the ionized gas. Archival data from the \emph{XMM-Newton} satellite exhibit an
absorbed X-ray spectrum that is consistent with a high column density obscuring
medium around the active galactic nucleus. The HI absorption profile is
complex, with four distinct components ranging in width from 5 to 300 km
s$^{-1}$ and fractional depths from 0.2 to 20 per cent. In addition to systemic
HI gas, in a circumnuclear disc or ring structure aligned with the radio jet,
we find evidence for a possible broad outflow of neutral gas moving at a radial
velocity of $v \sim 300$ km s$^{-1}$. We infer that the expanding young radio
source ($t_{\rm age} \approx 2500$ yr) is cocooned within a dense medium and
may be driving circumnuclear neutral gas in an outflow of $\sim$ 1
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

configuration of communications networks within reconfigurable clusters of
charging points. The CDI GE can be used for capturing the driver feedback in
terms of Quality of Experience (QoE) in those situations where the charging
power is abruptly limited as a consequence of short term grid needs, like the
shedding action asked by the Transmission System Operator to the Distribution
System Operator aimed at clearing networks contingencies due to the loss of a
transmission line or large wind power fluctuations. The NetIC GE can be used
when a master Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) hosts the Load Area
Controller, responsible for managing simultaneous charging sessions within a
given Load Area (LA); the reconfiguration of distribution grid topology results
in shift of EVSEs among LAs, then reallocation of slave EVSEs is needed.
Involved actors, equipment, communications and processes are identified through
the standardized framework provided by the Smart Grid Architecture Model

narrow profile (FWHM 14 km/s) and high critical densities (>1e6cm-3 ) of the

excitation temperatures of Tex 10-20 K for all ions except for H3O+, which is
most consistent with Tex 100 K. Although uncertain, the higher excitation

heterogeneity is caused by genetic variability and environmental factors, and
is expected to be linked to disease development. The abundance of experimental
data now enables the identification of features of gene expression profiles
that are shared across tissues, and those that are tissue-specific. While most
current research is concerned with characterising differential expression by
comparing mean expression profiles across tissues, it is also believed that a
significant difference in a gene expression's variance across tissues may also
be associated to molecular mechanisms that are important for tissue development
and function. We propose a sparse multi-view matrix factorisation (sMVMF)
algorithm to jointly analyse gene expression measurements in multiple tissues,
where each tissue provides a different ""view"" of the underlying organism. The
proposed methodology can be interpreted as an extension of principal component
analysis in that it provides the means to decompose the total sample variance
in each tissue into the sum of two components: one capturing the variance that
is shared across tissues, and one isolating the tissue-specific variances.
sMVMF has been used to jointly model mRNA expression profiles in three tissues
- adipose, skin and LCL - which are available for a large and well-phenotyped
twins cohort, TwinsUK. Using sMVMF, we are able to prioritise genes based on
whether their variation patterns are specific to each tissue. Furthermore,
using DNA methylation profiles available, we provide supporting evidence that
adipose-specific gene expression patterns may be driven by epigenetic effects.

inhibit metal oxidation and corrosion, graphene can form a galvanic cell with

Boron nitride (BN) nanosheets which have a similar impermeability could be a
better choice as protective barrier, because they are more thermally and
chemically stable than graphene and, more importantly, do not cause galvanic
corrosion due to their electrical insulation. In this study, the performance of
commercially available BN nanosheets grown by chemical vapor deposition as a
protective coating on metal has been investigated. The heating of the copper
foil covered with the BN nanosheet at 250 {\deg}C in air over 100 h results in
dramatically less oxidation than the bare copper foil heated for 2 h under the
same conditions. The electrochemical analyses reveal that the BN nanosheet
coating can increase open circuit potential and possibly reduce oxidation of
the underlying copper foil in sodium chloride solution. These results indicate
that BN nanosheets are a good candidate for oxidation and corrosion protection,
although conductive atomic force microscopy analyses show that the
effectiveness of the protection relies on the quality of BN nanosheets.

as a personal repository for yet unpublished materials, (2) as a platform for
newly published research materials, and (3) as an archive for PLOS. Depending
on the function, we found different bibliometric characteristics. Items
archived from PLOS tend to be coming from the natural sciences and are often
unviewed and non-downloaded. Self-archived items, however, come from a variety
of disciplines and exhibit some patterns of higher usage. In the altmetrics
analysis, we found that Twitter was the social media service where research

most popular across social media services. PlumX detects considerably more
items in social media and also finds higher altmetric scores than ImpactStory.

challenge in natural and social sciences. Assuming the effect is generated by
the cause trough a linear system, we propose a new approach based on the
hypothesis that nature chooses the ""cause"" and the ""mechanism that generates
the effect from the cause"" independent of each other. We therefore postulate
that the power spectrum of the time series being the cause is uncorrelated with
the square of the transfer function of the linear filter generating the effect.
While most causal discovery methods for time series mainly rely on the noise,
our method relies on asymmetries of the power spectral density properties that
can be exploited even in the context of deterministic systems. We describe
mathematical assumptions in a deterministic model under which the causal
direction is identifiable with this approach. We also discuss the method's
performance under the additive noise model and its relationship to Granger
causality. Experiments show encouraging results on synthetic as well as
real-world data. Overall, this suggests that the postulate of Independence of
Cause and Mechanism is a promising principle for causal inference on empirical
time series.

non-monotonic behavior when the strain magnitude is varied. In particular, with

outburst, at only 2.4 arcsec angular distance from the supermassive black hole
at the Centre of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*. SGR 1745-2900 has a surface
dipolar magnetic field of ~ 2x10^{14} G, and it is the neutron star closest to
a black hole ever observed. The new source was detected both in the radio and
X-ray bands, with a peak X-ray luminosity L_X ~ 5x10^{35} erg s^{-1}. Here we
report on the long-term Chandra (25 observations) and XMM-Newton (8
observations) X-ray monitoring campaign of SGR 1745-2900, from the onset of the
outburst in April 2013 until September 2014. This unprecedented dataset allows
us to refine the timing properties of the source, as well as to study the
outburst spectral evolution as a function of time and rotational phase. Our
timing analysis confirms the increase in the spin period derivative by a factor
of ~2 around June 2013, and reveals that a further increase occurred between
2013 Oct 30 and 2014 Feb 21. We find that the period derivative changed from
6.6x10^{-12} s s^{-1} to 3.3x10^{-11} s s^{-1} in 1.5 yr. On the other hand,
this magnetar shows a slow flux decay compared to other magnetars and a rather
inefficient surface cooling. In particular, starquake-induced crustal cooling
models alone have difficulty in explaining the high luminosity of the source
for the first ~200 days of its outburst, and additional heating of the star
surface from currents flowing in a twisted magnetic bundle is probably playing
an important role in the outburst evolution.

light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The enhancement by a factor of 1.2 compared to a

possessing a low refractive index (1.52). The low refractive index reduces the
in-plane wave vector of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excited at the
interface between the bottom opaque metallic electrode (anode) and the HTL. The
shift of the SPP dispersion relation decreases the power dissipated into lost
evanescent excitations and thus increases the outcoupling efficiency, although
the SPP remains constant in intensity. The proposed method is suitable for
emitter materials owning isotropic orientation of the transition dipole moments
as well as anisotropic, preferentially horizontal orientation, resulting in
comparable enhancement factors. Furthermore, for sufficiently low refractive
indices of the HTL material, the SPP can be modeled as a propagating plane wave
within other organic materials in the optical microcavity. Thus, by applying
further extraction methods, such as micro lenses or Bragg gratings, it would
become feasible to obtain even higher enhancements of the light extraction.

non-perturbative in the elastic tunneling amplitudes, employing an instanton
calculation in one or two of the available elastic tunneling channels. Our
analysis accounts for non-trivial Klein factors, which represent anyonic or

the fact that higher order tunneling processes take place. In particular we
find a stable fixed point, where an incoming current is split ${1 \over 2}$ -
$1\over 2$ between a forward and a backward scattered beams. This intermediate

functions to include products, in analogy with the practice in real algebraic
geometry, and hence the term preordering in the title. This is done over
abstract sets and no additional property, such as analyticity, is assumed.
Realization theorems give several equivalent ways of characterizing the unit
ball (referred to as the Schur-Agler class) of the function algebras. These
typically include, in Agler's terminology, a model (here called an Agler
decomposition), a transfer function representation, and an analogue of the
von~Neumann inequality. The new ingredient is a certain set of matrix valued
functions termed ""auxiliary test functions"" used in constructing transfer
functions. In important ses, the realization theorems can be strengthened so as
to allow applications to Pick type interpolation problems, among other things.
Principle examples have as the domain the polydisk $\mathbb D^d$. The algebras
then include $H^\infty(\mathbb D^d,\mathcal{L(H)})$ (where the unit ball is
traditionally called the Schur class) and $A(\mathbb D^d,\mathcal{L(H)})$, the
multivariable analogue of the disk algebra. As an application, it is shown that
over the polydisk $\mathbb D^d$, (weakly continuous) representations which are
$2^{d-2}$ contractive are completely contractive (hence having a commuting
unitary dilation), offering fresh insight into such examples as Parrott's of
contractive representations of $A(\mathbb D^3)$ which are not completely
contractive.

  In general, disks are less commonly detected around binaries than single

multiplicity. However, this sample reveals the period distribution of
disk-bearing binaries is consistent with that of non-disk binaries and with
comparison field samples. We find that the properties of disks in binary

Although the frequency of disk-bearing FGK binaries may be lower than in single

of nodes. Usually, such a modular structure is uncovered by the optimization of

popular quality functions. The Louvain algorithm was originally developed for
optimizing modularity, but has been applied to a variety of methods. As such,
speeding up the Louvain algorithm, enables the analysis of larger graphs in a
shorter time for various methods. We here suggest to consider moving nodes to a
random neighbor community, instead of the best neighbor community. Although
incredibly simple, it reduces the theoretical runtime complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(m)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log \langle k \rangle)$ in networks with a
clear community structure. In benchmark networks, it speeds up the algorithm
roughly 2-3 times, while in some real networks it even reaches 10 times faster
runtimes. This improvement is due to two factors: (1) a random neighbor is
likely to be in a ""good"" community; and (2) random neighbors are likely to be
hubs, helping the convergence. Finally, the performance gain only slightly
diminishes the quality, especially for modularity, thus providing a good
quality-performance ratio. However, these gains are less pronounced, or even
disappear, for some other measures such as significance or surprise.

fact that we derive and use the full radial profile of sigma rather than a

show that the profile of the Q stability parameter traced by CO emission is
remarkably flat and well above unity, while the characteristic instability
wavelength exhibits clear signatures of the nuclear starburst and inner bar

often reduces to the mixing time, i.e., the time required to reach the steady
state of the Markov chain, which scales as $\delta^{-1}$, the inverse of the
spectral gap. It has long been conjectured that quantum computers offer nearly
generic quadratic improvements for mixing problems. However, except in special
cases, quantum algorithms achieve a run-time of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}}

Markov chains when these form a slowly evolving sequence. This setting is akin
to the simulated annealing setting and is commonly encountered in physics,
material sciences and machine learning. We provide a quantum memory-efficient
algorithm with a run-time of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} \sqrt[4]{N})$,
neglecting logarithmic terms, which is an important improvement for large state

spectroscopic masses of massive stars. Specifically, we investigate the
contribution of line and continuum transitions to the photospheric radiative
pressure. We further explore the effect of model parameters, e.g., abundances,
on the deduced spectroscopic mass. Lastly, we compare our results with the
plane-parallel TLUSTY code, commonly used for the analysis of massive stars
with photospheric spectra. METHODS: We calculate a small set of O-star models
with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code using different approaches for the
quasi-hydrostatic part. These models allow us to quantify the effect of
accounting for the radiative pressure consistently. We further use PoWR models
to show how the Doppler widths of line profiles and abundances of elements such
as iron affect the radiative pressure, and, as a consequence, the derived
spectroscopic masses. RESULTS: Our study implies that errors on the order of a
factor of two in the inferred spectroscopic mass are to be expected when
neglecting the contribution of line and continuum transitions to the radiative
acceleration in the photosphere. Usage of implausible microturbulent
velocities, or the neglect of important opacity sources such as Fe, may result
in errors of approximately 50% in the spectroscopic mass. A comparison with
TLUSTY model atmospheres reveals a very good agreement with PoWR at the limit
of low mass-loss rates.

galaxies brighter than MV=-19.5 (5,504 objects), stacking up the 76 clusters of
the WINGS survey altogether. Using this global cluster sample, we find that the
T-Sigma relation holds only in the inner cluster regions (R<1/3xR200), while
the T-R relation keeps almost unchanged over the whole range of local density.
A couple of tests and two sets of numerical simulations support the robustness
of these results against the effects of the limited cluster area coverage of
the WINGS imaging. The above mentioned results hold for all cluster masses
(X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion) and all galaxy stellar masses (M).
The strength of the T-Sigma relation (where present) increases with increasing
M, while this effect is not found for the T-R relation. Noticeably, the
absence/presence of subclustering determines the presence/absence of the
T-Sigma relation outside the inner cluster regions, leading us to the general
conclusion that the link between morphology and local density is preserved just
in dynamically evolved regions. We hypothesize that some mechanism of
morphological broadening/redistribution operates in the intermediate/outer
regions of substructured (non relaxed) clusters, producing a strong weakening
of the T-Sigma relation.

that helicity affects the inertial range scaling of the velocity and of the
passive scalar when rotation is present, with a spectral law consistent with
$\sim k_{\perp}^{-1.4}$ for the passive scalar variance spectrum. This scaling
law is consistent with the phenomenological argument presented in
\cite{imazio2011} for rotating non-helical flows, wich states that if energy
follows a $E(k)\sim k^{-n}$ law, then the passive scalar variance follows a law
$V(k) \sim k^{-n_{\theta}}$ with $n_{\theta}=(5-n)/2$. With the second order
scaling exponent obtained from this law, and using the Kraichnan model, we
obtain anomalous scaling exponents for the passive scalar that are in good
agreement with the numerical results. Intermittency of the passive scalar is
found to be stronger than in the non-helical rotating case, a result that is
also confirmed by stronger non-Gaussian tails in the probability density
functions of field increments. Finally, Fick's law is used to compute the
effective diffusion coefficients in the directions parallel and perpendicular
to the rotation axis. Calculations indicate that horizontal diffusion decreases
in the presence of helicity in rotating flows, while vertical diffusion
increases. We use a mean field argument to explain this behavior in terms of
the amplitude of velocity field fluctuations.

Thanks to the vertex correction (VC) for the susceptibility, which is dropped

$Q \approx(2\pi/3,2\pi/3)$ emerge in the quasi one-dimensional Fermi surfaces

similar results are obtained by applying the diagrammatic calculation called

making frequent announcements on silicon photonics and disaggregated memory
systems.
  In this paper we study the trade-off between cost and performance of building
a disaggregated memory system where DRAM modules in the datacenter are pooled,
for example in memory-only chassis and racks. The compute pool and the memory
pool are interconnected by an optical interconnect to overcome the distance and
bandwidth issues of electrical fabrics. We construct a simple cost model that
includes the cost of latency, cost of bandwidth and the savings expected from a
disaggregated memory system. We then identify the level at which a
disaggregated memory system becomes cost competitive with a traditional direct
attached memory system.
  Our analysis shows that a rack-scale disaggregated memory system will have a
non-trivial performance penalty, and at the datacenter scale the penalty is
impractically high, and the optical interconnect costs are at least a factor of
10 more expensive than where they should be when compared to the traditional
direct attached memory systems.

  Cs2SnI6, a variant of perovskite CsSnI3, is expected for a photovoltaic
material. Based on a simple ionic model, it is expected that Cs2SnI6 is
composed of Cs+, I-, and Sn4+ ions and that the band gap is primarily made of
occupied I- 5p6 valence band maximum (VBM) and unoccupied Sn4+ 5s conduction
band minimum (CBM) similar to SnO2. In this work, we performed density
functional theory (DFT) calculations and revealed that the real oxidation state
of the Sn ion in Cs2SnI6 is +2 similar to CsSnI3. The +2 oxidation state of Sn
originates from 2 ligand holes in the [SnI6]2- octahedron unit, where the
ligand [I6] cluster has the apparent [I66-L+2]4- oxidation state, because the
band gap is formed mainly by occupied I 5p VBM and unoccupied I 5p CBM. The +2
oxidation state of Sn and the band gap are originated from the intracluster

hole metric. The accretion of any general kind of fluid flow around the black
hole have been investigated. The accretion of fluid flow around the modified
Hayward black hole have been analyzed and we then calculated the critical
point, fluid 4 velocity and velocity of sound during accretion process. Also
the nature of the dynamical mass of black hole during accretion of fluid flow
and taking into consideration of Hawking radiation from black hole i.e.,
evaporation of black hole have been analyzed.

  TV-type Reconstruction",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a novel variational approach for image compression
motivated by recent PDE-based approaches combining edge detection and Laplacian
inpainting. The essential feature is to encode the image via a sparse vector
field, ideally concentrating on a set of measure zero. An equivalent
reformulation of the compression approach leads to a variational model
resembling the ROF-model for image denoising, hence we further study the
properties of the effective regularization functional introduced by the novel
approach and discuss similarities to TV and TGV functionals. Moreover we
computationally investigate the behaviour of the model with sparse vector
fields for compression in particular for high resolution images and give an
outlook towards denoising.

we define and discuss the generalizations of linear partial differential

such equations: first, the generalized Schr\""odinger equation which is a
natural candidate for the mathematical equation of quantum field theory, and
second, the quantum Plato problem which is a natural candidate for a simplest
mathematical equation of string theory and, more generally, theory of
$D$-branes. We propose a way to give a mathematical sense to these equations.

directed or undirected graphs. The theory follows the same paradigm as
classical sampling theory. We show that perfect recovery is possible for graph
signals bandlimited under the graph Fourier transform. The sampled signal
coefficients form a new graph signal, whose corresponding graph structure
preserves the first-order difference of the original graph signal. For general
graphs, an optimal sampling operator based on experimentally designed sampling
is proposed to guarantee perfect recovery and robustness to noise; for graphs
whose graph Fourier transforms are frames with maximal robustness to erasures
as well as for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, random sampling leads to perfect
recovery with high probability. We further establish the connection to the
sampling theory of finite discrete-time signal processing and previous work on
signal recovery on graphs. To handle full-band graph signals, we propose a
graph filter bank based on sampling theory on graphs. Finally, we apply the
proposed sampling theory to semi-supervised classification on online blogs and
digit images, where we achieve similar or better performance with fewer labeled
samples compared to previous work.

of gravity, which was initially proposed to obtain correct dynamics of galaxies
and galaxy clusters without dark matter. The thermodynamics of non-rotating and
rotating black hole solutions resembles similar solutions in Einstein-Maxwell
theory with the electric charge being replaced by a new mass dependent
gravitational charge $Q = \sqrt{\alpha G_N}M$. This new mass dependent charge
modifies the effective Newtonian constant from $G_N$ to $G = G_N(1+\alpha)$,
and this in turn critically affects the thermodynamics of the black holes. We
also investigate the thermodynamics of regular solutions, and explore the
limiting case when no horizons forms. So, it is possible that the modified
gravity can lead to the absence of black hole horizons in our universe.
Finally, we analyze corrections to the thermodynamics of a non-rotating black
hole and obtain the usual logarithmic correction term.
