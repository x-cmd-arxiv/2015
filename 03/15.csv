total cluster light which is in the intracluster light (ICL) and the numbers of
mergers that occur in the BCG over the redshift range of the sample,
0.18<z<0.90. We find that BCGs grow in stellar mass by a factor of 1.4 on
average from accretion of their companions, and this growth is reduced to a
factor of 1.2 assuming 50% of the accreted stellar mass becomes ICL, in line
with the predictions of simulations. We find that the ICL shows significant
growth over this same redshift range, growing by a factor of of 4--5 in its
contribution to the total cluster light. This result is in line with our
previous findings for ICL at higher redshifts, however our measured growth is
somewhat steeper than is predicted by simulations of ICL assembly. We find high
mass companions and hence major merging (mergers with objects of masses
$\geq$1/2 of the BCG) to be very rare for our sample. We conclude that minor
mergers (mergers with objects with masses $<$ 1/2 of the BCG) are the dominant
process for stellar mass assembly at low redshifts, with the majority of the
stellar mass from interactions ending up contributing to the ICL rather than
building up the BCG. From a rough estimate of the stellar mass growth of the
ICL we also conclude that the majority of the ICL stars must come from galaxies
which fall from outside of the core of the cluster, as is predicted by
simulations. It appears that the growth of the ICL is the major evolution event
in galaxy cluster cores during the second half of the lifetime of the Universe.

the matter and lensing power spectra measured from halo mock catalogues
extracted from the N-body simulations. Since N-body simulations are
computationally expensive, it is common to use faster methods that approximate
the dark matter field as a set of halos. In this approximation, we replace mass
concentrations in N-body simulations by a spherically symmetric
Navarro-Frenk-White halo density profile. We also consider the full mass field
as the sum of two distinct fields: dark matter halos ($M>9\times
10^{12}~M_{\odot}$/h) and particles not included into halos. Mock halos
reproduce well the matter power spectrum, but underestimate the lensing power
spectrum on large and small scales. For sources at $z_{\rm s}=1$ the lensing
power spectrum is underestimated by up to 40% at $\ell\approx 10^4$ with
respect to the simulated halos. The large scale effect can be alleviated by
combining the mock catalogue with the dark matter distribution outside the
halos. In addition, to evaluate the contribution of substructures we have
smeared out the intra-halo substructures in a N-body simulation while keeping
the halo density profiles unchanged. For the matter power spectrum the effect
of this smoothing is only of the order of 5%, but for lensing substructures are
much more important: for $\ell\approx 10^4$ the internal structures contribute
30% of the total spectrum. These findings have important implications in the
way mock catalogues have to be created, suggesting that some approximate
methods currently used for galaxy surveys will be inadequate for future weak
lensing surveys.

fluctuations. They dictate how physical systems of diverse nature, ranging from
fundamental particles to crystalline materials, respond topologically to
external perturbations, insensitive to local details. The anomaly paradigm was
triggered by the discovery of the chiral anomaly that contributes to the decay
of pions into photons and influences the motion of superfluid vortices in
$^3$He-A. In the solid state, it also fundamentally affects the properties of
topological Weyl and Dirac semimetals, recently realized experimentally in
TaAs, Na$_3$Bi, Cd$_3$As$_2$, and ZrTe$_{5}$. In this work we propose that the
most identifying consequence of the chiral anomaly, the charge density
imbalance between fermions of different chirality induced by non-orthogonal
electric and magnetic fields, can be directly observed in these materials with
the existing technology of photoemission spectroscopy. With angle resolution,
the chiral anomaly is identified by a characteristic note-shaped pattern of the
emission spectra, originating from the imbalanced occupation of the bulk states
and a previously unreported momentum dependent energy shift of the surface
state Fermi arcs. We further demonstrate that the chiral anomaly likewise
leaves an imprint in angle averaged emission spectra, facilitating its
experimental detection. Thereby, our work provides essential theoretical input
to foster the direct visualization of the chiral anomaly in condensed matter.

'Move Tables', which are like Transposition Tables, but for moves not
positions. They use an efficient memory structure and has put the design into
the context of long and short-term memories. The long-term memory updates a
play path with weight reinforcement, while the short-term memory can be
immediately added or removed. With this, 'long branches' can play a short path,
before returning to a full search at the resulting leaf nodes. Re-using an
earlier search path allows the tree to be forward-pruned, which is known to be
dangerous, because it removes part of the search process. Additional checks are
therefore made and moves can even be re-added when the search result is
unsatisfactory. Automatic feature analysis is now central to the algorithm,
where key squares and related squares can be generated automatically and used
to guide the search process. Using this analysis, if a search result is
inferior, it can re-insert un-played moves that cover these key squares only.
On the tactical side, a type of move that the forward-pruning will fail on is
recognised and a pattern-based solution to that problem is suggested. This has
completed the theory of an earlier paper and resulted in a more human-like
approach to searching for a chess move. Tests demonstrate that the obvious
blunders associated with forward pruning are no longer present and that it can
compete at the top level with regard to playing strength.

freely in the Euclidean plane operating in Look-Compute-Move cycles. Let p(t)
denote the location of entity p at time t; entity p can see entity q at time t
if at that time no other entity lies in the line segment p(t)q(t). We consider
the basic problem called Mutual Visibility: starting from arbitrary distinct
locations, within finite time the entities must reach, without collisions, a
configuration where they all see each other. This problem must be solved by
each entity autonomously executing the same algorithm. We study this problem in
the ""luminous robots"" model; in this generalization of the standard model of
oblivious robots, each entity, called ""robot"", has an externally visible
persistent light which can assume colors from a fixed set. The case where the
number of colors is c=1 corresponds to the classical model without lights.
  In this paper we investigate under what conditions luminous robots can solve
Mutual Visibility without collisions and at what cost (i.e., with how many
colors). We establish a spectrum of results, depending on the power of the
adversary, on the number c of colors, and on the a-priori knowledge the robots
have about the system. Among such results, we prove that Mutual Visibility can
always be solved without collisions in SSynch with c=2 colors and in ASynch
with c=3 colors. If an adversary can interrupt and stop a robot moving to its
computed destination, Mutual Visibility is still always solvable without
collisions in SSynch with c=3 colors, and, if the robots agree on the direction
of one axis, also in ASynch. All the results are obtained constructively by
means of novel protocols.
  As a byproduct of our solutions, we provide the first obstructed-visibility
solutions to two classical problems for oblivious robots: Collision-less
Convergence to a point and Circle Formation.

statistical distribution formulas if there is a universal limitation for the
size of energetic quantum leaps (magnitude of quantum leaps smaller than Planck
energy). By means of a restriction of the a priori equiprobability postulate
one can reach a thermodynamic foundation of these corrected distribution
formulas. The number of microstates is determined by means of a suitable
counting method and combined with thermodynamics via the Boltzmann principle.
The result is that, for particle energies that come close to the Planck energy,
the thermodynamic difference between fermion and boson distribution vanishes.
Both distributions then approximate a Boltzmann distribution. The wave and
particle character of the quantum particles, too, can be influenced by choosing
the size of the temperature and particle energy parameters relative to the
Planck energy, as you can see from the associated fluctuation formulas. In the
case of non-relativistic degeneration, the critical parameters Fermi momentum
(fermions) and Einstein temperature (bosons) vanish as soon as the rest energy
of the quantum particles reaches the Planck energy. For the Bose-Einstein
condensation there exists, in the condensation range, a finite upper limit for
the number of particles in the ground state, which is determined by the ratio
of Planck mass to the rest mass of the quantum particles. In the relativistic

significantly increased non-thermal spin polarization in nuclear magnetic

understanding of the precise mechanism behind DNP is so far lacking. We address
this issue by theoretically investigating solid effect DNP in a system where a
single electron is coupled to an ensemble of interacting nuclei and which can
be microscopically modelled by a quantum master equation. By deriving effective
equations of motion that govern the polarization dynamics we show analytically
that DNP can be understood as kinetically constrained spin diffusion. On the
one hand this approach provides analytical insights into the mechanism and
timescales underlying DNP. On the other hand it permits the numerical study of
large ensembles which are typically intractable from the perspective of a
quantum master equation. This paves the way for a detailed exploration of DNP
dynamics which might form the basis for future NMR applications.

extension of Crawford and Sobel's cheap talk formulation to multi-dimensional
sources and to noisy channel setups. We consider both (simultaneous) Nash

scalar sources, in the presence of misalignment, the quantized nature of all
equilibrium policies holds for Nash equilibria in the sense that all Nash
equilibria are equivalent to those achieved by quantized encoder policies. On
the other hand, all Stackelberg equilibria policies are fully informative. For
multi-dimensional setups, unlike the scalar case, Nash equilibrium policies may
be of non-quantized nature, and even linear. In the noisy setup, a Gaussian
source is to be transmitted over an additive Gaussian channel. The goals of the
encoder and the decoder are misaligned by a bias term and encoder's cost also
includes a penalty term on signal power. Conditions for the existence of affine
Nash equilibria as well as general informative equilibria are presented. For
the noisy setup, the only Stackelberg equilibrium is the linear equilibrium

the same methodology as in the previous paper in this series, deriving
atmospheric parameters by chi2 minimization, but this time we obtained the

Distances were calculated from absolute magnitudes obtained by a statistical
comparison of our stellar parameters with stellar-evolution models. The
observations reveal a decrease in the abundances of iron, calcium, and
magnesium at large distances from the Galactic center. The median abundances
for the halo stars analyzed are fairly constant up to a Galactocentric distance
r ~ 20 kpc, rapidly decrease between r ~ 20 and r ~ 40 kpc, and flatten out to
significantly lower values at larger distances, consistent with previous
studies. In addition, we examine the [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] as a function of Fe/H
and Galactocentric distance. Our results show that the most distant parts of
the halo show a steeper variation of the [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] with iron. We
found that at the range -1.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.4 [Ca/Fe] decreases with distance,
in agreement with earlier results based on local stars. However, the opposite
trend is apparent for [Mg/Fe]. Our conclusion that the outer regions of the
halo are more metal-poor than the inner regions, based on in situ observations
of distant stars, agrees with recent results based on inferences from the
kinematics of more local stars, and with predictions of recent galaxy formation
simulations for galaxies similar to the Milky Way.

well-characterized at optical and infra-red wavelengths. All stars show column
densities which are substantially smaller than expected from optical extinction
indicating that the sources are located on the near side of the cluster with
respect to the observer as well as that these stars are embedded in more dusty
environments. Stellar X-ray luminosities are well above $10^{31}$ erg/s, in
some cases exceeding $10^{32}$ erg/s for a substantial amount of time. The
stars during these observations show no flares but are persistently bright. The
spectra can be well fit with two temperature plasma components of 10 MK and 40
MK, of which the latter dominates the flux by a ratio 6:1 on average. The total
EMs range between 3 - 8$\times10^{54}$ cm$^{-3}$ and are comparable to active
coronal sources. Limits on the forbidden to inter-combination line ratios in

compare well with active coronal sources underlying the coronal nature of these

Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astron. vol. 116, 109, 2013) to the study of the rotation of
stars hosting massive close-in planets. The stars have nearly the same tidal
relaxation factors as gaseous planets and the evolution of their rotation is
similar to that of close-in hot Jupiters: they tidally evolve towards a
stationary solution. However, stellar rotation may also be affected by stellar
wind braking. Thus, while the rotation of a quiet host star evolves towards a
stationary attractor with a frequency ($1+6e^2$) times the orbital mean-motion
of the companion, the continuous loss of angular momentum in an active star
displaces the stationary solution towards slower values: Active host stars with
big close-in companions tend to have rotational periods larger than the orbital
periods of their companions. The study of some hypothetical examples shows that
because of tidal evolution, the rules of gyrochronology cannot be used to
estimate the age of one system with a large close-in companion, no matter if
the star is quiet or active, if the current semi-major axis of the companion is
smaller than 0.03--0.04 AU. Details on the evolution of the systems: CoRoT

Irregular galaxies are converted to stability parameters and scale heights for
a test of the importance of two-dimensional (2D) instabilities in promoting
star formation. A detailed model of this instability involving gaseous and
stellar fluids with self-consistent thicknesses and energy dissipation on a
perturbation crossing time give the unstable growth rates. We find that all
locations are effectively stable to 2D perturbations, mostly because the disks
are thick. We then consider the average volume densities in the midplanes,
evaluated from the observed HI surface densities and calculated scale heights.
The radial profiles of the star formation rates are equal to about 1% of the HI
surface densities divided by the free fall times at the average midplane
densities. This 1% resembles the efficiency per unit free fall time commonly
found in other cases. There is a further variation of this efficiency with
radius in all of our galaxies, following the exponential disk with a scale
length equal to about twice the stellar mass scale length. This additional
variation is modeled by the molecular fraction in a diffuse medium using
radiative transfer solutions for galaxies with the observed dimensions and
properties of our sample. We conclude that star formation is activated by a
combination of three-dimensional gaseous gravitational processes and molecule
formation. Implications for outer disk structure and formation are discussed.

$Y_W$ should be a classifying space for the pure braid group, and thus a
natural quotient ${Y_W}/{W}$ should be a classifying space for the braid group.
Salvetti provided a cell complex realization of the quotient, which we refer to

second homotopy group of the Salvetti complex is trivial. In this paper we

shown that EE maximization problem of the maximum relay is concave for time

consisting of two cavities. We show that depending on the nature of their
coupling, not only can the ""supermodes"" formed at the overlapping resonances of
the coupled cavities have the lowest thresholds and lase first as previously
suggested, leading to a manifestation of the typical Vernier effect now in an
active system; these supermodes can also have increased thresholds and are
hence suppressed, which can be viewed as an inverse Vernier effect. We
attribute this effect to detuning-dependent Q-spoiling, and it can lead to an
increased free spectrum range and possibly single-mode lasing, which may
explain the experimental findings of several previous work. We illustrate this
effect using two coupled micro-ring cavities and a micro-ring cavity coupled to
a slab cavity, and we discuss its relation to the existence of exceptional
points in coupled lasers.

sense that they host paired monopoles and antimonopoles of Berry curvature in
momentum space, leading to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly has long been
believed to give a positive magnetoconductivity or negative magnetoresistivity
in strong and parallel fields. However, several recent experiments on both Weyl
and Dirac topological semimetals show a negative magnetoconductivity in high
fields. Here, we study the magnetoconductivity of Weyl and Dirac semimetals in
the presence of short-range scattering potentials. In a strong magnetic field
applied along the direction that connects two Weyl nodes, we find that the
conductivity along the field direction is determined by the Fermi velocity,
instead of by the Landau degeneracy. We identify three scenarios in which the
high-field magnetoconductivity is negative. Our findings show that the
high-field positive magnetoconductivity may not be a compelling signature of
the chiral anomaly and will be helpful for interpreting the inconsistency in
the recent experiments and earlier theories.

presence of serial correlation of residuals from a least squares regression
analysis. However, the Durbin-Watson statistic is only suitable for ordered
time or spatial series. If the variables comprise cross-sectional data coming
from spatial random sampling, the Durbin-Watson will be ineffectual because the
value of Durbin-Watson's statistic depends on the sequences of data point
arrangement. Based on the ideas from spatial autocorrelation, this paper
presents two new statistics for testing serial correlation of residuals from
least squares regression based on spatial samples. By analogy with the new form
of Moran's index, an autocorrelation coefficient is defined with a standardized
residual vector and a normalized spatial weight matrix. Then on the analogy of
the Durbin-Watson statistic, a serial correlation index is constructed. As a
case, the two statistics are applied to the spatial sample of 29 China's
regions. These results show that the new spatial autocorrelation model can be
used to test the serial correlation of residuals from regression analysis. In
practice, the new statistics can make up for the deficiency of the
Durbin-Watson test.

find that the choice of initial mass functions (IMFs) can introduce a factor of

constrained by data. We perform a joint analysis of weak-lensing and stellar
kinematics data available for the Hydra A cluster, which allows us to constrain
the central mass profile without assuming specific IMFs. We find that the
central mass profile ($r<300$kpc) determined from the joint analysis is in
excellent agreement with those from independent measurements, including
dynamical masses estimated from the cold gas disk component, X-ray hydrostatic
total mass estimates, and the central stellar mass estimated based on the

tedious and expensive, and finding tweets that cover all the classes of
interest is not always straightforward, especially when some of the classes do
not frequently arise in practice. In this paper we study an approach to tweet
classification based on distant supervision, whereby we automatically transfer
labels from one social medium to another for a single-label multi-class

training the same classifier with a limited amount of manually labelled data;
this is advantageous, given that the automatically labelled data come at no

i.i.d. observations that we defined in Baraud et al. (2014). For a
\rho-estimator based on some model S (which means that the estimator belongs to
S) and a true distribution of the observations that also belongs to S, the risk
(with squared Hellinger loss) is bounded by a quantity which can be viewed as a
dimension function of the model and is often related to the ""metric dimension""
of this model, as defined in Birg\'e (2006). This is a minimax point of view
and it is well-known that it is pessimistic. Typically, the bound is accurate
for most points in the model but may be very pessimistic when the true
distribution belongs to some specific part of it. This is the situation that we
want to investigate here. For some models, like the set of decreasing densities
on [0,1], there exist specific points in the model that we shall call
""extremal"" and for which the risk is substantially smaller than the typical
risk. Moreover, the risk at a non-extremal point of the model can be bounded by
the sum of the risk bound at a well-chosen extremal point plus the square of
its distance to this point. This implies that if the true density is close
enough to an extremal point, the risk at this point may be smaller than the
minimax risk on the model and this actually remains true even if the true
density does not belong to the model. The result is based on some refined
bounds on the suprema of empirical processes that are established in Baraud

primitive genera in dimension 3 and 4. Our method breaks up into two parts. The
first part consists of classifying the square free, totally-reflective,
primitive genera by calculating strong bounds on the prime factors of the
determinant of genera of positive definite quadratic forms (lattices) with this
property. We achieve these bounds by combining the Minkowski-Siegel mass
formula with the combinatorial classification of reflective lattices
accomplished by Scharlau \& Blaschke. In a second part, we use a lattice
transformation that goes back to Watson, to generate all totally-reflective,
primitive genera when starting with the square-free case.

$X(3915)$ can possibly be explained if it is an $S-$wave molecular bound state
of $D_s \bar D_s$ meson pair with binding energy about 18\,MeV. In particular,
the decays of $X(3915)$ to pairs of non-strange $D$ mesons are suppressed and
proceed at a rate comparable to that of the decay $X(3915) \to \omega J/\psi$,
whose branching fraction can be as large as about 0.3. Other major types of
decay of $X(3915)$ with a comparable (or slightly smaller) rate are the
transition $X(3915) \to \eta \eta_c$ and the decays into light hadrons due to
the annihilation of the $c \bar c$ quark pair. The existence of a bound state
should lead to an enhancement in the spectrum of the invariant mass for the
$D_s \bar D_s$ near threshold in $B$ decays, e.g. in $B \to K D_s \bar D_s$
which enhancement can be tested experimentally.

estimate the effective temperatures of both stars and to refine their
spectroscopic orbits. We also present new, high-quality photometry covering
both eclipses of V1094 Tau in the Stroemgren uvby system and in the Johnson
V-band. The masses, radii and effective temperatures of the stars in V1094 Tau
are found to be M$_A$ = 1.0965 $\pm$ 0.0040 M$_{\odot}$, R$_A$ = 1.4109 $\pm$

radial velocity data reveals apsidal motion with a period of 14500 $\pm$ 3700
years. The observed masses, radii and effective temperatures are consistent
with stellar models for an age $\approx$ 6 Gyr if the stars are assumed to have
a metallicity similar to the Sun. This estimate is in reasonable agreement with
our estimate of the metallicity derived using Stroemgren photometry and
treating the binary as a single star ([Fe/H] $= -0.09 \pm 0.11$). The rotation
velocities of the stars suggest that V1094 Tau is close to the limit at which
tidal interactions between the stars force them to rotate pseudo-synchronously
with the orbital motion.

peaked (IBL) and high-frequency peaked (HBL) flaring blazars above 100 GeV up
to redshift $z = 0.6$. We show that the best-fit regression line of the emitted
spectral indices $\Gamma_{\rm em} (z)$ is a concave parabola decreasing as $z$
increases, thereby implying a statistical correlation between the
$\{\Gamma_{\rm em} (z) \}$ distribution and $z$. This result contradicts our
expectation that such a distribution should be $z$-independent. We argue that
the above correlation does not arise from any selection bias. We show that our
expectation naturally emerges provided that axion-like particles (ALPs) are put
into the game. Moreover, ALPs can also explain why flat spectrum radio quasars
emit up to 400 GeV, in sharp contradiction with conventional physics. So, the
combination of the two very different but consistent results -- taken at face
value -- leads to a hint at an ALP with mass $m = {\cal O} (10^{-10} \, {\rm
eV})$ and two-photon coupling in the range $2.94 \times 10^{- 12} \, {\rm
GeV}^{- 1} < g_{a \gamma \gamma} < 0.66 \times 10^{- 10} \, {\rm GeV}^{- 1}$.
As a bonus, the Universe would become considerably more transparent above
energies $E \gtrsim 1 \, {\rm TeV}$ than dictated by conventional physics. Our
prediction can be checked not only by the new generation of observatories like
CTA, HAWC, GAMMA-400, LHAASO, TAIGA-HiSCORE and HERD, but also thanks to the
planned laboratory experiments ALPS II (upgraded), STAX, IAXO and with other

on the integration between Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and an enhanced
version of AES. A new quantum symmetric encryption algorithm, which is
abbreviated as Quantum-AES (QAES), is the output of such integration. QAES
depends on generation of dynamic quantum S-Boxes (DQS-Boxes) based quantum

exploits the specific selected secret key generated from the QKD cipher using
two different modes (online and off-line).
