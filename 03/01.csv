Such field detection applications usually employ the NV centers to detect field
components aligned with the direction of the internally-defined spin axis of
the NV center. In this work we detect magnetic fields which are slightly
misaligned with the NV center axis. In particular, we demonstrate that the NV
center can measure the square of the angle between the magnetic field and the
NV center axis with high sensitivity which diverges as the external field
approaches a value pre-defined by NV center's internal parameters, in agreement
with predictions. These results show that NV centers could be used as sensitive

the case in which a light field --the system-- interacts with very heavy fields
in a finite temperature bath. We obtain the reduced density matrix for the
light field, its time evolution is determined by an effective action that
includes the \emph{influence action} from correlations of the heavy degrees of
freedom. The non-equilibrium effective field theory yields a Langevin equation
of motion for the light field in terms of dissipative and noise kernels that
obey a generalized fluctuation dissipation relation. These are completely
determined by the spectral density of the bath which is analyzed in detail for
several cases. At $T=0$ we elucidate the effect of thresholds in the
renormalization aspects and the asymptotic emergence of a local effective field
theory with unitary time evolution. At $T\neq 0$ new ""anomalous"" thresholds
arise, in particular the \emph{decay} of the environmental heavy fields into
the light field leads to \emph{dissipative} dynamics of the light field. Even
when the heavy bath particles are thermally suppressed this dissipative
contribution leads to the \emph{thermalization} of the light field which is
confirmed by a quantum kinetics analysis. We obtain the quantum master equation
and show explicitly that its solution in the field basis is precisely the
influence action that determines the effective non-equilibrium field theory.
The Lindblad form of the quantum master equation features \emph{time dependent
dissipative coefficients}. Their time dependence is crucial to extract
renormalization effects at asymptotically long time. The dynamics from the
quantum master equation is in complete agreement with that of the effective
action, Langevin dynamics and quantum kinetics, thus providing a unified
framework to effective field theory out of equilibrium.

distributions almost surely and, therefore, automatically induce exchangeable
random partitions. Here we focus on the family of Gibbs-type priors, a recent
and elegant generalization of the Dirichlet and the Pitman-Yor process priors.
These random probability measures share properties that are appealing both from
a theoretical and an applied point of view: (i) they admit an intuitive
characterization in terms of their predictive structure justifying their use in
terms of a precise assumption on the learning mechanism; (ii) they stand out in
terms of mathematical tractability; (iii) they include several interesting

our paper is to provide a systematic and unified treatment of Gibbs-type priors

deal with their distributional properties, the resulting estimators,
frequentist asymptotic validation and the construction of time-dependent

same time, three-dimensional spherical simulations of convectively driven
dynamos reproduce a similar diversity, which is commonly obtained either with
Boussinesq models or with more realistic models based on the anelastic
approximation, which take into account the variation of the density with depth
throughout the convection zone. Nevertheless, a conclusion from different
anelastic studies is that dipolar solutions seem more difficult to obtain as
soon as substantial stratifications are considered. In this paper, we aim at
clarifying this point by investigating in more detail the influence of the
density stratification on dipolar dynamos. To that end, we rely on a systematic
parameter study that allows us to clearly follow the evolution of the stability
domain of the dipolar branch as the density stratification is increased. The
impact of the density stratification both on the dynamo onset and the dipole
collapse is discussed and compared to previous Boussinesq results. Furthermore,
our study indicates that the loss of the dipolar branch does not ensue from a
specific modification of the dynamo mechanisms related to the background
stratification, but could instead result from a bias as our observations
naturally favour a certain domain in the parameter space characterized by
moderate values of the Ekman number, owing to current computational
limitations. Moreover, we also show that the critical magnetic Reynolds number
of the dipolar branch is scarcely modified by the increase of the density
stratification, which provides an important insight into the global
understanding of the impact of the density stratification on the stability
domain of the dipolar dynamo branch.

fluctuations, ice coarsening and characteristic time scales extending from
picoseconds to milliseconds. Here, we discuss implications of these time scales
as they pertain to two-phase coexistence and to molecular simulations of
supercooled water. Specifically, we argue that it is possible to discount
liquid-liquid criticality because the time scales imply that correlation
lengths for such behavior would be bounded by no more than a few nanometers.
Similarly, it is possible to discount two-liquid coexistence because the time
scales imply a bounded interfacial free energy that cannot grow in proportion
to a macroscopic surface area. From time scales alone, therefore, we see that
coexisting domains of differing density in supercooled water can be no more
than nano-scale transient fluctuations.

detection around active stars by optimizing the use of Doppler Imaging in
radial velocity measurements. We propose a simple method to simultaneously
extract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographic
inversion technique derived from classical Doppler mapping. Based on the
maximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set of
orbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resulting
Doppler map. We carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform a
preliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual Doppler
map of the very active star HR 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data set
for various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit.
Using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peak
activity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radial
velocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planet
down to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocity
scatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). One
noticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation,
in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radial
velocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustly
recovered. The present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbital
parameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when more
classical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. It is easily
adaptable to most existing Doppler Imaging codes, paving the way towards a
systematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.

We evaluate and compare two scenarios, depending on what WoM disseminates: (1)
vaccine advertising, which may occur whether or not an epidemic is ongoing and
(2) epidemic status, notably disease prevalence. Understanding the synergy
between the two strategies could be particularly important for organizing

epidemic, vaccination uptake is determined more by vaccine advertising than the
epidemic status. As the epidemic progresses, epidemic status become
increasingly important for vaccination uptake, considerably accelerating
vaccination uptake toward a stable vaccination coverage.

topology discovery, or train inauguration, whereby nodes learn in a distributed
fashion the physical topology of the backbone network. While the current
standard for train inauguration assumes wired links between adjacent backbone
nodes, this work investigates the more challenging scenario in which the nodes
communicate wirelessly. The key motivations for this desired switch from wired
topology discovery to wireless one are the flexibility and capability for
expansion and upgrading of a wireless backbone. The implementation of topology
discovery over wireless channels is made difficult by the broadcast nature of
the wireless medium, and by fading and interference. A novel topology discovery
protocol is proposed that overcomes these issues and requires relatively minor
changes to the wired standard. The protocol is shown via analysis and numerical
results to be robust to the impairments caused by the wireless channel

important role in graph minor theory. An interesting aspect of tangles is that
they cannot only be defined for graphs, but more generally for arbitrary
connectivity functions (that is, integer-valued submodular and symmetric set
functions).
  However, tangles are difficult to deal with algorithmically. To start with,
it is unclear how to represent them, because they are families of separations
and as such may be exponentially large. Our first contribution is a data
structure for representing and accessing all tangles of a graph up to some
fixed order.
  Using this data structure, we can prove an algorithmic version of a very
general structure theorem due to Carmesin, Diestel, Harman and Hundertmark (for
graphs) and Hundertmark (for arbitrary connectivity functions) that yields a
canonical tree decomposition whose parts correspond to the maximal tangles.

surface area and its Coulomb self energy. A ball minimizes the former and
maximizes the latter, but the conjecture is that a ball is always a minimizer

  Cross-border Exchange of Balancing Services in Presence of Uncertainty -
  Extended Version",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Considering that the existing setup of the European electricity markets
promotes the spatial coordination of neighbouring power systems only on the
day-ahead market stage, regional system operators have to rely mainly on their
internal balancing resources in order to guarantee system security. However, as
power systems are forced to operate closer to their technical limits, where
flexible generation becomes scarce, the conventional market paradigm may not be
able to respond effectively on the wide range of uncertainty. The operational
flexibility of the power system depends both on the technical parameters of its
components, i.e., generators and transmission infrastructure, as well as on the
operational practices that make optimal use of the available assets. This work
focuses on alternative market designs that enable sharing of cross-border
balancing resources between adjacent power systems through High Voltage Direct
Current (HVDC) interconnections which provide increased controllability. In
this context, we formulate a stochastic market-clearing algorithm that attains
full spatio-temporal integration of reserve capacity, day-ahead and balancing
markets. Against this benchmark we compare two deterministic market designs
with varying degrees of coordination between the reserve capacity and energy
services, both followed by a real-time mechanism. Our study reveals the
inefficiency of deterministic approaches as the shares of wind power increase.
Nevertheless, enforcing a tighter coordination between the reserves and energy
trading floors may improve considerably the expected system cost compared to a
sequential market design. Aiming to provide some insights for improvement of
the sequential market-clearing, we analyse the effect of explicit transmission
allocation between energy and reserves for different HVDC capacities and
identify the market dynamics that dictate the optimal ratio.

Large-scale data resources and NLP allow modern versions of these tools to
avoid the problems of having sparse data and also provide for deep recall

the perspective of the network participant, because the agent must undertake an
action to use the information resources. Emerging ""active"" methods and tools
utilize the same types of information and technologies, but actively intervene

arranging virtual or physical interactions. Active approaches can achieve very

different from that drawn by standard quantum mechanics (SQM): Particles are at
any time at a definite position, and the universe evolves deterministically.
Astonishingly, according to a proof by Bohm the empirical predictions of these
two very different theories coincide. From the very beginning, BM has faced all
kinds of criticism, most of which are either technical or philosophical. There
is, however, a criticism first raised by Correggi et al. (2002) and recently
strengthened by Kiukas and Werner (2010), which holds that, in spite of Bohm's
proof, the predictions of BM do not agree with those of SQM in the case of
local position measurements on entangled particles in a stationary state.
Hence, given that SQM has been proven to be tremendously successful in the
past, BM could most likely not be considered an empirically adequate theory. My
aim is to resolve the conflict by showing that 1) it relies on hidden
differences in the conceptual thinking, and that 2) the predictions of both
theories approximately coincide if the process of measurement is adequately
accounted for. My analysis makes no use of any sort of wavefunction collapse,
refuting a widespread belief that an ""effective collapse"" is needed to
reconcile BM with the predictions of SQM.

spin-polarization of the longitudinal current ($P^L$) in Co$_2$FeX (X = Al, Ga,
In, Al$_{0.5}$Si$_{0.5}$ and Sn) is $\sim$100 \% even though that of the
electronic states at the Fermi level ($P^D$) is not. Further, the other

experiments. Secondly, the calculated anomalous Hall conductivities (AHCs) are
moderate, being within 200 S/cm, and agree well with the available experiments
on highly L2$_1$ ordered Co$_2$FeSi specimen although they differ significantly
from the reported experiments on other compounds where the B2 antisite
disorders were present. Surprisingly, the AHC in Co$_2$FeSi decreases and then
changes sign when Si is replaced by Ge and finally by Sn. Third, the calculated
total magnetic moments agree well with the corresponding experimental ones in
all the studied compounds except Co$_2$FeSi where a difference of 0.3
$\mu_B$/f.u. exists. We also perform the GGA plus on-site Coulomb interaction
$U$ calculations in the GGA+$U$ scheme. We find that including the $U$ affects
the calculated total magnetic moment, spin polarization and AHC significantly,

routing and processing components involved in microwave readout chains for a

superconducting quantum information, where the devices also need to have
minimal photon losses to preserve the quantum coherence of signals.
Conventional commercial implementations of each device suffer from losses and
are built from very different physical principles, which has led to separate
strategies for the construction of their quantum-limited versions. However, as
recently proposed theoretically, by establishing simultaneous pairwise
conversion and/or gain processes between three modes of a Josephson-junction
based superconducting microwave circuit, it is possible to endow the circuit
with the functions of either a phase-preserving directional amplifier or a
circulator. Here, we experimentally demonstrate these two modes of operation of
the same circuit. Furthermore, in the directional amplifier mode, we show that
the noise performance is comparable to standard non-directional superconducting
amplifiers, while in the circulator mode, we show that the sense of circulation
is fully reversible. Our device is far simpler in both modes of operation than
previous proposals and implementations, requiring only three microwave pumps.
It offers the advantage of flexibility, as it can dynamically switch between
modes of operation as its pump conditions are changed. Moreover, by
demonstrating that a single three-wave process yields non-reciprocal devices
with reconfigurable functions, our work breaks the ground for the development

many years as the standard techniques for computing electronic states in
crystalline solids. Here we present the first new method in decades, which we
call atomistic $k\cdot p$ theory. In its usual formulation, $k\cdot p$ theory
has the advantage of depending on parameters that are directly related to
experimentally measured quantities, however it is insensitive to the locations
of individual atoms. We construct an atomistic $k\cdot p$ theory by defining
envelope functions on a grid matching the crystal lattice. The model parameters
are matrix elements which are obtained from experimental results or {\it ab
initio} wave functions in a simple way. This is in contrast to the other
atomistic approaches in which parameters are fit to reproduce a desired
dispersion and are not expressible in terms of fundamental quantities. This
fitting is often very difficult. We illustrate our method by constructing a
four-band atomistic model for a diamond/zincblende crystal and show that it is
equivalent to the $sp^3$ tight-binding model. We can thus directly derive the
parameters in the $sp^3$ tight-binding model from experimental data. We then
take the atomistic limit of the widely used eight-band Kane model and compute
the band structures for all III-V semiconductors not containing nitrogen or
boron using parameters fit to experimental data. Our new approach extends
$k\cdot p$ theory to problems in which atomistic precision is required, such as
impurities, alloys, polytypes, and interfaces. It also provides a new approach
to multiscale modeling by allowing continuum and atomistic $k\cdot p$ models to
be combined in the same system.

among the generators in each stage of Eratosthenes sieve. This recursion
provides explicit enumerations of sequences of gaps among the generators, which
sequences are known as constellations.
  Over the last year we identified a discrete linear system that exactly models
the population of any gap across all stages of the sieve. In August 2014 we
summarized our results from analyzing this discrete model on populations of
single gaps. This paper extends the discrete system to model the populations of
constellations of gaps.
  The most remarkable result is a strong Polignac result on arithmetic
progressions. We had previously established that the equivalent of Polignac's
conjecture holds for Eratosthenes sieve -- that every even number arises as a
gap in the sieve, and its population converges toward the ratio implied by
Hardy and Littlewood's Conjecture B. Extending that work to constellations, we
here establish that for any even gap $g$, if $p$ is the maximum prime such that
$p\# \; | g$ and $P$ is the next prime larger than $p$, then for every $2 \le
j_1 < P-1$, the constellation $g,g,\ldots,g$ of length $j_1$ arises in
Eratosthenes sieve. This constellation corresponds to an arithmetic progression
of $j_1+1$ consecutive candidate primes.

superconductivity. It is obvious that the interaction with large energy scale
is responsible for high critical temperature $T_c$. The Coulomb interaction is
one of candidates that bring about high-temperature superconductivity because
its characteristic energy is of the order of eV. There have been many works for
the Hubbard model including three-band d-p model with the on-site Coulomb
repulsion to investigate a possibility of high-temperature superconductivity.
It is, of course, not trivial whether the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to
a pairing interaction between two electrons. We argue that high-temperature
superconductivity is possible in the strongly correlated region by using the
variational Monte Carlo method for the two-dimensional t-U-J-V model. The
exchange interaction J and the nearest-neighbour attractive interaction V
cooperate with U and will act to enhance the critical temperature.

law of exponent $-0.5$. While both models have been applied to Internet
modeling, this inconsistency requires the verification of their validation.
Therefore we empirically study the fluctuation of Internet of three different
time intervals(daily, monthly and yearly). We find a crossover transition from
PA model to Gibrat's law, which has never been reported. Specifically
Gibrat-law starts from small degree region and extends gradually with the
increase of the observed period. We determine the validated periods for both
models and find that the correlation between internal links has large

classical walks they have been used to find new (quantum) algorithms. When
studying the behavior of large graphs or combinations of graphs it is useful to
find the response of a subgraph to signals of different frequencies. In so
doing we can replace an entire subgraph with a single vertex with frequency
dependent scattering coefficients.
  In this paper a simple technique for quickly finding the scattering
coefficients of any quantum graph will be presented. These scattering
coefficients can be expressed entirely in terms of the characteristic
polynomial of the graph's time step operator. Moreover, with these in hand we
can easily derive the ""impulse response"" which is the key to predicting the
response of a graph to any signal. This gives us a powerful set of tools for
rapidly understanding the behavior of graphs or for reducing a large graph into
its constituent subgraphs regardless of how they are connected.

introduced by Blackwell in the 1950s, along with geometric conditions for

the (convex) target set. Recently, Abernethy, Batlett and Hazan (2011) proposed
a class of approachability algorithms that rely on the no-regret properties of
Online Linear Programming for computing a suitable sequence of steering

and then generalized to any convex set by embedding it in a higher-dimensional
convex cone. In this paper we present a more direct formulation that relies on
the support function of the set, along with suitable Online Convex Optimization

meaningful covariance structures for Gaussian random fields (GRFs) since the

marginal variance of one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional
Mat\'ern GRFs with fixed smoothness. The prior is weakly informative and
penalises complexity by shrinking the range towards infinity and the marginal

and a simulation study shows that the new prior provides a principled
alternative to reference priors that can leverage prior knowledge to achieve
shorter credible intervals while maintaining good coverage.
  We extend the prior to a non-stationary GRF parametrized through local ranges

hyperparameters based on the coverage of the parameters when fitting simulated

concervative estimates of non-stationarity and improved predictive performance

concentric rings around the Galactic center, opening in the direction of the
Milky Way's spiral arms. The northern ring, 9 kpc from the Sun, is easily

automaton recognizing all cycles in the weighted graph corresponding to every

easily integrated into well-established optoelectronic devices. However, the
inherent random nature of the quantum dot growth processes results in a lack of
control of their emission properties. This represents a major roadblock towards
the exploitation of these quantum emitters in the foreseen applications. This
chapter describes a novel class of quantum dot devices that uses the combined

In our recent work, we have found that the cusp and the fold summations are not

inner side of the caustic. Based on the magnification invariant theory, which
states that the sum of signed magnifications of the total images of a given

the sources are slightly deviated from the cusps. In addition, through the

showed that CC is also the class of languages decided by polynomial size
comparator circuits.
  We study generalizations of the comparator circuit model that work over fixed
finite bounded posets. We observe that there are universal comparator circuits
even over arbitrary fixed finite bounded posets. Building on this, we show that
general (resp. skew) comparator circuits of polynomial size over fixed finite
distributive lattices characterizes CC (resp. L). Complementing this, we show
that general comparator circuits of polynomial size over arbitrary fixed finite

addition, we show a characterization of the class NP by a family of polynomial
sized comparator circuits over fixed {\em finite bounded posets}. These results
generalize the results by Cook, Filmus and Le (2012) regarding the power of
comparator circuits. As an aside, we consider generalizations of Boolean
formulae over arbitrary lattices. We show that Spira's theorem (1971) can be
extended to this setting as well and show that polynomial sized Boolean

multi-dimensional Particle-In-Cell code was developed and applied to answer key
questions in plasma-based accelerator research. The simulations increase the
understanding of the processes in laser plasma and beam-plasma interaction,
allow for comparison with experiments, and motivate the development of
theoretical models.
  The simulations support the idea that the injection of electrons in a plasma
wave by using a transversely propagating laser pulse is possible. The beam
parameters of the injected electrons found in the simulations compare
reasonably with beams produced by conventional methods and therefore laser
injection is an interesting concept for future plasma-based accelerators.
  Simulations of the optical guiding of a laser wakefield driver in a parabolic
plasma channel support the idea that electrons can be accelerated over
distances much longer than the Rayleigh length in a channel. Simulations of
plasma wakefield acceleration in the nonlinear blowout regime give a detailed
picture of of the highly nonlinear processes involved. Using OSIRIS, we have
also been able to perform full scale simulations of the E-157 experiment at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. These simulations have aided the
experimentalists and they have assisted in the development of a theoretical

time. When time is discrete and only the relationships between the
participating entities may change and not the entities themselves, a temporal
graph may be viewed as a sequence $G_1,G_2\ldots,G_l$ of static graphs over the
same (static) set of nodes $V$. Though static graphs have been extensively
studied, for their temporal generalization we are still far from having a
concrete set of structural and algorithmic principles. Recent research shows
that many graph properties and problems become radically different and usually
substantially more difficult when an extra time dimension in added to them.
Moreover, there is already a rich and rapidly growing set of modern systems and
applications that can be naturally modeled and studied via temporal graphs.
This, further motivates the need for the development of a temporal extension of
graph theory. We survey here recent results on temporal graphs and temporal
graph problems that have appeared in the Computer Science community.

surface density (sigmasfr) and mass surface density of molecular gas
(sigmahtwo), commonly referred to as the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation, at
its intrinsic spatial scale, i.e. the size of giant molecular clouds (10-150
pc), in the central, high-density regions of four nearby low-luminosity active
galactic nuclei (AGN). We used interferometric IRAM CO(1-0) and CO(2-1), and
SMA CO(3-2) emission line maps to derive sigmahtwo and HST-Halpha images to
estimate sigmasfr. Each galaxy is characterized by a distinct molecular SF
relation at spatial scales between 20 to 200 pc. The K-S relations can be
sub-linear, but also super-linear, with slopes ranging from 0.5 to 1.3.
Depletion times range from 1 and 2Gyr, compatible with results for nearby
normal galaxies. These findings are valid independently of which transition,
CO(1-0), CO(2-1), or CO(3-2), is used to derive sigmahtwo. Because of
star-formation feedback, life-time of clouds, turbulent cascade, or magnetic
fields, the K-S relation might be expected to degrade on small spatial scales
(<100 pc). However, we find no clear evidence for this, even on scales as small
as 20 pc, and this might be because of the higher density of GMCs in galaxy
centers which have to resist higher shear forces. The proportionality between
sigmahtwo and sigmasfr found between 10 and 100 Msun/pc2 is valid even at high
densities, 10^3 Msun/pc2. However, by adopting a common CO-to-H2 conversion
factor (alpha_CO), the central regions of the galaxies have higher sigmasfr for
a given gas column than those expected from the models, with a behavior that
lies between the mergers/high-redshift starburst systems and the more quiescent
star-forming galaxies, assuming that the first ones require a lower value of
alpha_CO.

energy is a subject of great importance. Especially, this concerns microwave
spectroscopic characterization of biological liquids. Use of effective testing
methods to obtain information about physical properties of different liquids on
the molecular level is one of the most important problems in biophysics.
However, the standard methods based on the microwave resonant techniques are
not sufficiently suitable for biological liquids because the resonance peak in
a resonator with high-loss liquids is so broad that the material parameters
cannot be measured correctly. Although molecular vibrations of biomolecules may
have microwave frequencies, it is not thought that such resonant coupling is
significant due to their low energy compared with thermal energy and the
strongly dampening aqueous environment. This paper presents an innovative
microwave sensing technique for different types of lossy materials, including
biological liquids. The technique is based on the combination of the microwave
perturbation method and the Fano-resonance effects observed recently in
microwave structures with embedded magnetic-dipolar quantum dots. When
frequency of the magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) resonance is not equal to the
cavity resonance frequency, one gets Fano transmission intensity. With tuning,
by a bias magnetic field, the MDM resonance frequency to the cavity resonance
frequency, one observes a Lorentz line shape. Use of an extremely narrow
Lorentzian peak allows exact probing the resonant frequency of a cavity loaded
by a high-lossy-material sample. For different kinds of samples, one has
different frequencies of Lorentzian peaks. This gives a picture for precise
spectroscopic characterization of high absorption matter in microwaves.

$X$ is $1-2/(3k(k-1))$.

verifying whether intersection of a regular language -- the input of the
problem -- and fixed language called filter is non-empty. In this paper we
focus on the case of context-free filters. Algorithmic complexity of the RR
problem is a very coarse measure of context-free languages complexity. This
characteristic is compatible with rational dominance. We present examples of
P-complete RR problems as well as examples of RR problems in the class NL. Also
we discuss RR problems with context-free filters that might have intermediate
complexity. Possible candidates are the languages with polynomially bounded
rational indices.

question is worth of investigation due to application for one-dimensional
nanostructures. The main result is the physical interpretation of peculiar
self-adjoint extension with discontinuity of both the probability density and
the derivative of the wave function. We show that this case differs very much
from other three which were considered before and corresponds to the presence
of mass-jump in a sense of works of Ganella et. al., (Journal of Physics A:
Mathematical and Theoretical 42, 465207 (2009)) along with the quantized
magnetic flux. Real physical system which can be modeled by such boundary
conditions is the localized quantazied flux in the Josephson junction of two
superconductors with different effective masses of the elementary excitations.

  Estimation Methods","A submitted paper",,"10.1109/TSP.2016.2580533",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many practical parameter estimation problems, prescreening and parameter
selection are performed prior to estimation. In this paper, we consider the
problem of estimating a preselected unknown deterministic parameter chosen from
a parameter set based on observations according to a predetermined selection
rule, $\Psi$. The data-based parameter selection process may impact the
subsequent estimation by introducing a selection bias and creating coupling
between decoupled parameters. This paper introduces a post-selection mean
squared error (PSMSE) criterion as a performance measure. A corresponding
Cram\'er-Rao-type bound on the PSMSE of any $\Psi$-unbiased estimator is
derived, where the $\Psi$-unbiasedness is in the Lehmann-unbiasedness sense.
The post-selection maximum-likelihood (PSML) estimator is presented .It is
proved that if there exists an $\Psi$-unbiased estimator that achieves the
$\Psi$-Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), i.e. an $\Psi$-efficient estimator, then it is
produced by the PSML estimator. In addition, iterative methods are developed
for the practical implementation of the PSML estimator. Finally, the proposed
$\Psi$-CRB and PSML estimator are examined in estimation after parameter
selection with different distributions.
