large disc galaxies of the Local Group, we present the first deep, wide-field
(42' x 56') 3D-spectroscopic survey of the ionized gas disc of Messier 33.
Fabry-Perot interferometry has been used to map its Ha distribution and
kinematics at unprecedented angular resolution (<3'') and resolving power
(12600), with the 1.6m telescope at the Observatoire du Mont Megantic. The
ionized gas distribution follows a complex, large-scale spiral structure,
unsurprisingly coincident with the already-known spiral structures of the
neutral and molecular gas discs. The kinematical analysis of the velocity field
shows that the rotation center of the Ha disc is distant from the photometric
center by 170 pc (sky projected distance) and that the kinematical major-axis
position angle and disc inclination are in excellent agreement with photometric
values. The Ha rotation curve agrees very well with the HI rotation curves for
0 < R < 6.5 kpc, but the Ha velocities are 10-20 km/s higher for R > 6.5 kpc.
The reason for this discrepancy is not well understood. The velocity dispersion
profile is relatively flat around 16 km/s, which is at the low end of velocity
dispersions of nearby star-forming galactic discs. A strong relation is also
found between the Ha velocity dispersion and the Ha intensity. Mass models were
obtained using the Ha rotation curve but, as expected, the dark matter halo's
parameters are not very well constrained since the optical rotation curve only
extends out to 8 kpc.

and propagation of order by Markov processes is established. The order
propagation has received considerable attention in the literature, however,
this notion is still not fully understood. The main contribution of this paper
is a study of the order propagation in the deterministic setting, which
potentially can provide new techniques for analysis in the stochastic one. We
take a close look at the propagation of the so-called increasing and increasing
convex orders. Infinitesimal characterisations of these orders are derived,
which resemble the well-known Kamke conditions for monotonicity. It is shown
that increasing order is equivalent to the standard monotonicity, while the
class of systems propagating the increasing convex order is equivalent to the
class of monotone systems with convex vector fields. The paper is concluded by
deriving a novel result on order propagating diffusion processes and an
application of this result to biological processes.

fluctuations of stochastic efficiency/coefficient of performance (COP) dominate
their mean values. Their distributions show power law tails, however the

planets in these systems are in notably differing orbits with eccentricities
between 0.08 (about Mars) and 0.72. We consider the stellar UV environments
provided by the photospheric stellar radiation, which allows us to compute the
UV habitable zones for the systems. Following previous studies, DNA is taken as
a proxy for carbon-based macromolecules following the paradigm that
extraterrestrial biology might be based on hydrocarbons. We found that the
damage inflicted on DNA is notably different for the range of systems studied,

of damage are attained compared to today's Earth or during the Archean eon.

their extremely red mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
compact radio counterparts. Further investigations show that they are highly
obscured, have abundant warm AGN-heated dust and are thought to be experiencing
intense AGN feedback. These galaxies appear to be consistent with an
AGN-dominated galaxy, and could be a transient phase of merging galaxies. When
comparing the number of submm galaxies (SMGs) detected serendipitously in the
surrounding 1.5-arcmin to those in blank-field submm surveys, there is a very
significant overdensity, of order 5, but no sign of radial clustering centred
at our primary objects. The WISE/radio-selected AGN thus reside in 10-Mpc-scale
overdense environments, that could be forming in pre-viralised clusters of
galaxies. WISE/radio-selected AGNs appear to be the strongest signposts of
high-density regions of active, luminous and dusty galaxies. SCUBA-2 850microns
observations indicate that their submm fluxes are low compared to many popular
AGN SED templates, hence the WISE/radio-selected AGNs have either less cold

the targets are not detected, only four targets are detected at SCUBA-2

Non-stationary noises can be considered as one of these audio sources with

individual stars consistent with the expected isochrone and luminosity function
of an old and metal-poor stellar population. The objects span a wide range of
absolute magnitudes (M_V from -2.2 mag to -7.4 mag), physical sizes (10 pc to
170 pc), and heliocentric distances (30 kpc to 330 kpc). Based on the low
surface brightnesses, large physical sizes, and/or large Galactocentric
distances of these objects, several are likely to be new ultra-faint satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way and/or Magellanic Clouds. We introduce a
likelihood-based algorithm to search for and characterize stellar
over-densities, as well as identify stars with high satellite membership
probabilities. We also present completeness estimates for detecting ultra-faint
galaxies of varying luminosities, sizes, and heliocentric distances in the

systems, we explore a large parameter space of isolated pure-disk simulations.
We show that a dynamically cool inner disk embedded in a hotter outer disk can
naturally generate a steady secondary bar while the outer disk forms a
large-scale primary bar. The independent bar instabilities of inner and outer
disks result in long-lived double-barred structures whose dynamical properties
are comparable with observations. This formation scenario indicates that the
secondary bar might form from the general bar instability, the same as the
primary bar. Under some circumstances, the interaction of the bars and the disk
leads to the two bars aligning or single, nuclear, bars only. Simulations that
are cool enough of the center to experience clump instabilities may also
generate steady double-barred galaxies. In this case, the secondary bars are
""fast"", i.e., the bar length is close to the co-rotation radius. This is the
first time that double-barred galaxies containing a fast secondary bar are
reported. Previous orbit-based studies had suggested that fast secondary bars
are not dynamically possible.

models. The nuclear rings formed in our simulations can be divided into two
groups: one group is nearly round and the other is highly elongated. We find
that roundish rings may not form when the bar pattern speed is too high or the
bulge central density is too low. We also study the periodic orbits in our
galaxy models, and find that the concept of inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) may
be generalized by the extent of $x_2$ orbits. All roundish nuclear rings in our
simulations settle in the range of $x_2$ orbits (or ILRs). However, knowing the
resonances is insufficient to pin down the exact location of these nuclear
rings. We suggest that the backbone of round nuclear rings is the $x_2$ orbital
family, i.e. round nuclear rings are allowed only in the radial range of $x_2$
orbits. A round nuclear ring forms exactly at the radius where the residual
angular momentum of infalling gas balances the centrifugal force, which can be
described by a parameter $f_{\rm ring}$ measured from the rotation curve. The
gravitational torque on gas in high pattern speed models is larger, leading to
a smaller ring size than in the low pattern speed models. Our result may have
important implications for using nuclear rings to measure the parameters of
real barred galaxies with 2D gas kinematics.

$\Gamma\propto\frac{1}{H}$, we show that this model can be distinguished from

applications. Previous theory mainly provides conditions for completion under
missing-at-random samplings. This paper studies deterministic conditions for
completion. An incomplete $d \times N$ matrix is finitely rank-$r$ completable
if there are at most finitely many rank-$r$ matrices that agree with all its
observed entries. Finite completability is the tipping point in LRMC, as a few
additional samples of a finitely completable matrix guarantee its unique
completability. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic sampling
condition for finite completability. We use this to also derive deterministic
sampling conditions for unique completability that can be efficiently verified.
We also show that under uniform random sampling schemes, these conditions are
satisfied with high probability if $O(\max\{r,\log d\})$ entries per column are
observed. These findings have several implications on LRMC regarding lower

observed thanks to the CoRoT and Kepler missions. This is particularly true of
evolved (sub-giant and giant) stars, and has led various groups to investigate
their rotation profiles via different methods.
  Aims: We would like to set up some criteria which will help us to know
whether a decreasing rotation profile, or one which satisfies Rayleigh's
stability criterion, is compatible with a set of observed rotational splittings
for a given reference model.
  Methods: We derive inequalities on the rotational splittings using a
reformulated version of the equation which relates the splittings to the
rotation profile and kernels.
  Results: These inequalities are tested out on some simple examples. The first
examples show how they are able to reveal when a rotation profile is increasing
somewhere or inconsistent with Rayleigh's criterion in a main sequence star,
depending on the profile and the $\ell$ values of the splittings. The next
example illustrates how a slight mismatch between an observed evolved star and
a reference model can lead to erroneous conclusions about the rotation profile.
We also show how frequency differences between the star and the model, which
should normally reveal this mismatch, can be masked by frequency corrections
for near-surface effects.

the dissipative dynamics of a quantum system weakly coupled to one or several
heat baths. The dissipative structure is driven by an entropic operator, the so
called modular Hamiltonian, which makes it nonlinear. The generated Modular
Dynamical Semigroup (MDS) is not, in general, a Quantum Dynamical Semigroup
(QDS), whose dynamics is of the popular Lindblad type. The MDS has a robust
thermodynamic structure, which guarantees for the positivity of the time
evolved state, the correct steady state properties, the positivity of the
entropy production, a positive Onsager matrix and Onsager symmetry relations
(arising from Green-Kubo formulas). We show that the celebrated Davies
generator, obtained through the Born and the secular approximations, generates
a MDS. By unravelling the modular structure of the former, we provide a
different and genuinely nonlinear MDS, not of QDS type, which is free from the
severe spectral restrictions of the Davies generator, while still being
supported by a weak coupling limit argument. With respect to the latter, the
present work is a substantial extension of

that, in the regime where self-gravitational effects are weak, intermediate and
wider wave-functions may be approximated by a harmonic potential as well, but

which data is presented serially in time to a learning agent, requiring it to
progressively adapt within the constraints of the learning algorithm. More
sophisticated variants may involve concepts such as transfer-learning which
increase this adaptive capability, enhancing the learner's cognitive capacities
in a manner that can begin to imitate the open-ended learning capabilities of
human beings.
  We shall argue in this paper, however, that a full realization of this notion
requires that, in addition to the capacity to adapt to novel data, autonomous
online learning must ultimately incorporate the capacity to update its own
representational capabilities in relation to the data. We therefore enquire
about the philosophical limits of this process, and argue that only fully
embodied learners exhibiting an a priori perception-action link in order to
ground representational adaptations are capable of exhibiting the full range of
human cognitive capability.

non-thermal processes, Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs)
are excellent targets for the indirect detection of dark matter. Recently,
eight new dSph candidates were discovered using the first year of data from the
Dark Energy Survey (DES). We searched for gamma-ray emission coincident with
the positions of these new objects in six years of Fermi Large Area Telescope
data. We found no significant excesses of gamma-ray emission. Under the
assumption that the DES candidates are dSphs with dark matter halo properties
similar to the known dSphs, we computed individual and combined limits on the
velocity-averaged dark matter annihilation cross section for these new targets.
If the estimated dark-matter content of these dSph candidates is confirmed,
they will constrain the annihilation cross section to lie below the thermal
relic cross section for dark matter particles with masses < 20 GeV annihilating
via the b-bbar or tau+tau- channels.

dark matter halo depends not only on halo mass, but also on the formation
history of the halo. This dependence on the formation history, which is highly
correlated with halo concentration, can account for the super-Poissonian
scatter in subhalo occupation at a fixed halo mass that has been previously
measured in simulations. Here we propose a model to predict the subhalo
abundance function for individual host halos, that incorporates both halo mass
and concentration. We combine results of cosmological simulations with a new
suite of zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass halos to calibrate our model. We
show the model can successfully reproduce the mean and the scatter of subhalo
occupation in these simulations. The implications of this correlation between
subhalo abundance and halo concentration are further investigated. We also
discuss cases in which inferences about halo properties can be affected if this
correlation between subhalo abundance and halo concentration is ignored; in
these cases our model would give a more accurate inference. We propose that
with future deep surveys, satellite occupation in the low-mass regime can be
used to verify the existence of halo assembly bias.

computation of the redshift invariant of a point particle in a circular orbit
about a black hole in linear perturbation theory gives the linear-in-mass-ratio
portion of the binding energy of a circular binary with arbitrary mass ratio.
This binding energy, in turn, encodes the system's conservative dynamics. We
give a method for extracting the analytic forms of these PN coefficients from
high-accuracy numerical data using experimental mathematics techniques, notably
an integer relation algorithm. Such methods should be particularly important
when the calculations progress to the considerably more difficult case of
perturbations of the Kerr metric. As an example, we apply this method to the
redshift invariant in Schwarzschild. Here we obtain analytic coefficients to
12.5PN, and higher-order terms in mixed analytic-numerical form to 21.5PN,
including analytic forms for the complete 13.5PN coefficient, and all the
logarithmic terms at 13PN. At these high orders, an individual coefficient can
have over 30 terms, including a wide variety of transcendental numbers, when
written out in full. We are still able to obtain analytic forms for such
coefficients from the numerical data through a careful study of the structure
of the expansion. The structure we find also allows us to predict certain
""leading logarithm""-type contributions to all orders. The additional terms in
the expansion we obtain improve the accuracy of the PN series for the redshift
observable, even in the very strong-field regime inside the innermost stable
circular orbit, particularly when combined with exponential resummation.

dimension increases average energy approaches to Fermi energy and in infinite
dimension average energy becomes equal to Fermi energy at $T=0$. In this letter

  Branching Processes via Compressed Sensing","18 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Branching processes are a class of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) with
ubiquitous applications. A general difficulty in statistical inference under
partially observed CTMC models arises in computing transition probabilities
when the discrete state space is large or uncountable. Classical methods such
as matrix exponentiation are infeasible for large or countably infinite state
spaces, and sampling-based alternatives are computationally intensive,
requiring a large integration step to impute over all possible hidden events.
Recent work has successfully applied generating function techniques to
computing transition probabilities for linear multitype branching processes.
While these techniques often require significantly fewer computations than
matrix exponentiation, they also become prohibitive in applications with large
populations. We propose a compressed sensing framework that significantly
accelerates the generating function method, decreasing computational cost up to
a logarithmic factor by only assuming the probability mass of transitions is
sparse. We demonstrate accurate and efficient transition probability
computations in branching process models for hematopoiesis and transposable
element evolution.

the circumstellar disk surrounding the young solar analogue HL Tau, with a
pattern of bright and dark rings observed at all wavelengths. By fitting
ellipses to the most distinct rings, we measure precise values for the disk
inclination (46.72pm0.05 degrees) and position angle (+138.02pm0.07 degrees).
We obtain a high-fidelity image of the 1.0 mm spectral index ($\alpha$), which
ranges from $\alpha\sim2.0$ in the optically-thick central peak and two
brightest rings, increasing to 2.3-3.0 in the dark rings. The dark rings are
not devoid of emission, we estimate a grain emissivity index of 0.8 for the
innermost dark ring and lower for subsequent dark rings, consistent with some
degree of grain growth and evolution. Additional clues that the rings arise
from planet formation include an increase in their central offsets with radius
and the presence of numerous orbital resonances. At a resolution of 35 AU, we
resolve the molecular component of the disk in HCO+ (1-0) which exhibits a

around a ~1.3 solar mass star, although complicated by absorption at low

hr interval, which covers 60% of the 7.2 hr rotation period, approximately
centered on local transit. A sequence of ten consecutive images reveals
continuous changes in the asteroid's profile and apparent shape, in good
agreement with the sky projection of the three-dimensional model of the
Database of Asteroid Models from Inversion Techniques. We measure a geometric
mean diameter of 259pm4 km, in good agreement with past estimates from a
variety of techniques and wavelengths. Due to the viewing angle and inclination
of the rotational pole, the southern hemisphere dominates all of the images.
The median peak brightness temperature is 215pm13 K, while the median over the
whole surface is 197pm15 K. With the unprecedented resolution of ALMA, we find
that the brightness temperature varies across the surface with higher values
correlated to the subsolar point and afternoon areas, and lower values beyond
the evening terminator. The dominance of the subsolar point is accentuated in
the final four images, suggesting a reduction in the thermal inertia of the
regolith at the corresponding longitudes, which are possibly correlated to the
location of the putative large impact crater. These results demonstrate ALMA's
potential to resolve thermal emission from the surface of main belt asteroids,
and to measure accurately their position, geometric shape, rotational period,
and soil characteristics.

  We prove that, given a finite congruence-modular Abelian algebra $\bA$, the

can choose a dualizing alter-ego with only relations of arity $\le 1+\alpha^3$,
where $\alpha$ is the largest exponent of a prime in the prime decomposition of

We find that the overall distribution of the DCO$^{+}$ abundance is
qualitatively similar to that of CO but is dominated by thin layer located at
the inner disk surface. To understand its distribution, we investigate the
different key gas-phase deuteration pathways that can lead to the formation of
DCO$^{+}$. Our analysis shows that the recent update in the exothermicity of
the reaction involving CH$_2$D$^{+}$ as a parent molecule of DCO$^{+}$ favors
deuterium fractionation in warmer conditions. As a result the formation of
DCO$^{+}$ is enhanced in the inner warm surface layers of the disk where X-ray
ionization occurs. Our analysis points out that DCO$^{+}$ is not a reliable
tracer of the CO snow line as previously suggested. We thus predict that
DCO$^{+}$ is a tracer of active deuterium and in particular X-ray ionization of
the inner disk.

momentum-driven AGN feedback, self-gravity, star formation and stellar
feedback, focusing on the interplay between cooling, AGN heating and star
formation in an isolated cool-core cluster. Cold clumps triggered by AGN jets
and turbulence form filamentary structures tens of kpc long. This cold gas
feeds both star formation and the supermassive black hole (SMBH), triggering an
AGN outburst that increases the entropy of the ICM and reduces its cooling
rate. Within 1-2 Gyr, star formation completely consumes the cold gas, leading
to a brief shutoff of the AGN. The ICM quickly cools and redevelops multiphase
gas, followed by another cycle of star formation/AGN outburst. Within 6.5 Gyr,
we observe three such cycles. There is good agreement between our simulated
cluster and the observations of cool-core clusters. ICM cooling is dynamically
balanced by AGN heating, and a cool-core appearance is preserved. The minimum
cooling time to free-fall time ratio typically varies between a few and
$\gtrsim 20$. The star formation rate (SFR) covers a wide range, from 0 to a
few hundred $\rm M_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$, with an average of $\sim 40 \,\rm
M_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$. The instantaneous SMBH accretion rate shows large
variations on short timescales, but the average value correlates well with the
SFR. Simulations without stellar feedback or self-gravity produce qualitatively
similar results, but a lower SMBH feedback efficiency (0.1% compared to 1%)
results in too many stars.

candidates at $z$<0.055. From 27 galaxies observed, we have recovered one
previously-known lens (ESO325-G004) at $z$=0.034, and discovered two new
systems, at $z$=0.031 and $z$=0.052. All three lens galaxies have high velocity
dispersions (\sigma>300 km/s) and \alpha-element abundances ([Mg/Fe]>0.3). From
the lensing configurations we derive total J-band mass-to-light ratios of
1.8$\pm$0.1, 2.1$\pm$0.1 and 1.9$\pm$0.2 within the $\sim$2 kpc Einstein
radius. Correcting for estimated dark-matter contributions, and comparing to
stellar population models with a Milky Way (Kroupa) initial mass function
(IMF), we determine the ""mass excess factor"", \alpha. Assuming the lens
galaxies have ""old"" stellar populations (10$\pm$1 Gyr), the average IMF mass
factor is $\langle\alpha\rangle$=1.10$\pm$0.08$\pm$0.10, where the first error
is random and the second is systematic. If we instead fit the stellar
populations from 6dF optical survey spectra, all three galaxies are consistent
with being old, but the age errors are 3-4 Gyr, due to limited signal-to-noise.
The IMF constraints are therefore looser in this case, with
$\langle\alpha\rangle$ = $1.23^{+0.16}_{-0.13}\pm{0.10}$. Our results are thus
consistent with a Kroupa IMF (\alpha=1.00) on average, and strongly reject very
heavy IMFs with \alpha>2. A Salpeter IMF (\alpha=1.55) is inconsistent at the
3.5$\sigma$ level if the galaxies are old, but cannot be excluded using age

to which effects other than gravitational-wave emission can be distinguished
using PTA observations. We show that, even in the absence of a detection, it is
possible to place interesting constraints on these dynamical effects for
conservative predictions of the population of tightly bound supermassive
black-hole binaries. For instance, if we assume a relatively weak signal
consistent with a low number of bound binaries and a low black-hole-mass to
galaxy-mass correlation, we still find that a non-detection by a simulated
array, with a sensitivity that should be reached in practice within a few
years, disfavors gravitational-wave-dominated evolution with an odds ratio of
$\sim$30:1. Such a finding would suggest either that all existing astrophysical
models for the population of tightly bound binaries are overly optimistic, or
else that some dynamical effect other than gravitational-wave emission is
actually dominating binary evolution even at the relatively high
frequencies/small orbital separations probed by PTAs.

stream morphologies become increasingly complex at higher resolution, with
large coherent flows revealing density and temperature structure at

same radius within the halo, making radially averaged analyses misleading. This
is particularly true where the hot, quasi-static, high entropy halo atmosphere
interacts with cold, rapidly inflowing, low entropy accretion. We investigate
the process of gas virialization and identify different regimes for the heating
of gas as it accretes from the intergalactic medium. Haloes at this mass have a
well-defined virial shock, associated with a sharp jump in temperature and
entropy at ~1.25 r_vir. The presence, radius, and radial width of this boundary

from sub-kpc to tens of kpc in size. Grid-cell measurements of low SFRs using
H-alpha emission can be biased and scatter may be introduced because of
non-uniform sampling of the IMF or because of stochastically varying star
formation. In order to alleviate these issues, we use far-ultraviolet emission
to trace SFR, and we sum up the fluxes from different bins with the same gas
surface density to calculate the average $\Sigma_{SFR}$ at a given value of
$\Sigma_{gas}$. We study the resulting Kennicutt-Schmidt relation in 400 pc, 1
kpc and 10 kpc scale grids in nearby massive spirals and in 400 pc scale grids

1.5 in the HI-dominated regions for both kinds of galaxies. The relation is
offset towards longer gas consumption timescales compared to the molecular
hydrogen dominated centres of spirals, but the offset is an order-of-magnitude
less than that quoted by earlier studies. Our results lead to the surprising
conclusion that conversion of gas to stars is independent of metallicity in the
HI dominated regions of star-forming galaxies. Our observed relations are
better fit by a model of star formation based on thermal and hydrostatic
equilibrium in the ISM, in which feedback driven turbulence sets the thermal

before the dispersal of the gas from the protoplanetary disk. The planetesimal

drag. Large protoplanets, $m\sim0.1M_{\oplus}$, are dominated by type I
migration \emph{differential} torque. There is an additional mass range,
$m\sim10^{21}-10^{25}g$ of \emph{intermediate mass} planetesimals (IMPs), where
gravitational interactions with the disk dominate over aerodynamic gas drag,
but for which such interactions were typically neglected. Here we model these
interactions using the \emph{gas dynamical friction} (GDF) approach, previously
used to study the disk-planet interactions at the planetary mass range. We find
the critical size where GDF dominates over gas drag, and then study the
implications of GDF on single IMPs. We find that planetesimals with small
inclinations rapidly become co-planar. Eccentric orbits circularize within a
few Myrs, provided the the planetesimal mass is large, $m\gtrsim10^{23}g$ and
that the initial eccentricity is low, $e\lesssim0.1$. Planetesimals of higher
masses, $m\sim10^{24}-10^{25}g$ inspiral on a time-scale of a few Myrs, leading
to \emph{an embryonic migration} to the inner disk. This can lead to an
over-abundance of rocky material (in the form of IMPs) in the inner
protoplanetary disk ($<1$AU) and induce rapid planetary growth. This can
explain the origin of super-Earth planets. In addition, GDF damps the
velocities of IMPs, thereby cooling the planetesimal disk and affecting its
collisional evolution through quenching the effects of viscous stirring by the
large bodies.

which in turn scatters off nuclei in the IceCube detector. Besides these
events, which are exclusively shower-like, the model also predicts a secondary

3-body decay $\phi \to \chi \bar\chi a$, where $a$ is a pseudoscalar which
mediates dark matter--Standard Model interactions and whose decay products
include neutrinos. This secondary population also includes track-like events,
and both populations together provide an excellent fit to the IceCube data. We
then argue that a relic abundance of light Dark Matter particles $\chi$, which
may constitute a subdominant component of the Dark Matter in the Universe, can
have exactly the right properties to explain the observed excess in GeV gamma
rays from the galactic center region. Our boosted Dark Matter scenario also
predicts fluxes of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV positrons and $\mathcal{O}(100

particle $\phi$, and we show how these can be used to constrain parts of the
viable parameter space of the model. Direct detection limits are weak due to
the pseudoscalar couplings of $\chi$. Accelerator constraints on the
pseudoscalar mediator $a$ lead to the conclusion that the preferred mass of $a$

astrophysical phenomena, among them the collision of two black holes, a system
completely invisible to the eyes of electromagnetic telescopes. Models that
predict gravitational wave signals from likely sources are crucial for the
success of this endeavor. Modeling binary black hole sources of gravitational
radiation requires solving the Eintein equations of General Relativity using
powerful computer hardware and sophisticated numerical algorithms. This
proceeding presents where we are in understanding ground-based gravitational
waves resulting from the merger of black holes and the implications of these
sources for the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy.

device in outdoor conditions, using only an untextured 2D model. Previous
methods compute only a relative pose using a SLAM algorithm, or require many
registered images, which are cumbersome to acquire. By contrast, our method
returns an accurate, absolute camera pose in an absolute referential using
simple 2D+height maps, which are broadly available, to refine a first estimate
of the pose provided by the device's sensors. We show how to first estimate the
camera absolute orientation from straight line segments, and then how to
estimate the translation by aligning the 2D map with a semantic segmentation of
the input image. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach on
a challenging dataset.

systems with classically chaotic dynamics can be accounted for through
correlations between partner periodic orbits with small action differences. So
far, however, the scope of this approach has been mainly limited to systems of
a few particles with low-dimensional phase spaces. In the present work we
consider N-particle chaotic systems with local homogeneous interactions, where
N is not necessarily small. Based on a model of coupled cat maps we demonstrate
emergence of a new mechanism for correlation between periodic orbit actions. In
particular, we show the existence of partner orbits which are specific to
many-particle systems. For a sufficiently large N these new partners dominate
the spectrum of correlating periodic orbits and seem to be necessary for
construction of a consistent many-particle semiclassical theory.

our study of the effectiveness of the raspberry model in reproducing
hydrodynamic interactions in the Stokes regime for spheres arranged in a

Here, we consider the accuracy with which the raspberry model is able to
reproduce such interactions for particles confined between two parallel plates.
To this end, we compare our LB simulation results to established theoretical
expressions and finite-element calculations. We show that there is a
discrepancy between the translational and rotational mobility when only surface
coupling points are used, as also found in Part I of our joint publication. We
demonstrate that adding internal coupling points to the raspberry, can be used
to correct said discrepancy in confining geometries as well. Finally, we show
that the raspberry model accurately reproduces hydrodynamic interactions
between a spherical colloid and planar walls up to roughly one LB lattice
spacing.

couplings are generated in the vicinity of a point and only one family of
quarks and leptons is massive at tree-level. The other two families obtain
their masses when non-perturbative effects are taken into account, being
hierarchically lighter than the third family. However, and contrary to previous
results, we find that this hierarchy of fermion masses is not always
appropriate to reproduce measured data. We find instead that different T-brane
configurations breaking $E_8$ to SU(5) give rise to distinct hierarchical
patterns for the holomorphic Yukawa couplings. Only some of these patterns
allow to fit the observed fermion masses with reasonable local model parameter
values, adding further constraints to the construction of F-theory GUTs. We
consider an $E_8$ model where such appropriate hierarchy is realised and
compute its physical Yukawas, showing that realistic charged fermions masses
can indeed be obtained in this case.

processes enable scatterings that conserve total momentum only up to

vector, significant amounts of spectral weight in the plasmonic excitations at
long wavelength are transferred into lower frequency around mid-infrared
regime. We further find that regardless of the gap symmetry, superconductivity
generally suppresses the Umklapp scatterings due to the formation of the
electron pairing. This suppression is unique for the superconductivity due to
the interplay between electron pairing and the odd parity of the matrix
elements associated with Umklapp channels, which usually does not occur in
other known competing orders. Specific predictions for the experimental
signatures in optical conductivity and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
will be discussed.

enhanced by a new mechanism which does not rely upon a magnetic Feshbach
resonance. In this mechanism, interactions are controlled by tuning the
frequency of an oscillating parallel component of the magnetic field close to
the transition frequency between the scattering atoms and a two-atom bound
state. The real part of the resulting s-wave scattering length $a$ is
resonantly enhanced when the oscillation frequency is close to the transition
frequency. The resonance parameters can be controlled by varying the amplitude
of the oscillating field. The amplitude also controls the imaginary part of $a$
which arises because the oscillating field converts atom pairs into molecules.
The real part of $a$ can be made much larger than the background scattering
length without introducing catastrophic atom losses from the imaginary part.
For the case of a shallow bound state in the scattering channel, the
dimensionless resonance parameters are universal functions of the dimensionless
oscillation amplitude.

$N$-body simulations, implemented in the Ramses adaptive mesh refinement code.
We introduce a refinement criterion that the particle distribution within each
cell be sufficiently isotropic, as measured by its moment of inertia tensor. In
this way, collapse is only refined if it occurs along all three axes, ensuring
that the softening $\epsilon$ is always of order twice the largest
inter-particle spacing in a cell. This more conservative force softening
criterion is designed to minimise spurious two-body effects, while maintaining
high force resolution in collapsed regions of the flow. We test NovA using an
antisymmetric perturbed plane wave collapse (`Valinia' test) before applying it
to warm dark matter (WDM) simulations. For the Valinia test, we show that --
unlike the standard $N$-body method -- NovA produces no numerical fragmentation
while still being able to correctly capture fine caustics and shells around the
collapsing regions. For the WDM simulations, we find that NovA converges
significantly more rapidly than standard $N$-body, producing little or no
spurious halos on small scales. We show, however, that determining whether or
not halos exist below the free streaming mass $M_{\rm fs}$ is complicated by
the fact that our halo finder (AHF) likely incorrectly labels some caustics and
criss-crossing filaments as halos, while one or two particularly massive
filaments appear to fragment in any version of NovA where refinement is
allowed. Such massive filaments may be physically unstable to collapse, as is
the case for infinite, static, self-gravitating cylinders. We will use NovA in
forthcoming papers to study the issue of halo formation below $M_{\rm fs}$;
filament stability; and to obtain new constraints on the temperature of dark
matter.

via elastic distortions interspersed with intermittent bursts or avalanches of
plastic motion. In these avalanches, the colloids rearrange to minimize their
colloid-colloid repulsive interaction energy by adopting an average lattice
constant that is isotropic despite the anisotropic nature of the compression.
The avalanches take the form of shear banding events that decrease or increase
the structural order of the system. At larger compressions, the avalanches are
associated with a reduction of the number of rows of colloids that fit within
the confining potential, and between avalanches the colloids can exhibit
partially crystalline or even smectic ordering. The colloid velocity
distributions during the avalanches have a non-Gaussian form with power law
tails and exponents that are consistent with those found for the velocity

scatter in the [S/Fe] ratio in this metallicity span, which is inconsistent
with canonical chemical evolution models. To date, very few measurements of
[S/Fe] exist for stars in GCs, which are good tracers of the chemical
enrichment of their environment. However, some light and alpha elements show
star-to-star variations within individual GCs and it is yet unclear whether
sulphur also varies between GC stars. We used the the infrared spectrograph
CRIRES to obtain high-resolution (R~50000), high signal-to-noise (SNR~200 per
px) spectra in the region of the S I multiplet 3 at 1045 nm for 15 GC stars
selected from the literature (6 stars in M4, 6 stars in M22 and 3 stars in
M30). Multiplet 3 is better suited for S abundance derivation than the more
commonly used lines of multiplet 1 at 920 nm, since its lines are not blended
by telluric absorption or other stellar features at low metallicity. We used
spectral synthesis to derive the [S/Fe] ratio of the stars assuming local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We find mean [S/Fe] = 0.58 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.20
dex (statistical and systematic error) for M4, [S/Fe] = 0.57+/-0.01+/-0.19 dex
for M22, and [S/Fe] = 0.55+/-0.02+/-0.16 dex for M30. The negative NLTE
corrections are estimated to be in the order of the systematic uncertainties.
With the tentative exception of two stars with measured high S abundances, we
conclude that sulphur behaves like a typical alpha element in the studied
Galactic GCs, showing enhanced abundances with respect to the solar value at
metallicities below [Fe/H] = -1.0 dex without a considerable spread.

$\Lambda_{\rm MSR}$ method; the local surface density $\Sigma_{\rm LDR}$
method; and the $\Omega_{\rm GSR}$ technique, which isolates groups of stars
and determines whether the most massive star in each group is more centrally
concentrated than the average star. All four methods have been proposed in the
literature as techniques for quantifying mass segregation, yet they routinely
produce contradictory results as they do not all measure the same thing. We
apply each method to synthetic star-forming regions to determine when and why
they have shortcomings. When a star-forming region is smooth and centrally
concentrated, all four methods correctly identify mass segregation when it is
present. However, if the region is spatially substructured, the $\Omega_{\rm
GSR}$ method fails because it arbitrarily defines groups in the hierarchical
distribution, and usually discards positional information for many of the most
massive stars in the region. We also show that the $\Lambda_{\rm MSR}$ and
$\Sigma_{\rm LDR}$ methods can sometimes produce apparently contradictory
results, because they use different definitions of mass segregation. We
conclude that only $\Lambda_{\rm MSR}$ measures mass segregation in the
classical sense (without the need for defining the centre of the region),

dynamical evolution in a star-forming region.

parameters $V_{cb}$, $V_{ub}$ and $\gamma$. We show this dependence with the
help of analytic expressions as well as accurate interpolating formulae.
Unfortunately a clarification of the discrepancies between inclusive and
exclusive determinations of $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ from tree-level decays will
likely require results from the Belle II experiment available at the end of
this decade. Thus we investigate whether higher precision on both branching
ratios is achievable by determining $V_{cb}$, $V_{ub}$ and $\gamma$ by means of
other observables that are already precisely measured. In this context
$\varepsilon_K$ and $\Delta M_{s,d}$, together with the expected progress in
QCD lattice calculations will play a prominent role. We find
$\mathcal{B}(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu) = (9.11\pm 0.72) \times 10^{-11}$ and
$\mathcal{B}(K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu) = (3.00\pm 0.30) \times 10^{-11}$, which is
more precise than using averages of the present tree-level values of $V_{cb}$,
$V_{ub}$ and $\gamma$. Furthermore, we point out the correlation between
$\mathcal{B}(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$,
$\overline{\mathcal{B}}(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ and $\gamma$ within the SM, that is
only very weakly dependent on other CKM parameters. Finally, we also update the
ratio $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ in the SM and present its correlation with
$K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$.

test whether protostellar infall can trigger Rossby wave instability (RWI) in
protoplanetry disks. Our results show that infall can trigger the RWI and
generate vortices near the outer edge of the mass landing on the disk (i.e.
centrifugal radius). We find that the RWI is triggered under a variety of
conditions, although the details depend on the disk parameters and the infall
pattern. The common key feature of triggering the RWI is the steep radial
gradient of the azimuthal velocity induced by the local increase in density at
the outer edge of the infall region. Vortices form when the instability enters
the nonlinear regime. In our standard model where self-gravity is neglected,
vortices merge together to a single vortex within $\sim 20$ local orbital
times, and the merged vortex survives for the remaining duration of the
calculation ($> 170$ local orbital times). The vortex takes part in outward
angular momentum transport, with a Reynolds stress of $\lesssim10^{-2}$. Our
two-fluid calculations show that vortices efficiently trap dust particles with
stopping times of the order of the orbital time, locally enhancing the dust to
gas ratio for particles of the appropriate size by a factor of $\sim 40$ in our
standard model. When self-gravity is considered, however, vortices tend to be
impeded from merging and may eventually dissipate. We conclude it may well have
that protoplanetary disks have favorable conditions for vortex formation during
the protostellar infall phase, which might enhance early planetary core
formation.

flares as energetic as observed from several M4V stars using both Kepler and

times less likely to produce a flare of a comparable energy to the more active

new higher bar-cobar adjunction with the category of operads, and a new higher

properties. For instance, the higher bar-cobar construction provides us with a
cofibrant replacement functor for operads over any ring. All these
constructions are produced conceptually by applying the curved Koszul duality

studies enabled by the multiwavelength campaigns carried out during the recent

from Mrk 501 could be due to a complex superposition of multiple emission
zones. Moreover new evidences of detection of very hard intrinsic $\gamma$-ray

on the orbital period of 16.58 days, the rebinned lightcurve peaks in phase
with the observed X-ray and high-energy phaseograms. The fit of the H.E.S.S.

These phonon modes correspond to the waterwheel modes determined from

estimates are invariant across changes to the model structure. When a single

important in the chromosphere and not deeply studied until recently: the
ion-neutral interaction effects (INIE) in the chromosphere. We review the
relevance and the role of the partial ionization in the chromosphere and show
that this process actually impacts considerably the outer solar atmosphere. We
include analysis of our 2.5D radiative MHD simulations with the Bifrost code

chromosphere and corona and thermal conduction along magnetic field lines. The
photosphere, chromosphere and transition region are partially ionized and the
interaction between ionized particles and neutral particles has important
consequences on the magneto-thermodynamics of these layers. The INIE are
treated using generalized Ohm's law, i.e., we consider the Hall term and the
ambipolar diffusion in the induction equation. The interaction between the
different species affects the modeled atmosphere as follows: 1) the ambipolar
diffusion dissipates magnetic energy and increases the minimum temperature in
the chromosphere; 2) the upper chromosphere may get heated and expanded over a
greater range of heights. These processes reveal appreciable differences
between the modeled atmospheres of simulations with and without INIE.

(e.g. their mass, spin angular momentum and quadrupole moment) are interrelated
in a way that is approximately insensitive to their internal structure. Such
approximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data
analysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although
the pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain
scenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase
transitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the
approximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future
observations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and
tidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third
order in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only
weakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to
the isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in
explaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity
variation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the
emergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not
affect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in
gravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity. We provide an
explicit example of the latter in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. The increase
in variability of the universal relations due to pressure anisotropy could
affect their use in future X-ray observations. Given expected observational
uncertainties, however, the relations remain sufficiently universal for use in
such observations if the anisotropic modifications to the moment of inertia and
the quadrupole moment are less than 10% of their isotropic values.

fabrication of superconducting RF cavities, displays micron-sized surface
patches containing excess carbon. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy measurements are presented
which reveal the presence of nanoscale NbC coherent precipitates in such
regions. Raman backscatter spectroscopy on similar surface regions exhibit
spectra consistent with the literature results on bulk NbC but with
significantly enhanced two-phonon scattering. The unprecedented strength and
sharpness of the two-phonon signal has prompted a theoretical analysis, using
density functional theory (DFT), of phonon modes in NbC for two different
interface models of the coherent precipitate. One model leads to overall
compressive strain and a comparison to ab-initio calculations of phonon
dispersion curves under uniform compression of the NbC shows that the measured
two-phonon peaks are linked directly to phonon anomalies arising from strong
electron-phonon interaction. Another model of the extended interface between Nb
and NbC, studied by DFT, gives insight into the frequency shifts of the
acoustic and optical mode density of states measured by first order Raman. The
exact origin of the stronger two-phonon response is not known at present but it
suggests the possibility of enhanced electron-phonon coupling in transition
metal carbides under strain found either in the bulk NbC inclusions or at their
interfaces with Nb metal. Preliminary tunneling studies using a point contact
method show some energy gaps larger than expected for bulk NbC.

goal is to find the optimal placement (configuration) of instances to minimize
the average cost over time, leveraging the ability of predicting future cost
parameters with known accuracy. We first propose an offline algorithm that
solves for the optimal configuration in a specific look-ahead time-window.
Then, we propose an online approximation algorithm with polynomial
time-complexity to find the placement in real-time whenever an instance
arrives. We analytically show that the online algorithm is $O(1)$-competitive
for a broad family of cost functions. Afterwards, the impact of prediction
errors is considered and a method for finding the optimal look-ahead window
size is proposed, which minimizes an upper bound of the average actual cost.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulations with
both synthetic and real-world (San Francisco taxi) user-mobility traces. The
theoretical methodology used in this paper can potentially be applied to a
larger class of dynamic resource allocation problems.

Galactic centre. We follow the gas from its origin as stellar winds of several
observed young massive stars, until it is either captured by the central black
hole, or leaves the system. Unlike our previous models, we include an outflow
from the inner accretion flow. Two different kinds of outflows are modelled:
(i) an instantaneous-response feedback mode, in which the outflow rate is
directly proportional to the current black hole gas capture rate; and (ii) an
outburst mode, which is stronger but lasts for a limited time. The latter
situation may be particularly relevant to Sgr A*, since there is evidence that
Sgr A* was much brighter in the recent past. We find that both types of outflow
perturb the gas dynamics near the Bondi radius and the black hole capture rate
significantly. The effects persist longer than the outflow itself. We also
compare the effects of spherically symmetric and collimated outflows, and find
that the latter are far less efficient in transferring its energy to the
surrounding gas near the capture radius. Our results imply that accretion
feedback is important for non-radiative accretion flows not only within but
also outside the capture radius. Steady-state Bondi accretion rate estimates
that do not account for feedback outflows over-predict not only the accretion
rate onto the black hole but also the capture rate at the Bondi radius itself.
Finally, the steady-state assumption under which non-radiative flows have been
routinely studied in the literature may have to be abandoned if accretion
feedback is bursty in nature.

microblogs gain their popularity. This model explicitly captures the triggering
effect of each forwarding, distinguishing itself from the reinforced Poisson
process based model where all previous forwardings are simply aggregated as a
single triggering effect. We validate the proposed model by applying it on Sina
Weibo, the most popular microblogging network in China. Experimental results
demonstrate that the SEHP model consistently outperforms the model based on
reinforced Poisson process.

radial density, temperature, entropy and metallicity profiles, as well as other
morphological measurements. The entropy profiles are computed to larger radial
extents than in previous Chandra cluster sample analyses. We find that the iron
mass fraction measured in the inner 0.15 R500 shows a larger dispersion across
the sample of low-mass clusters, than it does for the sample of high-mass
clusters. We interpret this finding as the result of the mixing of more haloes
in large clusters than in small clusters, which leads to an averaging of the
metal content in the large clusters, and thus less dispersion of metallicity
for high-mass clusters. This interpretation lends support to the idea that the
low-entropy, metal-rich gas of merging haloes reaches clusters' centers, which
explains observations of Core-Collapse Supernova products metallicity peaks,
and which is seen in hydrodynamical simulations. The gas in these merging
haloes would have to reach the centers of clusters without mixing in the outer
regions, in order to support our interpretation. On the other hand, metallicity
dispersion does not change with mass in the outer regions of clusters,
suggesting that most of the outer metals come from a source with a more uniform
metallicity level, such as during pre-enrichment. We also measure a correlation
between the metal content in low-mass clusters and the degree to which their
Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) is morphologically disturbed, as measured by
centroid shift. This suggests an alternative interpretation of the large width
of the metallicity distribution in low-mass clusters, whereby a metallicity
boost in the center of low-mass clusters is induced as a transitional state,
during mergers.

different cuprates. It remains puzzling up to now in spite of intensive

physics at work in gamma-ray bursts. This can only be done for GRBs with known
redshift. Since redshifts are usually measured from the optical spectrum of the
afterglow, correlations between prompt and afterglow emissions may introduce
biases in the distribution of rest-frame properties of the prompt emission,
especially considering that we measure the redshift of only one third of Swift
GRBs.
  In this paper we study the brightness of optical GRB afterglows and the role
of optical selection effects in the distribution of various intrinsic
properties of GRBs and on the Epi - Eiso relation discovered by Amati et al.
(2002). Our analysis is based on a sample of 85 GRBs with good optical
follow-up and well measured prompt emission. 71 of them have a measure of
redshift and 14 have no redshift. We discuss the connection between the
location of GRBs in the Epi-Eiso plane and their optical brightness measured
two hours after the trigger in the GRB rest frame. We show that the brightness
of GRBs in our sample is mainly driven by their intrinsic luminosity and
depends only slightly on their redshift. We also show that GRBs with faint
afterglows are preferentially located in the upper part of the Epi-Eiso plane.
This optical selection effect favors the detection of GRBs with bright
afterglows located below the best fit Epi - Eiso relation whose redshift is
easily measurable.
  We conclude that the distributions of prompt GRB properties in the rest frame
undergo selection effects due to the need to measure the redshift from the
optical afterglow emission. These biases put significant uncertanties when
interpreting the statistical studies of GRB properties in the rest frame. We
show that the Epi - Eiso relation is not immune to these selection effects.

classify and segment the observations on-the-fly, without being limited to a
rigid number of classes. In addition, the model needs to be capable of updating
its parameters to comply with possible evolutions. This interesting problem,
however, is not adequately addressed in the literature since many studies focus
on offline classification over a pre-defined class set. In this paper, we
propose a principled solution to this gap by introducing an adaptive online
system based on Markov switching models with hierarchical Dirichlet process

classifying the sequential data over unlimited number of classes, while meeting
the memory and delay constraints of streaming contexts. The model is further
enhanced by introducing a learning rate, responsible for balancing the extent
to which the model sustains its previous learning (parameters) or adapts to the
new streaming observations. Experimental results on several variants of

heterojunctions have shown promise for low energy logic but presently do not
display subthreshold swings steeper than the room-temperature thermal limit of
60 mV/decade. These devices also show a pronounced temperature dependence that
is not characteristic of a tunneling process. Herein, we explore these aspects
by studying the temperature dependence of two-terminal InAs/GaSb
heterojunctions, allowing for the true nature of tunneling at the interface to
be seen without convolution from other three-terminal parasitic effects such as
gate oxide traps. We compare the temperature dependence of peak current, excess
current, and conductance slope for InAs/GaSb interfaces with and without
interface defects. We identify that the tunnel and excess currents depend on
temperature and defect density and propose that the ultimate leakage current in
TFETs based on these materials will be affected by defects and inhomogeneity at
the interface. We determine that the conductance slope, a two-terminal analog
to subthreshold slope, does not depend on temperature, contrasting sharply with
the heavy temperature dependence seen in three terminal devices in literature.
We propose that TFETs based on this and similar materials systems are dominated
by parasitic effects such as tunneling into oxide trap states, or other
parasitics that are not intrinsic to the heterojunction itself, and that in the
absence of these effects, the true steepness from band-to-band tunneling is
limited by defects and inhomogeneity at the interface.

and geological timescales. An important open question is whether this is a
result of evolutionary optimization or a universal feature of life. In the
latter case, the origin of life would be coincident with a shift in
environmental conditions. Here we present a model for the emergence of life in
which replicators are explicitly coupled to their environment through the
recycling of a finite supply of resources. The model exhibits a dynamic,
first-order phase transition from non-life to ""life,"" where the life phase is
distinguished by selection on replicators. We show that environmental coupling
plays an important role in the dynamics of the transition. The transition
corresponds to a redistribution of matter in replicators and their environment,
driven by selection on replicators, exhibiting an explosive growth in diversity
as replicators are selected. The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual
information shared between replicators and their environment. In the absence of
successfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete,
leading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges.
Often, the replicators that initiate the transition are not those that are
ultimately selected. The results are consistent with the view that life's
propensity to shape its environment is indeed a universal feature of
replicators, characteristic of the transition from non-life to life. We discuss
the implications of these results for understanding life's emergence and
evolutionary transitions more broadly.

relaxation of the classical problem of constructing error-correcting codes,
which corresponds to $\alpha=0$. Existence of an $(\alpha,\beta)$-map is
equivalent to existence of a graph homomorphism $\bar H(k,\alpha k)\to \bar

graph-homomorphism based on the semi-definite relaxation of the independence

is then evaluated using some known and some new results from coding theory

provides both a dynamic model of research as well as a formal framework for

the same factors that make initial findings unreliable also make replications
unreliable. The most important factors in improving the reliability of research
are the rate of false positives and the base rate of true hypotheses, and we
offer suggestions for addressing each. Our results also bring clarity to verbal
debates about the communication of research. Surprisingly, publication bias is
not always an obstacle, but instead may have positive impacts---suppression of
negative novel findings is often beneficial. We also find that communication of
negative replications may aid true discovery even when attempts to replicate
have diminished power. The model speaks constructively to ongoing debates about

matrices in a combinatorial framework: for any parameter N, we introduce a
family of linear forms on the partition algebras which allows us to define a
notion of weak convergence similar to the convergence in moments in random
matrices theory. A renormalization of the partition algebras allows us to
consider the weak convergence as a simple convergence in a fixed space. This
leads us to the definition of a deformed partition algebra for any integer
parameter N and to the definition of two transforms: the cumulants transform
and the exclusive moments transform. Using an improved triangular inequality
for the distance defined on partitions, we prove that the deformed partition
algebras, endowed with a deformation of the linear forms converge as N go to
infinity. This result allows us to prove combinatorial properties about
geodesics and a convergence theorem for semi-groups of functions on partitions.

finite support : a new addition operation and a notion of R-transform are
defined. We introduce the set of multiplicative functions which becomes a Lie
group for the new addition and multiplication operations. For each of them, the
Lie algebra is studied. The appropriate tools are developed in order to
understand the algebraic fluctuations of the moments and cumulants for
converging sequences. This allows us to extend all the results we got for the

given managed region: from implementing a uniform approach across the region to
considering a unique approach in each of one hundred patches and everything in
between. Spatially explicit approaches, such as the implementation of marine
spatial planning and marine reserves, are increasingly used in fishery
management. Using a spatially explicit bioeconomic model, we quantify how the
management scale affects optimal fishery profit, biomass, fishery effort, and
the fraction of habitat in marine reserves. We find that, if habitats are
randomly distributed, the fishery profit increases almost linearly with the
number of segments. However, if habitats are positively autocorrelated, then
the fishery profit increases with diminishing returns. Therefore, the true
optimum in management scale given cost to subdivision depends on the habitat

Comparing with the results for quark matter with the rainbow approximation, the

space of all probability distributions compatible with these $M$ expectation
values within some fixed accuracy, called version space, is studied. We
introduce a biased measure over the version space, which gives a boost
increasing exponentially with the entropy of the distributions and with an
arbitrary inverse `temperature' $\Gamma$. The choice of $\Gamma$ allows us to
interpolate smoothly between the unbiased measure over all distributions in the
version space ($\Gamma=0$) and the pointwise measure concentrated at the
maximum entropy distribution ($\Gamma \to \infty$). Using the replica method we
compute the volume of the version space and other quantities of interest, such
as the distance $R$ between the target distribution and the center-of-mass
distribution over the version space, as functions of $\alpha=(\log M)/N$ and
$\Gamma$ for large $N$. Phase transitions at critical values of $\alpha$ are
found, corresponding to qualitative improvements in the learning of the target

$\alpha$, the distance $R$ does not vary with $\Gamma$, which means that the
maximum entropy distribution is not closer to the target distribution than any
other distribution compatible with the observable values. Our results are

beamforming in a multi-antenna wireless-powered communication network (WPCN).
The considered network consists of one hybrid access-point (AP) with multiple
antennas and a single antenna user. The user does not have constant power
supply and thus needs to harvest energy from the signals broadcast by the AP in
the downlink (DL), before sending its data back to the AP with the harvested
energy in the uplink (UL). We derive closed-form expressions of the average
throughput and their asymptotic expressions at high SNR for both delay-limited
and delay-tolerant transmission modes. The optimal DL energy harvesting time,
which maximizes the system throughput, is then obtained for high SNR. All
analytical expressions are validated by numerical simulations. The impact of
various parameters, such as the AP transmit power, the energy harvesting time,
and the number of antennas, on the system throughput is also investigated.

response of a bilayer membrane to the application of a negative (compressive)
mechanical tension. Such a tension destabilizes the long wavelength undulation
modes of giant vesicles, but it can be sustained when small membranes and
vesicles are considered. Our negative tension simulation results reveal two
regimes - (i) a weak negative tension regime characterized by
stretching-dominated elasticity, and (ii) a strong negative tension regime
featuring bending-dominated elastic behavior. This resembles the findings of
the classic Evans and Rawicz micropipette aspiration experiment in giant
unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) [Phys, Rev. Lett. {\bf 64}, 2094 (1990)]. However,
while in GUVs the crossover between the two elasticity regimes occurs at a
small positive surface tension, in smaller membranes it takes place at a
moderate negative tension. Another interesting observation concerning the
response of a small membrane to negative surface tension is related to the
relationship between the mechanical and fluctuation tensions, which are equal
to each other for non-negative values. When the tension decreases to negative
values, the fluctuation tension $\gamma$ drops somewhat faster than $\tau$ in
the small negative tension regime, before it saturates (and becomes larger than
$\tau$) for large negative tensions. The bending modulus exhibit an ""opposite""
trend. It remains almost unchanged in the stretching-dominated elastic regime,
and decreases in the bending-dominated regime. Both the amplitudes of the
thermal height undulations and the projected area variations diverge at the

average system throughput under different fairness requirements, such as
proportional fairness and equal throughput fairness. In particular, the
algorithm designs are formulated as non-convex optimization problems which take
into account the minimum required average sum harvested energy in the system.
The problems are solved by using convex optimization techniques and the
proposed optimization framework reveals the tradeoff between the long-term
average system throughput and the sum harvested energy in multiuser systems
with fairness constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that substantial
performance gains can be achieved by the proposed optimization framework

formulated as a non-convex optimization problem which maximizes the achievable
rate subject to a minimum required average power transfer. Subsequently, the
non-convex optimization problem is reformulated by big-M method which can be
solved optimally. Furthermore, we show that joint power allocation and user

contributions as follows. It presents a generic analytical framework for
obtaining the Average Bit Error Probability (ABEP) of uncoded OSM with coherent
detection in the presence of turbulence-induced fading.
  Although the framework is general enough to accommodate any type of models
based on turbulence scattering, the focus in this paper is the H-K
distribution. Although this distribution represents a very general scattering
model valid over a wide range of atmospheric conditions, it is has not been
considered in the past in conjunction with FSO systems possibly because of its
mathematical complexity. The proposed analytical framework yields exact
performance evaluation results for MIMO systems with two transmit- and an
arbitrary number of receive apertures. In addition, tight upper bounds are
derived for the error probability for OSM systems with an arbitrary number of
transmit apertures as well as for convolutionally encoded signals. The
performance of OSM is compared to that of well established coherent FSO
schemes, employing spatial diversity at the transmitter or the receiver only.
Specifically, it is shown that OSM can offer comparable performance with
conventional coherent FSO schemes while outperforming the latter in terms of
spectral efficiency and hardware complexity. Various numerical performance
evaluation results are also presented and compared with equivalent results
obtained by Monte Carlo simulations which verify the accuracy of the derived

guarantee that the Solar-System constraints are preserved and moreover we
extract bounds on the transition time and the free parameters of the scenario.
We find that the transition redshifts predicted by $f(T)$ cosmology, although

content recommendation and Internet advertising. A central task is evaluation
of a new policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and
received rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically does not
faithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new policy. Previous
approaches rely either on models of rewards or models of the past policy. The
former are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter have a large variance. In
this work, we leverage the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of the two
approaches by applying the doubly robust estimation technique to the problems
of policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this approach yields
accurate value estimates when we have either a good (but not necessarily
consistent) model of rewards or a good (but not necessarily consistent) model
of past policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the doubly
robust estimation uniformly improves over existing techniques, achieving both
lower variance in value estimation and better policies. As such, we expect the
doubly robust approach to become common practice in policy evaluation and
optimization.

integers $\tau(e)$ and $c(e)$ represent, for each edge $e\in E$, the time
required to traverse edge $e$ and its nonnegative capacity, and the set
$S\subseteq V$ is a set of sources. In the $k$-{\sc Sink Location} problem, one
is given as input a dynamic network ${\cal N}$ where every source $u\in S$ is
given a nonnegative supply value $\sigma(u)$. The task is then to find a set of
sinks $X = \{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}$ in $G$ that minimizes the routing time of all
supply to $X$. Note that, in the case where $G$ is an undirected graph, the
optimal position of the sinks in $X$ needs not be at vertices, and can be
located along edges. Hoppe and Tardos showed that, given an instance of
$k$-{\sc Sink Location} and a set of $k$ vertices $X\subseteq V$, one can find
an optimal routing scheme of all the supply in $G$ to $X$ in polynomial time,
in the case where graph $G$ is directed. Note that when $G$ is directed, this
suffices to obtain polynomial-time solvability of the $k$-{\sc Sink Location}
problem, since any optimal position will be located at vertices of $G$.
However, the computational complexity of the $k$-{\sc Sink Location} problem on
general undirected graphs is still open. In this paper, we show that the
$k$-{\sc Sink Location} problem admits a fully polynomial-time approximation
scheme (FPTAS) for every fixed $k$, and that the problem is $W[1]$-hard when
parameterized by $k$.

Full flux loop signals provide a global measurement proportional to the voltage
induced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux; they are electromagnetically
induced by the dynamics of spatially integrated current density. We perform
direct time-domain analysis of the high time-resolution full flux loop signals
VLD2 and VLD3. We analyze plasmas where a steady H-mode is sustained over
several seconds, during which all the observed ELMs are intrinsic; there is no
deliberate intent to pace the ELMing process by external means. ELM occurrence
times are determined from the Be II emission at the divertor. We previously
found that the occurrence times of intrinsic ELMs correlate with specific
phases of the VLD2 and VLD3 signals. Here, we investigate how the VLD2 and VLD3
phases vary with time in advance of the ELM occurrence time. We identify a
build-up to the ELM in which the VLD2 and VLD3 signals progressively align to
the phase at which ELMs preferentially occur, on a ~ 2 -5ms timescale. At the
same time, the VLD2 and VLD3 signals become phase synchronized with each other,
consistent with the emergence of coherent global dynamics in the integrated
current density. In a plasma that remains close to a global magnetic
equilibrium, this can reflect bulk displacement or motion of the plasma. This
build-up signature to an intrinsic ELM can be extracted from a time interval of
data that does not extend beyond the ELM occurrence time, so that these full

the ""reentrant condensation"" and the charge inversion of
polyelectrolyte-decorated liposomes by means of dynamic light scattering and
electrophoresis. We explored the stability of this model
polyelectrolyte/colloid system by fixing each time the charge of the bare
liposomes and by changing two independent control parameters of the
suspensions: the polyelectrolyte/colloid charge ratio and the ionic strength of
the aqueous suspending medium. The progressive addition of neutral DOPC lipid
within the liposome membrane gave rise to a new intriguing phenomenon: the
stability diagram of the suspensions showed a novel reentrance due to the
crossing of the desorption threshold of the polyelectrolyte. Indeed, at fixed
charge density of the bare DOTAP/DOPC liposomes and for a wide range of polyion
concentrations, we showed that the simple electrolyte addition first (low salt
regime) destabilizes the suspensions because of the enhanced screening of the
residual repulsion between the complexes, and then (high salt regime)
determines the onset of a new stable phase, originated by the absence of
polyelectrolyte adsorption on the particle surfaces. We show that the observed
phenomenology can be rationalized within the Velegol-Thwar model for
heterogeneously charged particles and that the polyelectrolyte desorption fits
well the predictions of the adsorption theory of Winkler and Cherstvy. Our
findings unambiguously support the picture of the reentrant condensation as
driven by the correlated adsorption of the polyelectrolyte chains on the
particle surface, providing interesting insights into possible mechanisms for
tailoring complex colloids via salt-induced effects.

anisotropy in the residual resistivity component increases in proportional to
the Ru dopant concentration, as in the case of Co-doped compounds. On the other
hand, both the residual resistivity and the resistivity anisotropy induced by
isovalent Ru substitution is found to be one order of magnitude smaller than
those induced by heterovalent Co substitution. Combined with angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy results, which show almost the same anisotropic band
structure both for the parent and Ru-substituted compounds, we confirm the
scenario that the anisotropy in the residual resistivity arises from
anisotropic impurity scattering in the magneto-structurally ordered phase
rather than directly from the anisotropic band structure of that phase.

multidimensional measurements in parts. PUKF evaluates the nonlinearity of the
measurement function within a Gaussian prior by comparing the effect of the 2nd
order term on the Gaussian measurement noise. A linear transformation is
applied to measurements to minimize the nonlinearity of a part of the
measurement. The measurement update is then applied using only the part of the
measurement that has low nonlinearity and the process is then repeated for the
updated state using the remaining part of the transformed measurement until the
whole measurement has been used. PUKF does the linearizations numerically and
no analytical differentiation is required. Results show that when the
measurement geometry allows effective partitioning, the proposed algorithm
improves estimation accuracy and produces accurate covariance estimates.

inter-atomic exchange parameters ($J_{ij}$) of strongly correlated systems,
based on first-principles full-potential electronic structure theory. The
electronic structure is modelled with the help of a full-potential linear
muffin-tin orbital method. The effects of strong electron correlations are
considered within the charge self-consistent density functional theory plus
dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT). The exchange parameters are then
extracted using the magnetic force theorem, hence all the calculations are
performed within a single computational framework. The method allows to
investigate how the $J_{ij}$-parameters are affected by dynamical electron
correlations. In addition to describing the formalism and details of the
implementation, we also present magnetic properties of a few commonly discussed
systems, characterised by different degrees of electron localisation. In bcc Fe
we found a minor renormalisation of the $J_{ij}$ interactions once the
dynamical correlations are introduced. However, generally, if the magnetic
coupling has several competing contributions from different orbitals, the
redistribution of the spectral weight and changes in the exchange splitting of
these states can lead to a dramatic modification of the total interaction
parameter. In NiO we found that both static and dynamical mean-field results
provide an adequate description of the exchange interactions, which is somewhat
surprising given the fact that these two methods result in quite different
electronic structures. By employing Hubbard-I approximation for the treatment
of the $4f$ states in hcp Gd we reproduce the experimentally observed multiplet
structure. The calculated exchange parameters result to be rather close to the
ones obtained by treating the $4f$ electrons as non-interacting core states.

study the impact of size polydispersity on the basic nature of Lennard-Jones

via two- and three-dimensional molecular dynamics computer simulations. A
single-component liquid constituting spherical particles and interacting via
the LJ potential is known to exhibit strong correlations between virial and
potential energy equilibrium fluctuations at constant volume. This correlation
significantly simplifies the physical description of the liquid, and these
liquids are now known as Roskilde-simple (RS) liquids. We show that this simple
nature of the single-component LJ liquid is preserved even for very high
polydispersities (above 40% polydispersity for the studied uniform
distribution). We also investigate isomorphs of moderately polydisperse LJ
liquids. Isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram of RS liquids along which
structure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic quantities are invariant in
dimensionless units. We find that isomorphs are a good approximation even for
polydisperse LJ liquids. The theory of isomorphs thus extends readily to
multi-component systems and can be used to improve even further the
understanding of these intriguing systems.

extragalactic point sources, e.g. QSOs, is feasible with the ongoing Gaia
mission. Such a selection would be interesting as it would be unbiased in terms
of colours of the targets and hence would allow selection also with colours in
the stellar sequence. We have analyzed a total of 18 representative regions of
the sky by using GUMS, the simulator prepared for ESAs Gaia mission, both in
the range of $12\le G \le 20$ mag and $12\le G \le 18$ mag. For each region we
determine the density of apparently stationary stellar sources, i.e. sources
for which Gaia cannot measure a significant proper motion. The density is
contrasted with the density of extragalactic point sources, e.g. QSOs, in order
to establish in which celestial directions a pure astrometric selection is
feasible. When targeting regions at galactic latitude $|b| \ge 30^\mathrm{o}$
the ratio of QSOs to apparently stationary stars is above 50\% and when
observing towards the poles the fraction of QSOs goes up to about $\sim80$\%.
We show that the proper motions from the proposed Gaia successor mission in
about 20 years would dramatically improve these results at all latitudes.
Detection of QSOs solely from zero proper motion, unbiased by any assumptions
on spectra, might lead to the discovery of new types of QSOs or new classes of
extragalactic point sources.

localization, geographic routing, and vehicular networks. Unfortunately,
typical positioning techniques based on ranging or on velocity and angular
measurements are inherently limited. To overcome the limitations of specific
positioning techniques, the fusion of multiple and heterogeneous sensor
information is an appealing strategy. In this paper, we investigate the
fundamental performance of linear fusion of multiple measurements of the
position of mobile nodes, and propose a new distributed recursive position
estimator. The Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for the parametric and a-posteriori
cases are investigated. The proposed estimator combines information coming from
ranging, speed, and angular measurements, which is jointly fused by a Pareto
optimization problem where the mean and the variance of the localization error
are simultaneously minimized. A distinguished feature of the method is that it
assumes a very simple dynamical model of the mobility and therefore it is
applicable to a large number of scenarios providing good performance. The main
challenge is the characterization of the statistical information needed to
model the Fisher information matrix and the Pareto optimization problem. The
proposed analysis is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, and the performance
is compared to several Kalman-based filters, commonly employed for localization
and sensor fusion. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator
outperforms the traditional approaches that are based on the extended Kalman
filter when no assumption on the model of motion is used. In such a scenario,
better performance is achieved by the proposed method, but at the price of an
increased computational complexity.

capable of bringing gas molecules to extremely fast rotation in a very short
time, while keeping their translational motion intact and relatively slow. We
investigate collisional equilibration dynamics of this new state of molecular
gases, and find that it follows a remarkable generic scenario. The route to
equilibrium starts with a durable metastable 'gyroscopic stage', in the course
of which the molecules maintain their fast rotation and orientation of the
angular momentum through many collisions. The inhibited
rotational-translational relaxation is characterized by a persistent anisotropy
in the molecular angular distribution, and is manifested in the long-lasting
optical birefringence, and anisotropic diffusion in the gas. After a certain
induction time, the 'gyroscopic stage' is abruptly terminated by a
self-accelerating explosive rotational-translational energy exchange leading
the gas towards the final thermal equilibrium. We illustrate our conclusions by
direct Molecular Dynamics simulation of super-rotors in several gases
consisting of common linear molecules (such as N_2, O_2 and CO_2).

optical broad emission lines and a X-ray Fe-K line, which are typical for
Seyfert galaxies. In our precious studies of NGC 1275 with Suzaku/XIS, no X-ray
time variability was found from 2006 to 2011, regardless of moderate gamma-ray
variability observed by {it Fermi}-LAT~\cite{Yamazaki}. We have continued
monitoring observations of NGC 1275 with Suzaku/XIS. In 2013-2014, MeV/GeV
gams-ray flux of NGC 1275 gradually increased and reached the maximum at the
beginning of 2014. Correlated with this recent gamma-ray activity, we found
that X-ray flux also increased, and this is the first evidence of X-ray
variability of NGC 1275. Following these results, we discuss the emission
component during the time variability, but we cannot decide the origin of X-ray
variability correlating with gamma-ray. Therefore, for future observation, it
is important to observe NGC 1275 by using Fermi gamma-ray, XMM-Newton, NuStar,

that the signal of interest is of $2N-1$ dimensional and $R<<2N-1$. This
framework covers a large class of signals arising from real applications in
biology, automation, imaging science, etc. To reconstruct such a signal, our
algorithm is to seek a low-rank Hankel matrix of the signal by minimizing its
nuclear norm subject to the consistency on the sampled data. Our theoretical
results show that a robust recovery is possible as long as the number of
projections exceeds $O(R\ln^2N)$. No incoherence or separation condition is
required in our proof. Our method can be applied to spectral compressed sensing
where the signal of interest is a superposition of $R$ complex sinusoids.
Compared to existing results, our result here does not need any separation
condition on the frequencies, while achieving better or comparable bounds on
the number of measurements. Furthermore, our method provides theoretical
guidance on how many samples are required in the state-of-the-art non-uniform

making the UV and IR limits applied to the integrals, an approximate expression
for HEE is obtained. In case the software cannot calculate minimal surface
integrals analytically, it offers the possibility to proceed with a numerical
evaluation of the corresponding terms. We'll understand how the area formula
incorporates the structure of the domain wall approximation. We see that HEE
changes linearly with belt angle. It's due to the extensivity of this type of
entropy and the emergent of an entropic force. We find that the wider belt
angle corresponds to a larger holographic surface. Another remarkable
observation is that no ""confinement/deconfinement"" phase transition point
exists in our $2D$ dual field theory. Furthermore we observe that the slope of

linear kernel through which stimuli are filtered before they are further
processed. If information transmission is assumed to proceed in a feedforward
cascade, the receptive field may be interpreted as the external stimulus'
profile maximizing neuronal output. The nervous system, however, contains many
feedback loops, and sensory neurons filter more currents than the ones
representing the transduced external stimulus. Some of the additional currents
are generated by the output activity of the neuron itself, and therefore
constitute feedback signals. By means of a time-frequency analysis of the
input/output transformation, here we show how feedback modifies the receptive
field. The model is applicable to various types of feedback processes, from
spike triggered intrinsic conductances to inhibitory synaptic inputs from
nearby neurons. We distinguish between the intrinsic receptive field (filtering
all input currents) and the effective receptive field (filtering only external
stimuli). Whereas the intrinsic receptive field summarizes the biophysical
properties of the neuron associated to subthreshold integration and spike
generation, only the effective receptive field can be interpreted as the
external stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. We demonstrate that
spike-triggered feedback shifts low-pass filtering towards band-pass
processing, transforming integrator neurons into resonators. For strong
feedback, a sharp resonance in the spectral neuronal selectivity may appear.
Our results provide a unified framework to interpret a collection of previous
experimental studies where specific feedback mechanisms were shown to modify
the filtering properties of neurons.

divers. Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that
the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag,
the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous
studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which
alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case
in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these
prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy
cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare
them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into
account the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion
transformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the
corresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them
with observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through
neutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the
presence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the
buoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy
cost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al.,
2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the
energy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model
confirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other
breath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for
example). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of
optimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings
(Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal
speed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can
be further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers
close to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for
the observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive
energy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a
reduction in the risk of decompression sickness.

riders would otherwise take over. It is well known that sanctioning systems,
such as the police and courts, are costly and thus can suffer from those who
free ride on other's efforts to maintain the sanctioning systems (second-order
free riders). Previous game-theory studies showed that if populations are very
large, pool punishment rarely emerges in public good games, even when
participation is optional, because of second-order free riders. Here we show
that a matching fund for rewarding cooperation leads to the emergence of pool
punishment, despite the presence of second-order free riders. We demonstrate
that reward funds can pave the way for a transition from a population of free
riders to a population of pool punishers. A key factor in promoting the
transition is also to reward those who contribute to pool punishment, yet not
abstaining from participation. Reward funds eventually vanish in raising pool
punishment, which is sustainable by punishing the second-order free riders.
This suggests that considering the interdependence of reward and punishment may
help to better understand the origins and transitions of social norms and
institutions.

oscillating phase transition which appears in a binary mixture,
PMMA/3-octanone, when this is enlightened by a strongly focused infrared laser
beam. PMMA/3-octanone has a UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) which
presents a critical point at temperature Tc = 306.6 K and volume fraction
$\phi$c = 12.8 % [Crauste et al., ArXiv 1310.6720, 2012]. This oscillatory
phenomenon appears because of thermophoretic and electrostriction effects and
non-linear diffusion. We analyze these oscillations and we propose a simple
model which includes the minimal ingredients to produce the oscillatory
behavior. Phase transitions in binary mixtures are still a widely studied
subject, specifically near the critical point where several interesting and not
completely understood phenomena may appear, among them we recall the critical
Casimir forces [2],[3], confinement effects [4], [5] and out-of-equilibrium
dynamics after a quench. The perturbation of the binary mixtures by mean of
external fields is also an important and recent field of investigation [6]. For
example, a laser can induce interesting phenomena in demixing binary mixtures
because the radiation pressure can deform the interface between the two phases
and it can be used to measure the interface tension [7]. Depending on the
nature of the binary mixtures, laser illumination can also lead to a mixing or
demixing transition. In ref.[8], focused infrared laser light heats the medium
initially in the homogeneous phase and causes a separation in the LCST (Low
Critical Solution Temperature) system. The radiation pressure gradients in a
laser beam also contribute in the aggregation of polymers , thus producing a
phase transition. The local heating may induce thermophoretic forces which
attract towards the laser beam one of the binary-mixture components [9]. Other
forces like electrostriction can also be involved [10]. In this letter, we
report a new phenomenon, which consists in an oscillating phase transition
induced by a constant illumination from an infrared laser beam in the
heterogeneous region of an UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) binary
mixture. Oscillation phenomena in phase transition have already been reported
in slow cooling UCST [11],[12] but as far as we know, never induced by a
stationary laser illumination. After describing our experimental setup , we
will present the results. Then we will use a very simplified model which
contains the main necessary physical ingredients to induce this oscillation
phenomenon.

of models and working methods for spatial crosscorrelation analysis. By analogy
with Moran's index newly expressed in a spatial quadratic form and by means of
mathematical reasoning, I derive a theoretical framework for geographical
crosscorrelation analysis. First, two sets of spatial crosscorrelation
coefficients are defined, including a global spatial crosscorrelation
coefficient and a set of local spatial crosscorrelation coefficients. Second, a
pair of scatterplots of spatial crosscorrelation is proposed, and different
scatterplots show different relationships between correlated variables. Based
on the spatial crosscorrelation coefficient, Pearson's correlation coefficient
can be decomposed into two parts: direct correlation (partial crosscorrelation)
and indirect correlation (spatial crosscorrelation). As an example, the
analytical process is applied to the relationships between China's urbanization
and economic development. Spatial crosscorrelation and spatial autocorrelation
can complement one another, and the spatial crosscorrelation scatterplots can
be used to reveal the causality inside a self-organized system. The spatial
crosscorrelation models will play a useful role in future geographical spatial
analysis.

high probability that the metallicity distribution is bimodal, with potential
peaks at -1.1 and -0.8 dex. Our data show no strong evidence of a metallicity
gradient in the SMC clusters, somewhat at odds with recent evidence from CaT
spectra of a large sample of field stars Dobbie et al. (2014). This may be
revealing possible differences in the chemical history of clusters and field

an inverse power law, which suggests a scaling process in spatial interaction.
However, the distance exponent of the model cannot be explained with the ideas
from Euclidean geometry. This results in what is called dimension dilemma. In
particular, the gravity model based on power law could not be derived from
general principles by traditional ways. Consequently, a negative exponential
function substituted for the inverse power function to serve for a
distance-decay function for the gravity model. However, the exponential-based
gravity model goes against the first law of geography. This paper is devoted to
solve these kinds of problems by mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis.
First, it can be proved that the distance exponent of the gravity model is
essentially a fractal dimension. Thus the dimensional dilemma of the
power-based gravity model can be resolved using the concepts from fractal
geometry. Second, the exponential function indicates locality and localization,
which violates the basic principle of spatial interaction. The power function
implies action at a distance, which is the necessary condition of geographical
gravitation. Third, the gravity model based on power law decay can be derived
from the entropy- maximizing principle by introducing a proper postulate. The
observational data of China's cities and regions are employed to verify the
theoretical inferences, and the results support power-law distance decay. A
conclusion can be reached that the preferred form of geographical gravity model
is its original form, which is based on an inverse power law rather than a
negative exponential law.

question answering (QA) systems. A cased-based reasoning (CBR) system judges
answer candidates for questions from annotated answer candidates for earlier
questions. The promise of this approach is that user feedback will result in
improved answers of the QA system, due to the growing case base. In the paper,
I present the adequate structuring of the case base and the appropriate
selection of relevant similarity measures, in order to solve the answer
validation problem. The structural case base is built from annotated MultiNet
graphs, which provide representations for natural language expressions, and
corresponding graph similarity measures. I cover a priori relations to
experienced answer candidates for former questions. I compare the CBR System
results to current approaches in an experiment integrating CBR into an existing
framework for answer validation and reranking. This integration is achieved by
adding CBR-related features to the input of a learned ranking model that
determines the final answer ranking. In the experiments based on QA@CLEF
questions, the best learned models make heavy use of CBR features. Observing
the results with a continually growing case base, I present a positive effect
of the size of the case base on the accuracy of the CBR subsystem.

years of quiescence in mid-January 2014. We studied the broad-band, persistent,
X-ray spectrum using X-ray data from a XMM-Newton observation, performed almost
at the peak of the outburst, and from a close INTEGRAL observation, performed 3
days later, thus covering the 1.3-70.0 keV band. The spectrum shows a complex
continuum shape that cannot be modelled with standard high-mass X-ray pulsar
models, nor by two-components models. We observe broadband and peaked residuals
from 4 to 15 keV, and we propose a self-consistent interpretation of these
residuals, assuming they are produced by cyclotron absorption features and by a
moderately smeared, highly ionized, reflection component. We identify the
cyclotron fundamental at $\sim$ 4.7 keV, with hints for two possible harmonics
at 10.4 keV and 15.8 keV. The position of the cyclotron fundamental allows an
estimate for the pulsar magnetic field of (5.27 $\pm$ 0.06) $\times$ 10$^{11}$
G, if the feature is produced at its surface. From the dynamical and
relativistic smearing of the disk reflected component, we obtain a lower limit
estimate for the truncated accretion disk inner radius, ($\gtrsim$ 100 R$_g$),
and for the inclination angle (18$^{\circ}$-48$^{\circ}$). We also detect the
presence of a softer thermal component, that we associate with the emission
from an accretion disk truncated at a distance from the pulsar of 50-115 R$_g$.
From these estimates, we derive the magneto-spheric radius for disk accretion
to be $\sim$ 0.2 times the classical Alfv\'en radius for radial accretion.

magnetic null point and the corresponding spine and separatrix surface are

the filament along the highly complex and fragmented polarity inversion line.
After being activated, the sigmoidal filament erupted and split into two parts.
The major part rose at the speeds of 90$-$150 km s$^{-1}$ before reaching the
maximum apparent height of $\sim$115 Mm. Afterwards, it returned to the solar
surface in a bumpy way at the speeds of 20$-$80 km s$^{-1}$. The rising and
falling motions were clearly observed in the extreme-ultravoilet (EUV), UV, and
H$\alpha$ wavelengths. The failed eruption of the main part was associated with
an M6.7 flare with a single hard X-ray source. The runaway part of the
filament, however, separated from and rotated around the major part for $\sim$1
turn at the eastern leg before escaping from the corona, probably along
large-scale open magnetic field lines. The ejection of the runaway part
resulted in a very faint coronal mass ejection (CME) that propagated at an
apparent speed of 214 km s$^{-1}$ in the outer corona. The filament eruption
also triggered transverse kink-mode oscillation of the adjacent coronal loops
in the same AR. The amplitude and period of the oscillation were 1.6 Mm and 225
s. Our results are important for understanding the mechanisms of partial
filament eruptions and provide new constraints to theoretical models. The

modification of the spherical collapse model (SCM), and its performance in
predicting the limits of bound structure in N-body simulations is compared to
that of two previous models with the aid of new software named COLDGaS--
compute unified device architecture (CUDA) object location determination in
GADGET2 snapshots -- which was developed by the author. All of these models can
be distilled down to a single unique parameter {\xi}, here named the critical
parameter, which was found to have values of 3 and 1.18 from the previous
studies, and a value of 1.89 from the modified SCM. While still on the
conservative side, this new model tends to better identify what structure is
gravitationally bound in simulations. All three analytical models are applied
to the Corona Borealis supercluster, with the modified SCM and {\xi} = 1.18
model making predictions that are in agreement with recent work showing that
A2056, A2061, A2065, A2067, and A2089 comprise a gravitationally bound
supercluster. As an additional test, the modified SCM is used to estimate the
mass within the turn around radius of the Virgo cluster, providing results in
good agreement with studies relating the virial mass of clusters to the total
mass within turn around.

undersampling the k-space data. Methods: A fast orthogonal dictionary learning
method is introduced into magnetic resonance image reconstruction to providing
adaptive sparse representation of images. To enhance the sparsity, image is
divided into classified patches according to the same geometrical direction and
dictionary is trained within each class. A new sparse reconstruction model with
the multi-class dictionaries is proposed and solved using a fast alternating
direction method of multipliers. Results: Experiments on phantom and brain
imaging data with acceleration factor up to 10 and various undersampling
patterns are conducted. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art
magnetic resonance image reconstruction methods. Conclusion: Artifacts are
better suppressed and image edges are better preserved than the compared
methods. Besides, the computation of the proposed approach is much faster than
the typical K-SVD dictionary learning method in magnetic resonance image

in the medium enhance the yield of low-energy electrons. The maximal
enhancement is observed for electrons in the energy range where plasmons, which
are excited in the nanoparticles, play the dominant role. Electron yield from a

a mechanism of increase of the low-energy electron yield, similar to the case
of sensitizing metal nanoparticles. This observation gives a hint for
investigation of novel types of sensitizers to be composed of metallic and

incentivizing users to behave in such a way that society as a whole benefits.
In order to perceive societal level impact, such incentives may take the form
of rewarding users with lottery tickets based on good behavior, and
periodically conducting a lottery to translate these tickets into real rewards.
We will pose the user decision problem as a mean field game (MFG), and the
incentives question as one of trying to select a good mean field equilibrium
(MFE). In such a framework, each agent (a participant in the societal network)
takes a decision based on an assumed distribution of actions of his/her
competitors, and the incentives provided by the social planner. The system is
said to be at MFE if the agent's action is a sample drawn from the assumed
distribution. We will show the existence of such an MFE under different
settings, and also illustrate how to choose an attractive equilibrium using as
an example demand-response in energy networks.

We explore the problem of the site of production of Eu. We use also the
information present in the observed spread in the Eu abundances in the early
Galaxy, not only its average trend. Moreover, we extend to other heavy elements
(Ba, Sr, Rb, Zr) our investigations to provide additional constraints to our
results. Methods. We adopt a stochastic chemical evolution model taking into
account inhomogeneous mixing. The adopted yields of Eu from neutron star
mergers (NSM) and from core-collapse supernovae (SNII) are those that are able
to explain the average [Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] trend observed for solar neighborhood
stars, in the framework of a well-tested homogeneous model for the chemical
evolution of the MilkyWay. Rb, Sr, Zr, and Ba are produced by both the s- and
r-process. The s-process contribution by spinstars is the same as in our
previous papers. Results. NSM that merge in less than 10 Myr or NSM combined
with a source of r-process generated by massive stars can explain the spread of
[Eu/Fe] in the Galactic halo. The combination of r-process production by NSM
and s-process production by spinstars is able to reproduce the available
observational data for Sr, Zr and Ba. We also show the first predictions for Rb
in the Galactic halo. Conclusions. We confirm previous results that either NSM
with very short time scale or both NSM and at least a fraction of SNII should
have contributed to the synthesis of Eu in the Galaxy. The r-process production
by NSM - complemented by an s-process production by spinstars - provide results
compatible with our previous findings based on other r-process sites. We
critically discuss the weak and strong points of both NSM and SNII scenarios
for producing Eu and eventually suggest that the best solution is probably a
mixed one in which both sources produce Eu. In fact, this scenario better
reproduces the scatter observed in all the studied elements. [abridged]

challenging. An important factor than might help improving performance is the
capability to correctly predict network throughput dynamics on short to medium
timescales. It becomes notably difficult in wireless networks that are often
subject to continuous throughput fluctuations.
  In the present work, we develop an adaptation algorithm for HTTP-Based
Adaptive Live Streaming that, for each adaptation decision, maximizes a
QoE-based utility function depending on the probability of playback
interruptions, average video quality, and the amount of video quality
fluctuations. To compute the utility function the algorithm leverages
throughput predictions, and dynamically estimated prediction accuracy.
  We are trying to close the gap created by the lack of studies analyzing TCP
throughput on short to medium timescales. We study several time series
prediction methods and their error distributions. We observe that Simple Moving
Average performs best in most cases. We also observe that the relative
underestimation error is best represented by a truncated normal distribution,
while the relative overestimation error is best represented by a Lomax
distribution. Moreover, underestimations and overestimations exhibit a temporal
correlation that we use to further improve prediction accuracy.
  We compare the proposed algorithm with a baseline approach that uses a fixed
margin between past throughput and selected media bit rate, and an oracle-based
approach that has perfect knowledge over future throughput for a certain time
horizon.

quantum molecular dynamics (NA-QMD) analysis of C$_{60}$+C$_{60}$ collisions
reveals that the dominant excitation of an exceptionally ""giant"" oblate-prolate

microscopic calculations, a macroscopic collision model is derived, which
reproduces the NA-QMD results. Moreover, it predicts analytically fusion
barriers for different fullerene-fullerene combinations in excellent agreement

number was obtained and analysis of equilibria was shown. We brought along a
discussion on the application of optimal control to the model in which two
simultaneous schemes were introduced. The first scheme is done by disseminating
chemical like temephos in spots where eggs and larvae develop, meanwhile the
second scheme is done by deploying fumigation through areas where adult
mosquitoes prevalently nest, indoor as well as outdoor. A version of the
gradient-based method was presented to set up a workflow in minimizing the
objective functional with respect to some control variables. Numerical results
from the analysis of the basic mosquito offspring number with constant control
and from that with optimal control suggested that the application of fumigation
is preferable over that of temephos. It was also suggested that applying both
control schemes simultaneously gives the most significant reduction in the
population.

central step in and the computationally most expensive part of statistical

convex sets. Compared with a CPU implementation our CUDA implementation is one
order of magnitude faster. For a further speed up and to reduce memory
consumption we have developed a new variant, which we call incomplete Dykstra's

CUDA implementation of the standard Dykstra algorithm. As sample application we
discuss using the incomplete Dykstra's algorithm as preprocessor for the
recently developed super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) method
(Dertinger et al. 2009). We show that statistical multi-resolution estimation
can enhance the resolution improvement of the plain SOFI algorithm just as the
Fourier-reweighting of SOFI. The results are compared in terms of their power
spectrum and their Fourier ring correlation (Saxton and Baumeister 1982). The
Fourier ring correlation indicates that the resolution for typical second order
SOFI images can be improved by about 30 per cent. Our results show that a
careful parallelization of Dykstra's algorithm enables its use in large-scale
