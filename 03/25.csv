the third order derivative of the position vector. Hyperjerks are the n-th
order derivatives with n>3. This paper describes the relations, for jerks and
hyperjerks, between the quantities measured in an inertial frame of reference
and those observed in a rotating frame. These relations can be interesting for
teaching purposes.

the parent phase NaFeAs under a uniaxial pressure. Although significant
difference of the in-plane resistivity $\rho_{xx}(I\parallel a)$ and
$\rho_{xx}(I\parallel b)$ with the uniaxial pressure along $b$-axis was
observed, the transverse resistivity $\rho_{xy}$ shows a surprisingly isotropic
behavior. Detailed analysis reveals that the Hall coefficient $R_\mathrm{H}$
measured in the two orthogonal configurations ($I\parallel a$-axis and
$I\parallel b$-axis) coincide very well and exhibit a deviation from the high
temperature background at around the structural transition temperature
$T_{\mathrm{s}}$. Furthermore, the magnitude of $R_\mathrm{H}$ increases
remarkably below the structural transition temperature. This enhanced Hall
coefficient is accompanied by the non-linear transverse resistivity versus
magnetic field and enhanced magnetoresistance, which can be explained very well
by the two band model with anisotropic mobilities of each band. Our results
together with the two band model analysis clearly show that the anisotropic
in-plane resistivity in the nematic state is closely related to the distinct
quasiparticle mobilities when they are moving parallel or perpendicular to the
direction of the uniaxial pressure.

devices referred to as the Internet of Things - IoT. In conjunction, the
advances in machine learning have allowed building models on this ever

suggested that it is possible to define distribution functions for such systems

create radial density and velocity distributions for comparison to those from
simulations. A wide variety of $N$-body code conditions are used to reduce the
chance that results are biased by numerical issues. We find that a subset of

by these models, and that direct calculation of the entropy shows maximum

(2DEG) buried in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The graphene forms Schottky
barriers at the surface of the heterostructure and therefore allows tuning the
electronic density of the 2DEG. Conversely, the 2DEG potential can tune the
graphene Fermi energy. Graphene-defined quantum point contacts in the 2DEG show
half-plateaus of quantized conductance in finite bias spectroscopy and display
the 0.7 anomaly for a large range of densities in the constriction, testifying
to their good electronic properties. Finally, we demonstrate that the GaAs
nanostructure can detect charges in the vicinity of the heterostructure's
surface. This confirms the strong coupling of the hybrid device: localized
states in the graphene ribbon could in principle be probed by the underlying
confined channel. The present hybrid graphene/GaAs nanostructures are promising
for the investigation of strong interactions and coherent coupling between the
two fundamentally different materials.

predictive density based on the Bayesian marginal likelihood from a frequentist
point of view. We derive criteria for selecting variables in linear regression
models, assuming a prior distribution of the regression coefficients. Then, we
discuss the relationship between the proposed criteria and related criteria.
There are three advantages of our method. First, this is a compromise between
the frequentist and Bayesian standpoints because it evaluates the frequentist's
risk of the Bayesian model. Thus, it is less influenced by a prior
misspecification. Second, the criteria exhibits consistency when selecting the
true model. Third, when a uniform prior is assumed for the regression
coefficients, the resulting criterion is equivalent to the residual information
criterion (RIC) of Shi and Tsai (2002).

define spectrum allocation and spectrum sharing policies. Numerical results
show that SVM is the best algorithm among all the supervised and unsupervised

an explicit expression for the asymptotic probability density of the

general idea behind the method is the same as for the earlier considered case
of the Circular Unitary Ensemble, the present GUE case poses new challenges. In
particular we show how the conjectured {\it self-duality} in the freezing
scenario plays the crucial role in our selection of the form of the maximum
distribution. Finally, we demonstrate a good agreement of the found probability
density with the results of direct numerical simulations of the maxima of

This is the perturbative pure gravity partition function in three dimensions.
We employ a sewing construction, in which the partition function is expressed
as a sum of sphere four-point functions of Virasoro vacuum descendants. For
this purpose, we develop techniques to efficiently compute correlation
functions of holomorphic operators, which by crossing symmetry are determined
exactly by a finite number of OPE coefficients; this is an analytic
implementation of the conformal bootstrap. Expanding the results in $1/c$,
corresponding to the semiclassical bulk gravity expansion, we find
that---unlike at genus one---the result does not truncate at finite loop order.
Our results also allow us to extend earlier work on multiple-interval Renyi
entropies and on the partition function in the separating degeneration limit.

imperfections, in the form of missing links, is considered. We investigate two
regimes, statical and dynamical percolation, that correspond to different time
scales for the imperfections evolution with respect to the quantum-walk one. By
studying the qualitative behaviour of three two-particle quantities for
different probabilities of having missing bonds, we argue that the chosen
symmetry under particle-exchange of the input state strongly affects the output
of the walk, even in noisy and highly non-ideal regimes. We provide evidence
against the possibility of gathering information about the walkers
indistinguishability from the observation of bunching phenomena in the output
distribution, in all those situations that require a comparison between
averaged quantities. Although the spread of the walk is not substantially
changed by the addition of a second particle, we show that the presence of
multiple walkers can be beneficial for a procedure to estimate the probability

heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell
division. What is remarkable about cancers is their homogeneity - virtually
every neoplastic cell within a large cancer contains the same core set of
genetic alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that have emerged
after the last clonal expansions. How such clones expand within the
spatially-constrained three dimensional architecture of a tumor, and come to
dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has never been explained. We here
describe a model for tumor evolution that shows how short-range migration and
cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside the tumor. With it, we
show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within a large
tumor allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass in a
clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms
can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model
not only provides novel insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumor
growth but also suggests that targeting short range cellular migratory activity
could have dramatic effects on tumor growth rates.

algebra over the field of complex numbers with $m$ idempotents. Let
$e_1=1,e_2,\ldots,e_k$ with $2\leq k\leq 2n$ be elements of $\mathbb{A}_n^m$
which are linearly independent over the field of real numbers. We consider
monogenic (i.~e. continuous and differentiable in the sense of Gateaux)
functions of the variable $\sum_{j=1}^k x_j\,e_j$, where $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k$
are real, and obtain a constructive description of all mentioned functions by
means of holomorphic functions of complex variables. It follows from this
description that monogenic functions have Gateaux derivatives of all orders.
The present article is generalized of the author's paper [1], where mentioned
results are obtained for $k=3$.

Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory (Tibet, People's Republic of China, 4300 m
a.s.l.). The high altitude, combined with the full-coverage technique, allows
the detection of extensive air showers in a wide energy range and offer the
possibility of measuring the cosmic ray proton plus helium spectrum down to the
TeV region, where direct balloon/space-borne measurements are available. The
detector has been in stable data taking in its full configuration from November
2007 to February 2013. In this paper the measurement of the cosmic ray proton
plus helium energy spectrum is presented in the region 3-300 TeV by analyzing
the full collected data sample. The resulting spectral index is $\gamma = -2.64
\pm 0.01$. These results demonstrate the possibility of performing an accurate

In the $q^2$ intervals where the signal is observed, angular distributions are
studied and the forward-backward asymmetries in the dimuon ($A^{l}_{\rm FB}$)

computing approximate factorizations of matrices that have low numerical rank.
This paper describes an extension of such techniques to a wider class of
matrices that are not themselves rank-deficient, but have off-diagonal blocks
that are; specifically, the classes of so called \textit{Hierarchically
Off-Diagonal Low Rank (HODLR)} matrices and \textit{Hierarchically Block
Separable (HBS)} matrices. Such matrices arise frequently in numerical analysis
and signal processing, in particular in the construction of fast methods for
solving differential and integral equations numerically. These structures admit
algebraic operations (matrix-vector multiplications, matrix factorizations,
matrix inversion, etc.) to be performed very rapidly; but only once a
data-sparse representation of the matrix has been constructed. How to rapidly
compute this representation in the first place is much less well understood.
The present paper demonstrates that if an $N\times N$ matrix can be applied to
a vector in $O(N)$ time, and if the ranks of the off-diagonal blocks are
bounded by an integer $k$, then the cost for constructing a HODLR
representation is $O(k^{2}\,N\,(\log N)^{2})$, and the cost for constructing an
HBS representation is $O(k^{2}\,N\,\log N)$. The point is that when legacy
codes (based on, e.g., the Fast Multipole Method) can be used for the fast
matrix-vector multiply, the proposed algorithm can be used to obtain the
data-sparse representation of the matrix, and then well-established techniques
for HODLR/HBS matrices can be used to invert or factor the matrix. The proposed
scheme is also useful in simplifying the implementation of certain operations
on rank-structured matrices such as the matrix-matrix multiplication, low-rank
update, addition, etc.

a unified understanding of aging changes. In the situation of a severe injury,
incorrect repair is a repair essential for maintaining structural integrity for
increasing the surviving chance of an organism. With the same mechanism as that
in ""Misrepair of DNA"" , the term of ""Misrepair"" can be used for describing all
kinds of incorrect repairs on different types of living structures, including
molecules, cells and tissues. A new concept of Misrepair is therefore proposed
and defined as incorrect reconstruction of an injured living structure.
Misrepair mechanism is beneficial for the survival of an organism, and it is
essential for the survival of a species. III. Alteration of structure made by
Misrepair is irreversible; therefore Misrepairs accumulate and disorganize
gradually a structure, which appears as aging of it. Accumulation of Misrepairs
takes place on molecular, cellular and tissue levels respectively: on tissue
level, it appears as disorganization of cells and extracellular matrixes
(ECMs); on cellular level, it appears as deformation of cytoskeleton and change
of cell shape; and on DNA, it appears as accumulation of DNA mutations and
alteration of DNA sequence. An essential change in aging of an organism is an
irreversible change of the spatial relationship between cells/ECMs in a tissue.
In conclusion, aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of Misrepairs
on tissue level.

massive, compact, star-forming galaxy (SFG) at a redshift $z\sim1.7$. Its
spectrum reveals both H$_{\alpha}$ and [NII] emission lines and strong Balmer
absorption lines. The H$_{\alpha}$ and Spitzer MIPS 24 $\mu$m fluxes are both
weak, thus indicating a low star formation rate of SFR $\lesssim5-10$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This, added to a relatively young age of $\sim700$ Myr
measured from the absorption lines, provides the first direct evidence for a
distant galaxy being caught in the act of rapidly shutting down its star
formation. Such quenching allows GDN-8231 to become a compact, quiescent
galaxy, similar to 3 other galaxies in our sample, by $z\sim1.5$. Moreover, the
color profile of GDN-8231 shows a bluer center, consistent with the predictions
of recent simulations for an early phase of inside-out quenching. Its
line-of-sight velocity dispersion for the gas, $\sigma^{\rm{gas}}_{\!_{\rm
LOS}}=127\pm32$ km s$^{-1}$, is nearly 40% smaller than that of its stars,
$\sigma^{\star}_{\!_{\rm LOS}}=215\pm35$ km s$^{-1}$. High-resolution
hydro-simulations of galaxies explain such apparently colder gas kinematics of
up to a factor of $\sim1.5$ with rotating disks being viewed at different
inclinations and/or centrally concentrated star-forming regions. A clear
prediction is that their compact, quiescent descendants preserve some remnant
rotation from their star-forming progenitors.

the potassium feature in the line wing at 7582.0 {\AA} and the line core at
7664.9 {\AA} using a 12 {\AA} filter width (R~650). The planet-to-star radius
ratios in the continuum are found to be $R_{\rm{pl}}/R_{\star}$ = 0.1176 $\pm$

$R_{\rm{pl}}/R_{\star}$ = 0.1248 $\pm$ 0.0014 in the line wing at 7582.0 {\AA}
and $R_{\rm{pl}}/R_{\star}$ = 0.1268 $\pm$ 0.0012 in the line core at 7664.9
{\AA}. With a weighted mean of the observations outside the potassium feature
$R_{\rm{pl}}/R_{\star}$ = 0.1174 $\pm$ 0.0010, the potassium is detected as an
increase in the radius ratio of {\Delta}$R_{\rm{pl}}/R_{\star}$ = 0.0073 $\pm$

0.0016 at 7664.9 {\AA} (a significance of 4.3 and 6.1 $\sigma$ respectively).
We hypothesise that the strong detection of potassium is caused by a large
scale height, which can be explained by a high-temperature at the base of the

molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen by the EUV flux from the host star may
also partly explain the amplitude of our detection.

As expected, the photometry and overall galaxy sizes imply purely passive
evolution of stellar populations in red sequence cluster galaxies. However, the
morphologies of red sequence cluster galaxies at these redshifts show
significant differences to those of local counterparts. Apart from the most
massive galaxies, the high redshift red sequence galaxies are significantly
diskier than their low redshift analogues. These galaxies also show significant
colour gradients, again not present in their low redshift equivalents, most
straightforwardly explained by radial age gradients. A clear implication of
these findings is that red sequence cluster galaxies originally arrive on the
sequence as disk-dominated galaxies whose disks subsequently fade or evolve
secularly to end up as high S\'ersic index early-type galaxies (classical S0s
or possibly ellipticals) at lower redshift. The apparent lack of growth seen in
a comparison of high and low redshift red sequence galaxies implies that any
evolution is internal and is unlikely to involve significant mergers. While
significant star formation may have ended at high redshift, the cluster red
sequence population continues to evolve (morphologically) for several Gyrs
thereafter.

we show that the QSO contribution to $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ is higher by a factor ~2

combinations of star formation rate density and dust attenuation, we show that
a typical UV escape fraction of 4% from star forming galaxies should be
sufficient to explain the inferred $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ by Kollmeier et al.

explain the recently inferred $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ by Shull et al. (2015) which
used the same observational data but different simulation. Therefore, we
conclude that the crisis is not as severe as it was perceived before and there

the radiative processes in atmospheres of magnetars and by scattering in the
upper magnetospheres. We construct a self-consistent physical model that
incorporates emission from the magnetar surface and its reprocessing in the
three-dimensional (3D) twisted magnetosphere using a Monte Carlo technique. The
synthetic spectra are characterized by four parameters: surface temperature kT,
surface magnetic field strength $B$, magnetospheric twist angle $\Delta\phi$,

for 7 out of the 11 sources are consistent with the values inferred from the

robust method to measure the magnetic field strength and magnetospheric
configuration of AXPs and SGRs. Investigating the multiple observations of

problem. In particular, limited or incomplete data may substantially affect the
analysis. In this paper we develop a Bayesian method to deal with incomplete

velocity components of tracers as parameters in the model. We explore the
effectiveness of our model using simulated data, and then apply our method to
the Milky Way using velocity and position data from globular clusters and dwarf

effect on the total mass estimate. However, the results are quite sensitive to
the outer globular cluster Pal 3. Using a basic Hernquist model with an
isotropic velocity dispersion, we obtain credible regions for the cumulative
mass profile M(r) of the Milky Way, and provide estimates for the model
parameters with 95 percent Bayesian credible intervals. The mass contained

inclusive J/$\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$
TeV, in three center-of-mass rapidity ($y_{\rm cms}$) regions, down to zero
$p_{\rm T}$. Results in the forward and backward rapidity ranges ($2.03 <
y_{\rm cms} < 3.53$ and $-4.46 <y_{\rm cms}< -2.96$) are obtained by studying
the J/$\psi$ decay to $\mu^+\mu^-$, while the mid-rapidity region ($-1.37 <
y_{\rm cms} < 0.43$) is investigated by measuring the ${\rm e}^+{\rm e}^-$
decay channel. The $p_{\rm T}$ dependence of the J/$\psi$ production cross
section and nuclear modification factor are presented for each of the rapidity
intervals, as well as the J/$\psi$ mean $p_{\rm T}$ values. Forward and
mid-rapidity results show a suppression of the J/$\psi$ yield, with respect to
pp collisions, which decreases with increasing $p_{\rm T}$. At backward
rapidity no significant J/$\psi$ suppression is observed. Theoretical models
including a combination of cold nuclear matter effects such as shadowing and
partonic energy loss, are in fair agreement with the data, except at forward
rapidity and low transverse momentum. The implications of the p-Pb results for
the evaluation of cold nuclear matter effects on J/$\psi$ production in Pb-Pb
collisions are also discussed.

change in Fe-bearing MgSiO$_3$. Using DFT+U calculations, we have investigated
pressure induced spin state changes in Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ in MgGeO$_3$

germanium compared to silicon, germanate phases have larger unit cell volume

As a result, all pressure induced state changes in iron occur at higher

that iron state transitions occur at particular average Fe-O bond-length

fundamental physics because these systems are tunable, well characterized, and
isolated from the environment. Controlled disorder can be introduced to explore
suppression of quantum diffusion in the absence of conventional dephasing
mechanisms such as phonons, which are unavoidable in experiments on electronic
solids. Recent experiments use transport of degenerate Fermi gases in optical
lattices (Kondov et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 083002 (2015)) to probe a
particularly extreme regime of strong interaction in what can be modeled as an
Anderson-Hubbard model. These experiments find evidence for an intriguing
insulating phase where quantum diffusion is completely suppressed by strong
disorder. Quantitative interpretation of these experiments remains an open
problem that requires inclusion of non-zero entropy, strong interaction, and
trapping. We argue that the suppression of transport can be thought of as
localization of Hubbard-band quasiparticles. We construct a theory of transport
of Hubbard-band quasiparticles tailored to trapped optical lattice experiments.
We compare the theory directly with center-of-mass transport experiments of
Kondov et al. with no fitting parameters. The close agreement between theory
and experiments shows that the suppression of transport is only partly due to
finite entropy effects. We argue that the complete suppression of transport is
consistent with Anderson localization of Hubbard-band quasiparticles. The
combination of our theoretical framework and optical lattice experiments offers
an important platform for studying localization in isolated many-body quantum
systems.

radioactive sources and the attenuation map using not only ballistic
measurements but also first order scattering measurements. The problem is
modeled using the radiative transfer equation by means of an explicit nonlinear
operator that gives the ballistic and scattering measurements as a function of
the radioactive source and attenuation distributions. First, by differentiating
this nonlinear operator we obtain a linearized inverse problem. Then, under
regularity hypothesis for the source distribution and attenuation map and
considering small attenuations, we rigorously prove that the linear operator is
invertible and we compute its inverse explicitly. This allows to prove local
uniqueness for the nonlinear inverse problem. Finally, using the previous
inversion result for the linear operator, we propose a new type of iterative
algorithm for simultaneous source and attenuation recovery for SPECT based on
Neumann series and a Newton-Raphson algorithm.

form following the buckling instability of a bar. From studies of analytical

bulges are supported by ""bananas"", or x1v1 orbits. We present here a set of
N-body models where instead the peanut bulge is mainly supported by brezel-like
orbits, allowing strong peanuts to form with short extent relative to the bar
length. This shows that stars in the X-shape do not necessarily stream along
banana orbits which follow the arms of the X-shape. The brezel orbits are also
found to be the main orbital component supporting the peanut shape in our
recent Made-to-Measure dynamical models of the Galactic bulge. We also show
that in these models the fraction of stellar orbits that contribute to the
X-structure account for 40-45% of the stellar mass.

source of the accelerated expansion of the universe and linear perturbation

However, smaller non-linear scales offer a richer phenomenology with which to
constrain modified gravity theories. Here, we consider the Hu-Sawicki form of
$f(R)$ gravity and apply the post-Friedmann approach to derive the leading
order equations for non-linear scales, i.e. the equations valid in the
Newtonian-like regime. We reproduce the standard equations for the scalar
field, gravitational slip and the modified Poisson equation in a coherent
framework. In addition, we derive the equation for the leading order correction
to the Newtonian regime, the vector potential. We measure this vector potential
from $f(R)$ N-body simulations at redshift zero and one, for two values of the
$f_{R_0}$ parameter. We find that the vector potential at redshift zero in
$f(R)$ gravity can be close to 50\% larger than in GR on small scales for
$|f_{R_0}|=1.289\times10^{-5}$, although this is less for larger scales,
earlier times and smaller values of the $f_{R_0}$ parameter. Similarly to in
GR, the small amplitude of this vector potential suggests that the Newtonian
approximation is highly accurate for $f(R)$ gravity, and also that the
non-linear cosmological behaviour of $f(R)$ gravity can be completely described
by just the scalar potentials and the $f(R)$ field.

However, observers return to importance for the prediction of first person
probabilities for what we observe of the universe: What is most probable to be
observed is not necessarily what is most probable to occur. This essay reviews
the basic framework for the computation of first person probabilities in
quantum cosmology starting with an analysis of very simple models. It is shown
that anthropic selection is automatic in this framework, because there is no
probability for us to observe what is where we cannot exist. First person
probabilities generally favor larger universes resulting from inflation where
there are more places for us to be. In very large universes it is probable that
our observational situation is duplicated elsewhere. The calculation of first
person probabilities then requires a specification of whether our particular
situation is assumed to be typical of all the others. It is the combination of
the model of the observational situation, including this typicality assumption,
and the third person theory which is tested by observation. We conclude with a
discussion of the first person predictions of cosmological observables such as
the cosmological constant and features of the primordial density fluctuations,
in the no-boundary quantum state of the universe and a dynamical theory in
which these are allowed to vary.

localized on $(d-1)$-dimensional boundaries, their creation requires operations
acting on all qubits inside the boundaries, reflecting the non-triviality of
emerging SPT wavefunctions. Moreover, these SPT-excitations can be physically
realized as transparent gapped domain walls which exchange excitations in the
color code. Namely, in the three-dimensional color code, the domain wall,
associated with the transversal $R_{3}$ operator, exchanges a magnetic flux and
a composite of a magnetic flux and loop-like SPT excitation, revealing rich
possibilities of boundaries in higher-dimensional TQFTs. We also find that
magnetic fluxes and loop-like SPT excitations exhibit non-trivial three-loop
braiding statistics in three dimensions as a result of the fact that the
$R_{3}$ phase operator belongs to the third-level of the Clifford hierarchy. We
believe that the connection between SPT excitations, fault-tolerant logical

algebra in terms of Lorentz-tensors for bosons, and tensor-spinors for

the cumbersome matrix calculus and higher \partial^{2j} order wave equations
inherent to the Weinberg-Joos approach. We start with reducible Lorentz-tensor
(tensor-spinor) representation spaces hosting one sole (j,0)+(0,j) irreducible
sector and design there a representation reduction algorithm based on one of
the Casimir invariants of the Lorentz algebra. This algorithm allows us to
separate neatly the pure spin-j sector of interest from the rest, while
preserving the separate Lorentz- and Dirac indexes. However, the Lorentz
invariants are momentum independent and do not provide wave equations. Genuine
wave equations are obtained by conditioning the Lorentz-tensors under
consideration to satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation. In so doing, one always
ends up with wave equations and associated Lagrangians that are second order in
the momenta. Specifically, a spin-3/2 particle transforming as (3/2,0)+ (0,3/2)
is comfortably described by a second order Lagrangian in the basis of the
totally antisymmetric Lorentz tensor-spinor of second rank, \Psi_[ \mu\nu].
Moreover, the particle is shown to propagate causally within an electromagnetic
background. In our study of (3/2,0)+(0,3/2) as part of \Psi_[\mu\nu] we
reproduce the electromagnetic multipole moments known from the Weinberg-Joos
theory. We also find a Compton differential cross section that satisfies
unitarity in forward direction. The suggested tensor calculus presents itself
very computer friendly with respect to the symbolic software FeynCalc.

our first view of an individual first star may be possible due to its
explosion. In this work, we present evolution calculations for Population III
(Pop III) stars and their subsequent supernovae explosions. Our evolution
models include a mass range of 15 - 100 M$_\odot$, each with initial heavy
element abundance Z = 10-14. Our models are evolved from pre-main sequence
through formation of an iron core, and thus near to core collapse. We find that
modelling the evolution of these stars is very sensitive to the choice of
convection criterion; here we provide evolution results using both the
Schwarzschild and Ledoux criteria. We also use the final structure from our
models for numerical simulation of their supernovae light curves using a
radiation hydrodynamics code. In doing so, we estimate a lower bound of initial
model mass that may be possible to observe in the near future. We also find
that our 40 M$_\odot$ Schwarzschild evolution model produces the brightest
supernova peak and statistically should be the most frequently observed. At our
highest redshift z= 15, only the 60 M$_\odot$ Schwarzschild model at peak
magnitude starts to rival the 40 M$_\odot$ model in brightness.

from chondritic meteorites formed in a hot environment in the solar
protoplanetary disk, the conditions of their formation remain debated. Recent
laboratory studies of CAIs have provided new kind of data: their size
distributions. We show that size distributions of CAIs measured in laboratory
from sections of carbonaceous chondrites have a power law size distribution
with cumulative size exponent between -1.7 and -1.9, which translates into
cumulative size exponent between -2.5 and -2.8 after correction for sectioning.
To explain these observations, numerical simulations were run to explore the
growth of CAIs from micrometer to centimeter sizes, in a hot and turbulent
protoplanetary disk through the competition of coagulation and fragmentation.
We show that the size distributions obtained in growth simulations are in
agreement with CAIs size distributions in meteorites. We explain the CAI sharp
cut-off of their size distribution at centimeter sizes as the direct result
from the famous fragmentation barrier, provided that CAI fragment for impact
velocities larger than 10 m/s. The growth/destruction timescales of millimeter-
and centimeter-sized CAIs is inversely proportional to the local dust/gas ratio
and is about 10 years at 1300 K and up to 104 years at 1670K. This implies that
the most refractory CAIs are expected to be smaller in size owing to their long
growth timescale compared to less refractory CAIs. Conversely, the least
refractory CAIs could have been recycled many times during the CAI production
era which may have profound consequences for their radiometric age.

framework introduced by Stojnic and heavily relies on the use of Gordon's
Gaussian min-max theorem (GMT), a comparison principle on Gaussian processes.
As a result, corresponding characterizations for other ensembles of measurement
matrices have not been developed. In this work, we analyze the corresponding
performance of the ensemble of isotropically random orthogonal (i.r.o.)
measurements. We consider the constrained version of the Generalized LASSO and
derive a sharp characterization of its normalized squared error in the
large-system limit. When compared to its Gaussian counterpart, our result
analytically confirms the superiority in performance of the i.r.o. ensemble.
Our second result, derives an asymptotic lower bound on the minimum conic
singular values of i.r.o. matrices. This bound is larger than the corresponding
bound on Gaussian matrices. To prove our results we express i.r.o. matrices in
terms of Gaussians and show that, with some modifications, the GMT framework is
still applicable.

able to this directly by just using the $L^{p}$-bounds for spectral projection
operators from our much earlier work \cite{Seig}. The localized bounds we
obtain here imply, for instance, that, for a density one sequence of
eigenvalues on a manifold whose geodesic flow is ergodic, all of the $L^p$,
$2<p\le \infty$, bounds of the corresponding eigenfunctions are relatively
small compared to the general ones in \cite{Seig}, which are saturated on round
spheres. The connection with quantum ergodicity was established for exponents
$2<p<p_c$ in the recent results of the author \cite{SK} and Blair and the
author \cite{BS2}; however, the article of Hezari and Rivi\`ere~\cite{HR} was
the first one to make this connection (in the case of negatively curved
manifolds) for the critical exponent, $p_c$. As is well known, and we indicate
here, bounds for the critical exponent, $p_c$, imply ones for all of the other
exponents $2<p\le \infty$. The localized estimates involve $L^2$-norms over
small geodesic balls $B_r$ of radius $r$, and we shall go over what happens for
these in certain model cases on the sphere and on manifolds of nonpositive
curvature. We shall also state a problem as to when one can improve on the
trivial $O(r^{\frac12})$ estimates for these $L^2(B_r)$ bounds. If
$r=\lambda^{-1}$, one can improve on the trivial estimates if one has improved
$L^{p_c}(M)$ bounds just by using H\""older's inequality; however, obtaining
improved bounds for $r\gg \lambda^{-1}$ seems to be subtle.

decreasing to a very small value of 0.09 W/mK in the reduced graphene oxide

strong anisotropy of the thermal conductivity, K/Kc ~ 675, which is
substantially larger even than in the high-quality graphite. The electrical
resistivity of the annealed films reduced to 1 - 19 Ohms/sq. The observed
modifications of the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity components

theoretical analysis suggests that K can reach as high as ~500 W/mK with the
increase in the sp2 domain size and further reduction of the oxygen content.

to improve the performance of graph analysis frameworks without compromising on
productivity. GraphMat is our solution to bridge this gap between a
user-friendly graph analytics framework and native, hand-optimized code.
GraphMat functions by taking vertex programs and mapping them to high
performance sparse matrix operations in the backend. We get the productivity
benefits of a vertex programming framework without sacrificing performance.
GraphMat is in C++, and we have been able to write a diverse set of graph
algorithms in this framework with the same effort compared to other vertex
programming frameworks. GraphMat performs 1.2-7X faster than high performance
frameworks such as GraphLab, CombBLAS and Galois. It achieves better multicore
scalability (13-15X on 24 cores) than other frameworks and is 1.2X off native,
hand-optimized code on a variety of different graph algorithms. Since GraphMat
performance depends mainly on a few scalable and well-understood sparse matrix
operations, GraphMatcan naturally benefit from the trend of increasing
parallelism on future hardware.

The brightest cluster galaxy, CGPG 0719.8+6704, is a pair of interacting
ellipticals with projected separation $\sim$10 kpc, the brighter of which hosts
the radio source 4C +67.13. The Fanaroff-Riley type-II radio morphology of 4C
+67.13 is unusual for central radio galaxies in local Abell clusters. Our new
optical spectroscopy revealed that both nuclei of the CGPG 0719.8+6704 pair are
active, albeit at low accretion rates corresponding to the Eddington ratio
$\sim10^{-4}$ (for the estimated black hole masses of $\sim 3 \times
10^8\,M_\odot$ and $\sim 10^9 \, M_\odot$). The gathered X-ray ({\it Chandra})
data allowed us to confirm and to quantify robustly the previously noted
elongation of the gaseous atmosphere in the dominant sub-cluster, as well as a
large spatial offset ($\sim 60$\,kpc projected) between the position of the
brightest cluster galaxy and the cluster center inferred from the modeling of
the X-ray surface brightness distribution. Detailed analysis of the brightness
profiles and temperature revealed also that the cluster gas in the vicinity of
4C\,+67.13 is compressed (by a factor of about $\sim 1.4$) and heated (from
$\simeq 2.0$\,keV up to 2.7\,keV), consistent with the presence of a weak shock
(Mach number $\sim 1.3$) driven by the expanding jet cocoon. This would then
require the jet kinetic power of the order of $\sim 10^{45}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$,
implying either a very high efficiency of the jet production for the current
accretion rate, or a highly modulated jet/accretion activity in the system.

not only suppressed, but also the minimum of the CV $\times$ noise intensity

(UAVs) for civilian operations such as package delivery, firefighting, and fast
disaster response. As a result, UAV traffic management systems are needed to
support potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the airspace, in
order to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met. Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) reachability is a powerful framework for providing conditions under which
these requirements can be met, and for synthesizing the optimal controller for
meeting them. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, HJ reachability is
only tractable for a small number of vehicles if their set of maneuvers is
unrestricted. In this paper, we define a platoon to be a group of UAVs in a
single-file formation. We model each vehicle as a hybrid system with modes
corresponding to its role in the platoon, and specify the set of allowed
maneuvers in each mode to make the analysis tractable. We propose several
liveness controllers based on HJ reachability, and wrap a safety controller,
also based on HJ reachability, around the liveness controllers. For a single
altitude range, our approach guarantees safety for one safety breach; in the
unlikely event of multiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed over
multiple altitude ranges. We demonstrate the satisfaction of liveness and
safety requirements through simulations of three common scenarios.

particular, we consider the following two design problems: (i) the
nodal-frequency design problem, in which we tune the natural frequencies of the
oscillators given the topology of the network, and (ii) the (robust)
edge-weight design problem, in which we design the edge weights assuming that
the natural frequencies are given (or belong to a given convex uncertainty

evolution of interface (micro)mechanics for interfaces between oil and
bacterial suspensions by following the motion of colloidal probes trapped by
capillarity to determine the interface microrheology. Initially, active
bacteria at and near the interface drive superdiffusive motion of the colloidal
probes. Over timescales of minutes, the bacteria form a viscoelastic film which
we discuss as a quasi-two-dimensional, active, glassy system. To study late
stage mechanics of the film, we use pendant drop elastometry. The films, grown
over tens of hours on oil drops, are expanded and compressed by changing the
drop volume. For small strains, by modeling the films as 2D Hookean solids, we
estimate the film elastic moduli, finding values similar to those reported in
the literature for the bacteria themselves. For large strains, the films are
highly hysteretic. Finally, from wrinkles formed on highly compressed drops, we
estimate film bending energies. The dramatic restructuring of the interface by
such robust films has broad implications, e.g. in the study of active colloids,
in understanding the community dynamics of bacteria, and in applied settings

$^3H_6\rightarrow^3H_4$, taking advantages of high-power high-efficiency laser
diodes at $\sim$0.8 $\mu$m, may not be a superior choice for directly

Meanwhile, using other pump transitions resulting 2-$\mu$m emissions,

scaling. We thus propose tandem-pumped TDFLs for reducing the heat at high

differential thrust based adaptive control approach is proposed to achieve a
stable flight envelope. The propulsion dynamics of the aircraft is modeled as a
system of differential equations with engine time constant and time delay terms
to study the engine response time with respect to a differential thrust input.
The proposed differential thrust control module is then presented to map the

based on the Lyapunov stability approach is implemented to test the ability of
the damaged aircraft to track the model aircraft's (reference) response in an

such differential thrust approach to regain lateral/directional stability of a

In practice, one often has to solve the associated PDE numerically, using, for
instance finite element methods and leading to a discretisation bias, with the
step-size level $h_L$. In addition, the expectation cannot be computed
analytically and one often resorts to Monte Carlo methods. In the context of
this problem, it is known that the introduction of the multilevel Monte Carlo
(MLMC) method can reduce the amount of computational effort to estimate
expectations, for a given level of error. This is achieved via a telescoping
identity associated to a Monte Carlo approximation of a sequence of probability
distributions with discretisation levels $\infty>h_0>h_1\cdots>h_L$. In many
practical problems of interest, one cannot achieve an i.i.d. sampling of the
associated sequence of probability distributions. A sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) version of the MLMC method is introduced to deal with this problem. It is
shown that under appropriate assumptions, the attractive property of a
reduction of the amount of computational effort to estimate expectations, for a

error $1/3$ in the $\ell_\infty$ norm. In an influential result, Aaronson and
Shi (J. ACM 2004) proved tight $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ and
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/3})$ lower bounds on the approximate degree of the
Collision and Element Distinctness functions, respectively. Their proof was
non-constructive, using a sophisticated symmetrization argument and tools from
approximation theory.
  More recently, several open problems in the study of approximate degree have
been resolved via the construction of dual polynomials. These are explicit dual
solutions to an appropriate linear program that captures the approximate degree
of any function. We reprove Aaronson and Shi's results by constructing explicit
dual polynomials for the Collision and Element Distinctness functions.

field is induced inside the multilayer by the transducer of a stripline
Broadband Ferromagnetic Resonance (BFMR) setup. By means of a rigorous
numerical solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation consistently with
the Maxwell's equations, we investigate the magnetisation dynamics in the
multilayer. We reveal a strong photon-magnon coupling, which manifests itself
as anti-crossing of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) magnon mode supported by
the YIG layer and the electromagnetic resonance mode supported by the whole
multilayered structure. The frequency of the magnon mode depends on the
external static magnetic field, which in our case is applied tangentially to
the multilayer in the direction perpendicular to the microwave magnetic field
induced by the stripline of the BFMR setup. The frequency of the
electromagnetic mode is independent of the static magnetic field. Consequently,
the predicted photon-magnon coupling is sensitive to the applied magnetic field

simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability achievable thanks to the

polymer lubrication between parallel plates. The rheological properties,
conformational change of polymer chains, and temperature rise due to the
viscous heating are investigated with changing the values of thermal
conductivity of the polymeric liquid. It is found that at a small applied shear
stress on the plate, the temperature of polymeric liquid only slightly
increases in inverse proportion to the thermal conductivity and the apparent
viscosity of polymeric liquid is not much affected by changing the thermal
conductivity. However, at a large shear stress, the transitional behaviors of
the polymeric liquid occur due to the interplay of the shear deformation and
viscous heating by changing the thermal conductivity. This transition is
characterized by the Nahme-Griffith number $Na$ which is defined as the ratio
of the viscous heating to the thermal conduction at a characteristic
temperature. When the Nahme-Griffith number exceeds the unity, the temperature
of polymeric liquid increases rapidly and the apparent viscosity also
exponentially decreases as the thermal conductivity decreases. The conformation
of polymer chains is stretched and aligned by the shear flow for $Na<1$, but
the coherent structure becomes disturbed by the thermal motion of molecules for
$Na>1$.

Based on the analysis, we then propose a multi-criteria charging control policy
that optimizes the transmit power allocation over frequency by jointly
considering the channel state information (CSI) and the battery state
information (BSI) of wireless devices. For practical implementation, the
proposed scheme is realized by a novel limited CSI estimation mechanism
embedded with partial BSI, which significantly reduces the energy cost of CSI

significantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power

much attention in theoretical physics and rigorous mathematical physics. A
peculiar point of interest is the question of coincidence of the quenched and
annealed critical point for a small amount of disorder. The question has been
mathematically settled in most cases in the last few years, giving in
particular a rigorous validation of the Harris Criterion on disorder relevance.
However, the marginal case, where the return probability exponent is equal to
$1/2$, i.e. where the inter-arrival law of the renewal process is given by
$K(n)=n^{-3/2}\phi(n)$ where $\phi$ is a slowly varying function, has been left
partially open. In this paper, we give a complete answer to the question by
proving a simple necessary and sufficient criterion on the return probability
for disorder relevance, which confirms earlier predictions from the literature.
Moreover, we also provide sharp asymptotics on the critical point shift: in the
case of the pinning (or wetting) of a one dimensional simple random walk, the
shift of the critical point satisfies the following high temperature
asymptotics $$
  \lim_{\beta\rightarrow 0}\beta^2\log h_c(\beta)= - \frac{\pi}{2}. $$ This
gives a rigorous proof to a claim of B. Derrida, V. Hakim and J. Vannimenus

crucial importance for example to predict aircraft trajectories evolving in an

uncertainty provided by the environment parameters leads us to also consider
interacting particles on the parameter space. This novel algorithm is described
in this paper. It allows to approximate both a random environment and a
stochastic process evolving in this environment, given noisy observations of
the process. It is a sequential algorithm that generalizes island particle
models including a parameter. It is referred by us as labeled island particle
algorithm. We prove the convergence of the labeled island particle algorithm
and we establish $\mathbb{L}^p$ bound as well as time uniform $\mathbb{L}^p$
bound for the asymptotic error introduced by this double level of

the sensitivity of a general detector in an isothermal galactic dark matter

detector without head-tail information with 6.3 times the statistics is found
to achieve the same performance level as a full three-dimensional tracking dark
matter detector. Optimum operation orientations are obtained for various
experimental configurations, with detectors that are space- or Earth-fixed,
have head-tail capability or not, and use energy information or not.
Earth-fixed detectors are found to have best sensitivity when the polar axis is
oriented at a 45 degree angle from the Earth's pole. With background
contamination that mimics the WIMP signal's energy distribution, the
performance is found to decrease at a rate less than the decrease of signal
purity. The WIMP-mass dependence of the performance of a detector with various
energy thresholds that uses gaseous xenon as target material is reported. We
find that with a $5\times 10^{-46} \mathrm{cm}^2$ spin-independent WIMP-nucleon

estimating the probability of some sequence of tasks occurring in a business

Networks are able to automatically learn these probabilities through mechanisms

model makes it more adequate. But there is virtually no methods of coordinated
(depended on structure of the system) stochastic introduction into
deterministic models. Authors have improved the method of stochastic models
construction for the class of one-step processes and illustrated by models of
population dynamics. Population dynamics was chosen for study because its
deterministic models were sufficiently well explored that allows to compare the
results with already known ones.
  Purpose. To optimize the models creation as much as possible some routine
operations should be automated. In this case, the process of drawing up the
model equations can be algorithmized and implemented in the computer algebra
system. Furthermore, on the basis of these results a set of programs for
numerical experiment can be obtained.
  Method. The computer algebra system Axiom is used for analytical calculations
implementation. To perform the numerical experiment FORTRAN and Julia languages
are used. The method Runge--Kutta method for stochastic differential equations
is used as numerical method.
  Results. The program compex for creating stochastic one-step processes models
is constructed. Its application is illustrated by the predator-prey population
dynamic system.
  Conclusions. Computer algebra systems are very convenient for the purposes of
rapid prototyping in mathematical models design and analysis.

largest planetesimals of a population with a characteristic radius of 100 km
undergo run-away accretion of chondrules within ~3 Myr, forming planetary
embryos up to Mars sizes along with smaller asteroids whose size distribution
matches that of main belt asteroids. The aerodynamical accretion leads to
size-sorting of chondrules consistent with chondrites. Accretion of mm-sized
chondrules and ice particles drives the growth of planetesimals beyond the ice
line as well, but the growth time increases above the disk life time outside of
25 AU. The contribution of direct planetesimal accretion to the growth of both
asteroids and Kuiper belt objects is minor. In contrast, planetesimal accretion
and chondrule accretion play more equal roles for the formation of Moon-sized
embryos in the terrestrial planet formation region. These embryos are isolated
from each other and accrete planetesimals only at a low rate. However, the
continued accretion of chondrules destabilizes the oligarchic configuration and
leads to the formation of Mars-sized embryos and terrestrial planets by a
combination of direct chondrule accretion and giant impacts.

extension and Schur coupling was settled for the Hilbert space case, by showing
that equivalence after extension implies equivalence after one-sided extension.
In this paper we investigate consequences of equivalence after extension for
compact Banach space operators. We show that generating the same operator ideal
is necessary but not sufficient for two compact operators to be equivalent
after extension. In analogy with the necessary and sufficient conditions on the
singular values for compact Hilbert space operators that are equivalent after
extension, we prove the necessity of similar relationships between the
$s$-numbers of two compact Banach space operators that are equivalent after
extension, for arbitrary $s$-functions.
  We investigate equivalence after extension for operators on
$\ell^{p}$-spaces. We show that two operators that act on different
$\ell^{p}$-spaces cannot be equivalent after one-sided extension. Such
operators can still be equivalent after extension, for instance all invertible
operators are equivalent after extension, however, if one of the two operators
is compact, then they cannot be equivalent after extension. This contrasts the
Hilbert space case where equivalence after one-sided extension and equivalence
after extension are, in fact, identical relations.
  Finally, for general Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, we investigate consequences
of an operator on $X$ being equivalent after extension to a compact operator on
$Y$. We show that, in this case, a closed finite codimensional subspace of $Y$
must embed into $X$, and that certain general Banach space properties must
transfer from $X$ to $Y$. We also show that no operator on $X$ can be
equivalent after extension to an operator on $Y$, if $X$ and $Y$ are

the coupled exciton-photon system realised in a specific regime of pumping to
the exciton state and depletion of the reservoir. For effective non-zero

curving back to the jet axis, as seen in pulsed jet simulations. Two of them
are reasonably resolved, showing kinematics consistent with sideways ejection,

$\ell$-link of $G$ is a walk of length $\ell$ in which consecutive edges are
different. We identify an $\ell$-link with its reverse sequence. The
$\ell$-link graph $\mathbb{L}_\ell(G)$ of $G$ is defined to have vertices the
$\ell$-links of $G$, such that two vertices of $\mathbb{L}_\ell(G)$ are
adjacent if their corresponding $\ell$-links are the initial and final
subsequences of an $(\ell + 1)$-link of $G$. A graph $G$ is called an
$\ell$-root of a graph $H$ if $\mathbb{L}_\ell(G) \cong H$. For example,
$\mathbb{L}_0(G) \cong G$. And the $1$-link graph of a simple graph is the line
graph of that graph. Moreover, let $H$ be a finite connected simple graph.
Whitney's isomorphism theorem (1932) states if $H$ has two connected nonnull
simple $1$-roots, then $H \cong K_3$, and the two $1$-roots are isomorphic to
$K_3$ and $K_{1, 3}$ respectively.
  This paper investigates the $\ell$-roots of finite graphs. We show that every
$\ell$-root is a certain combination of a finite minimal $\ell$-root and trees
of bounded diameter. This transfers the study of $\ell$-roots into that of
finite minimal $\ell$-roots. As a qualitative generalisation of Whitney's
isomorphism theorem, we bound from above the number, size, order and maximum
degree of minimal $\ell$-roots of a finite graph. This work forms the basis for
solving the recognition and determination problems for $\ell$-link graphs in
our future papers. As a byproduct, we characterise the $\ell$-roots of some
special graphs including cycles.
  Similar results are obtained for path graphs introduced by Broersma and Hoede
(1989). $G$ is an $\ell$-path root of a graph $H$ if $H$ is isomorphic to the
$\ell$-path graph of $G$. We bound from above the number, size and order of
minimal $\ell$-path roots of a finite graph.

numbers of a spinning compact star, here we extend powerful perturbative
techniques to compute the exterior geometry of a spinning object distorted by

of the object introduces couplings between electric and magnetic deformations
and new classes of induced Love numbers emerge. For example, a spinning object

equations which, remarkably, can be solved analytically in vacuum. We discuss
certain subtleties in defining the multipole moments of the central object,
which are due to the difficulty in separating the tidal field from the linear
response of the object in the solution. By extending the standard procedure to
identify the linear response in the static case, we prove analytically that the
Love numbers of a Kerr black hole remain zero to second order in the spin. As a

a perturbation of a background metric that describes the external geometry of
an isolated, slowly rotating body. The tidal environment is generic and
characterized by two symmetric-tracefree tidal moments E_{ab} and B_{ab}, and
the body is characterized by its mass M, its radius R, and a dimensionless
angular-momentum vector \chi^a << 1. The perturbation accounts for all
couplings between \chi^a and the tidal moments. The body's gravitational
response to the applied tidal field is measured in part by the familiar
gravitational Love numbers K^{el}_2 and K^{mag}_2, but we find that the
coupling between the body's rotation and the tidal environment requires the
introduction of four new quantities, which we designate as rotational-tidal

where two transmitters aim to communicate independent messages to two different
receivers via a common channel. One source, referred to as the cognitive, is
capable of overhearing the other source, referred to as the primary, through a
noisy in-band link and thus can assist in sending the primary's data. Two novel
outer bounds of the type $2R_p+R_c$ and $R_p+2R_c$ are derived for the class of
injective semi-deterministic CCICs where the noises at the different
source-destination pairs are independent. An achievable rate region is derived
based on Gelfand-Pinsker binning, superposition coding and simultaneous
decoding at the receivers.
  The lower and outer bounds are then specialized to the practically relevant
Gaussian noise case. The authors of this paper recently characterized to within
a constant gap the capacity of the symmetric Gaussian CCIC in (a) the strong
interference regime, and (b) for a subset of the weak interference regime when
the cooperation link is larger than a given threshold. This work characterizes
to within a constant gap the capacity for the symmetric Gaussian CCIC in the
regime that was still open. In particular, it is shown that the novel outer
bounds are necessary to characterize the capacity to within a constant gap when
the cooperation link is weaker than the direct links, that is, in this regime
unilateral cooperation leaves some system resources underutilized.

not only by that user's investment in security measures, but also by the
positive externality of the security decisions of (some of) the other users.
The provision of security in such system is therefore modeled as a public good
provision problem, and is referred to as a security game. In this paper, we
compare two well-known incentive mechanisms in this context for incentivizing
optimal security investments among users, namely the Pivotal and the
Externality mechanisms. The taxes in a Pivotal mechanism are designed to ensure
users' voluntary participation, while those in an Externality mechanism are
devised to maintain a balanced budget. We first show the more general result
that, due to the non-excludable nature of security, no mechanism can
incentivize the socially optimal investment profile, while at the same time
ensuring voluntary participation and maintaining a balanced budget for all
instances of security games. To further illustrate, we apply the Pivotal and
Externality mechanisms to the special case of weighted total effort
interdependence models, and identify some of the effects of varying
interdependency between users on the budget deficit in the Pivotal mechanism,

Twitter, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio that both end users and data
mining applications observe. Existing techniques on social spam detection have
focused primarily on the identification of spam accounts by using extensive
historical and network-based data. In this paper we focus on the detection of
spam tweets, which optimises the amount of data that needs to be gathered by
relying only on tweet-inherent features. This enables the application of the
spam detection system to a large set of tweets in a timely fashion, potentially
applicable in a real-time or near real-time setting. Using two large
hand-labelled datasets of tweets containing spam, we study the suitability of
five classification algorithms and four different feature sets to the social
spam detection task. Our results show that, by using the limited set of
features readily available in a tweet, we can achieve encouraging results which
are competitive when compared against existing spammer detection systems that
make use of additional, costly user features. Our study is the first that
attempts at generalising conclusions on the optimal classifiers and sets of
features for social spam detection over different datasets.

two different atoms in the unit cell repeated over the lattice; (ii) an
extended Coulomb-like matrix that takes into account a number of neighboring
unit cells; and (iii) an Ansatz that mimics the periodicity and the basic
features of the elements in the Ewald sum matrix by using a sine function of
the crystal coordinates of the atoms. The representations are compared for a
Laplacian kernel with Manhattan norm, trained to reproduce formation energies
using a data set of 3938 crystal structures obtained from the Materials

error in predicting formation energies of new structures corresponds to (i)
0.49, (ii) 0.64, and (iii) 0.37 eV/atom for the respective representations.

data are drawn from hidden spaces that are graph-like, such as the cosmic web.
A metric graph offers one of the simplest yet still meaningful ways to
represent the non-linear structure hidden behind the data. In this paper, we
propose a new distance between two finite metric graphs, called the
persistence-distortion distance, which draws upon a topological idea. This
topological perspective along with the metric space viewpoint provide a new
angle to the graph matching problem. Our persistence-distortion distance has
two properties not shared by previous methods: First, it is stable against the
perturbations of the input graph metrics. Second, it is a continuous distance
measure, in the sense that it is defined on an alignment of the underlying
spaces of input graphs, instead of merely their nodes. This makes our
persistence-distortion distance robust against, for example, different
discretizations of the same underlying graph. Despite considering the input
graphs as continuous spaces, that is, taking all points into account, we show
that we can compute the persistence-distortion distance in polynomial time. The
time complexity for the discrete case where only graph nodes are considered is
much faster. We also provide some preliminary experimental results to
demonstrate the use of the new distance measure.

the effect is greatest when there is a near-degeneracy between the initial

the total surgery obstruction by Ranicki, as described in \cite{Ra79}. The

relativity seem to be unable to explain gravitational behavior of large
structure of the universe. The assumption of dark matter solves this problem
without modifying theories. But it implies that most of the matter in the
universe must be unobserved matter. Another solution is to modify gravitation
laws. In this article, we study a third way that doesn't modify gravitation
neither matter's distribution, by using a new physical assumption on the
clusters. Compare with Newtonian gravitation, general relativity (in its
linearized approximation) leads to add a new component without changing the
gravity field. As already known, this component for galaxies is too small to
explain dark matter. But we will see that the galaxies' clusters can generate a
significant component and embed large structure of universe. We show that the
magnitude of this embedding component is small enough to be in agreement with
current experimental results, undetectable at our scale, but detectable at the
scale of the galaxies and explain dark matter, in particular the rotation speed
of galaxies, the rotation speed of dwarf satellite galaxies, the expected
quantity of dark matter inside galaxies and the expected experimental values of
parameters $\Omega$\_dm of dark matter measured in CMB. This solution implies
testable consequences that differentiate it from other theories: decreasing
dark matter with the distance to the cluster's center, large quantity of dark
matter for galaxies close to the cluster's center, isolation of galaxies
without dark matter, movement of dwarf satellite galaxies in planes close to
the supergalactic plane, close orientations of spin's vectors of two close
clusters, orientation of nearly all the spin's vector of galaxies of a same
cluster in a same half-space, existence of very rare galaxies with two portions
of their disk that rotate in opposite directions...

long evolution, it had important contributions from alchemist, was transformed
by Ramon Llull and apparently ended with Giordano Bruno, who was considered the
best known representative of this art. This tradition did not disappear, but
lives in the formulations of our modern scientific theories. From its initial
form as a method of keeping information via associations, it became a principle
of classification and structuring of knowledge. This principle, which we here
name {\it differentiation with stratification}, is a structural design behind
classical mechanics. Integrating two different traditions of science in one
structure, this physical theory became the modern paradigm of science.
  In this paper, we show that this principle can also be formulated as a set of
questions. This is done via an analysis of theories, based on the epistemology
of observational realism. A combination of Rudolph Carnap's concept of theory
as a system of observational and theoretical languages, with a criterion for
separating observational languages, based on analytical psychology, shapes this
epistemology. The `nuclear' role of the observational laws and the
differentiations from these nucleus, reproducing the general cases of
phenomena, reveals the memory art's heritage in the theories. Here in this
paper we argue that this design is also present in special relativity and in
quantum mechanics.
