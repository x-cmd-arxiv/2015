description of epitaxial growth processes. This is a parabolic equation whose
evolution is governed by the competition between the determinant of the Hessian
matrix of the solution and the biharmonic operator. This model might present a
gradient flow structure depending on the boundary conditions. We first extend
previous results on the existence of stationary solutions to this model for
Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the evolution problem we prove local
existence of solutions for arbitrary data and global existence of solutions for
small data. By exploiting the boundary conditions and the variational structure
of the equation, according to the size of the data we prove finite time blow-up
of the solution and/or convergence to a stationary solution for global
solutions.

redistribution due to frequency-chirping TAE in the range 50 kHz to 100 kHz,
and frequency-chirping energetic particle modes known as fishbones in the range
20 kHz to 50 kHz, is observed. TAE and fishbones are also observed to cause
losses of fast ions from the plasma. The spatial and temporal evolution of the
fast-ion distribution is determined using a fission chamber, a
radially-scanning collimated neutron flux monitor, a fast-ion deuterium alpha
spectrometer and a charged fusion product detector. Modelling using the global
transport analysis code TRANSP, with ad hoc anomalous diffusion and fishbone
loss models introduced, reproduces the coarsest features of the affected
fast-ion distribution in the presence of energetic-particle-driven modes. The
spectrally and spatially resolved measurements show however that these models
do not fully capture the effects of chirping modes on the fast-ion
distribution.

  Srivastava","Video-Based Action Recognition Using Rate-Invariant Analysis of
  Covariance Trajectories",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical classification of actions in videos is mostly performed by
extracting relevant features, particularly covariance features, from image
frames and studying time series associated with temporal evolutions of these
features. A natural mathematical representation of activity videos is in form
of parameterized trajectories on the covariance manifold, i.e. the set of
symmetric, positive-definite matrices (SPDMs). The variable execution-rates of
actions implies variable parameterizations of the resulting trajectories, and
complicates their classification. Since action classes are invariant to
execution rates, one requires rate-invariant metrics for comparing
trajectories. A recent paper represented trajectories using their transported
square-root vector fields (TSRVFs), defined by parallel translating
scaled-velocity vectors of trajectories to a reference tangent space on the
manifold. To avoid arbitrariness of selecting the reference and to reduce
distortion introduced during this mapping, we develop a purely intrinsic
approach where SPDM trajectories are represented by redefining their TSRVFs at
the starting points of the trajectories, and analyzed as elements of a vector
bundle on the manifold. Using a natural Riemannain metric on vector bundles of
SPDMs, we compute geodesic paths and geodesic distances between trajectories in
the quotient space of this vector bundle, with respect to the
re-parameterization group. This makes the resulting comparison of trajectories
invariant to their re-parameterization. We demonstrate this framework on two
applications involving video classification: visual speech recognition or
lip-reading and hand-gesture recognition. In both cases we achieve results
either comparable to or better than the current literature.

modifies the fiber dispersion, allowing phase-matched access to dispersive
waves at otherwise inaccessible frequencies, well into the mid-IR. Remarkably,
the pulses generated turn out to have durations of the order of two optical
cycles. In addition, this ultrafast emission, which occurs even in the absence

a wide frequency range simply by adjusting the gas pressure. These theoretical
results pave the way to a new generation of compact, fiber-based sources of

expectation, in mean square, and almost surely are equivalent for a general
random network model when the inter-sampling interval and network size satisfy
a simple relation. The three types of consensus are shown to be simultaneously
achieved over an independent or a Markovian random network defined on an
underlying graph with a directed spanning tree. For both independent and
Markovian random network models, necessary and sufficient conditions for
mean-square consensus are derived in terms of the spectral radius of the
corresponding state transition matrix. These conditions are then interpreted as
the existence of critical value on the inter-sampling interval, below which
global mean-square consensus is achieved and above which the system diverges in
mean-square sense for some initial states. Finally, we establish an upper bound
on the inter-sampling interval below which almost sure consensus is reached,

divergence is reached. Some numerical simulations are given to validate the

target material in a hadronic scenario for gamma-ray production (cosmic rays
interacting with gas) and an understanding of the dynamics. Furthermore, the
effects of cosmic ray diffusion into dense gas may alter the gamma-ray spectrum
to cause a flattening of spectra towards such regions. Dense molecular gas mass
at a level of ~10^5 Mo was revealed in this survey, with mass of the order of
~10^3 Mo towards HESSJ1729-345 in each coincident Galactic arm, but no
significant detection of dense molecular gas towards HESSJ1731-347 at the
currently-preferred distance of ~5.2-6.2 kpc was discovered.

concentration-polarization (CP) layer in this process is determined by
advective-diffusive dispersion transport and the interplay of applied and
osmotic transmembrane pressure contributions. The UF performance is thus
strongly dependent on the membrane properties, the hydrodynamic structure of
the Brownian particles, their direct and hydrodynamic interactions, and the
boundary conditions. We present a macroscopic description of cross-flow UF of
non-ionic microgels modeled as solvent-permeable spheres. Our filtration model
involves recently derived semi-analytic expressions for the
concentration-dependent collective diffusion coefficient and viscosity of
permeable particle dispersions [Riest et al., Soft Matter, 2015, 11, 2821].
These expressions have been well tested against computer simulation and
experimental results. We analyze the CP layer properties and the permeate flux
at different operating conditions and discuss various filtration process
efficiency and cost indicators. Our results show that the proper specification
of the concentration-dependent transport coefficients is important for reliable
filtration process predictions. We also show that the solvent permeability of
microgels is an essential ingredient to the UF modeling. The particle
permeability lowers the particle concentration at the membrane surface, thus
increasing the permeate flux.

maximum total kinetic energy as a function of mass and charge of fragments from
thermal neutron induced fission of 235U. Assuming spherical fragments at
scission, the Coulomb interaction energy between fragments (C_sph) is higher
than the Q-value, the available energy. Therefore at scission the fragments
must be deformed, so that the Coulomb interaction energy does not exceed the
Q-value. The fact that the even-odd effects in the maximum total kinetic energy
as a function of the charge and mass, respectively, are lower than the even-odd
effects of Q is consistent with the assumption that odd mass fragments are
softer than the even-even fragments. Even-odd effects of charge distribution in
super asymmetric fragmentation also are interpreted with the Coulomb effect
hypothesis. Because the difference between C_sph and Q increases with
asymmetry, fragmentations require higher total deformation energy to occur.
Higher deformation energy of the fragments implies lower free energy to break
pairs of nucleons. This explains why in the asymmetric fragmentation region,
the even-odd effects of the distribution of proton number and neutron number
increases with asymmetry. Based on a similar reasoning, a prediction of a
relatively high even-odd effect in symmetric fragmentations is proposed.

heterostructures, known as van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, is an essential degree
of freedom for tuning their properties on demand. Few-layer black phosphorus
(FLBP), a material with high potential for nano- and optoelectronics
applications, appears to have interlayer couplings much stronger than graphene
and other 2D systems. Indeed, these couplings call into question whether the
stacking of FLBP can be governed only by vdW interactions, which is of crucial
importance for epitaxy and property refinement. Here, we perform a theoretical
investigation of the vibrational properties of FLBP, which reflect directly its
interlayer coupling, by discussing six Raman-observable phonons, including
three optical, one breathing, and two shear modes. With increasing sample
thickness, we find anomalous redshifts of the frequencies for each optical mode
but a blueshift for the armchair shear mode. Our calculations also show
splitting of the phonon branches, due to anomalous surface phenomena, and
strong phonon-phonon coupling. By computing uniaxial stress effects,
inter-atomic force constants, and electron densities, we provide a compelling
demonstration that these properties are the consequence of strong and highly
directional interlayer interactions arising from electronic hybridization of
the lone electron-pairs of FLBP, rather than from vdW interactions. This
exceptional interlayer coupling mechanism controls the stacking stability of BP
layers and thus opens a new avenue beyond vdW epitaxy for understanding the
design of 2D heterostructures.

multilayer graphene and heterostructures where graphene is encapsulated by
trivial insulators with a strong spin-orbit coupling. We use a four orbital
tight-binding model that includes the full atomic spin-orbit coupling and we
calculate the $Z_{2}$ topological invariant of the bulk states as well as the
edge states of semi-infinite crystals with armchair termination. For
homogeneous multilayers we find that even when the spin-orbit interaction opens
a gap for all the possible stackings, only those with odd number of layers host
gapless edge states while those with even number of layers are trivial
insulators. For the heterostructures where graphene is encapsulated by trivial
insulators, it turns out that the interlayer coupling is able to induce a
topological gap whose size is controlled by the spin-orbit coupling of the
encapsulating materials, indicating that the quantum spin Hall phase can be
induced by proximity to trivial insulators.

blueward of the He II Lya wavelength 304 (1+z) A, is one of the most important
spectral features in the study of the intergalactic medium. Based on the HST
spectra of 24 He II quasars, we find that the majority of them display a
proximity profile, corresponding to an ionization radius as large as 20 Mpc in
the source's rest frame. In comparison with those in the H i spectra of the
quasars at z~6, the He II proximity effect is more prominent and is observed
over a considerably longer period of reionization. The He II proximity zone
sizes decrease at higher redshifts, particularly at z > 3.3. This trend is
similar to that for H I, signaling an onset of He II reionization at z~4.
  For quasar SDSS1253+6817 (z=3.48), the He II absorption trough displays a
gradual decline and serves a good case for modeling the He II reionization. To
model such a broad profile requires a quasar radiation field whose distribution
between 4 and 1 Rydberg is considerably harder than normally assumed. The UV
continuum of this quasar is indeed exceptionally steep, and the He II
ionization level in the quasar vicinity is higher than the average level in the
intergalactic medium. These results are evidence that a very hard EUV continuum
from this quasar produces a large ionized zone around it.
  Distinct exceptions are the two brightest He II quasars at z~2.8, for which
no significant proximity profile is present, possibly implying that they are
young.

asteroseismology has become a reality with the advent of large time domain

improved constraints on stellar rotation and activity, over and above that
obtained via traditional techniques such as spectropolarimetry or CaII H&K

provided a wide parameter space to confront theories of stellar magnetism.
These new empirical databases are complemented by theoretical advances and

signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) better than 0.01\% across individual line
profiles, are becoming common with larger aperture telescopes.
Spectropolarimetric studies require high SNR observations and are often limited
by instrument systematic errors. As an example, fiber-fed spectropolarimeters
combined with advanced line-combination algorithms can reach statistical error
limits of 0.001\% in measurements of spectral line profiles referenced to the
continuum. Calibration of such observations is often required both for
cross-talk and for continuum polarization. This is not straightforward since
telescope cross-talk errors are rarely less than $\sim$1\%. In solar
instruments like the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), much more
stringent calibration is required and the telescope optical design contains
substantial intrinsic polarization artifacts. This paper describes some
generally useful techniques we have applied to the HiVIS spectropolarimeter at
the 3.7m AEOS telescope on Haleakala. HiVIS now yields accurate polarized
spectral line profiles that are shot-noise limited to 0.01\% SNR levels at our
full spectral resolution of 10,000 at spectral sampling of $\sim$100,000. We
show line profiles with absolute spectropolarimetric calibration for cross-talk
and continuum polarization in a system with polarization cross-talk levels of
essentially 100\%. In these data the continuum polarization can be recovered to
one percent accuracy because of synchronized charge-shuffling model now working
with our CCD detector. These techniques can be applied to other
spectropolarimeters on other telescopes for both night and day-time
applications such as DKIST, TMT and ELT which have folded non-axially symmetric

inflated EnKF can efficiently sample this marginal, and argue that the marginal
posterior is often the more useful pdf in geophysics. This explains the wide
applicability of EnKF in this field. We further investigate the typical tuning
of EnKF, in which one attempts to match the mean square error (MSE) to the
marginal posterior variance, and show that sampling error may be huge, even if

systems. Despite this variety, each of these systems undergoes a general
process of online social network assembly, which represents the complicated and
heterogeneous changes that transform newly born systems into mature platforms.
However, little is known about this process. For example, how much of a
network's assembly is driven by simple growth? How does a network's structure
change as it matures? How does network structure vary with adoption rates and
user heterogeneity, and do these properties play different roles at different
points in the assembly? We investigate these and other questions using a unique
dataset of online connections among the roughly one million users at the first
100 colleges admitted to Facebook, captured just 20 months after its launch. We
first show that different vintages and adoption rates across this population of
networks reveal temporal dynamics of the assembly process, and that assembly is
only loosely related to network growth. We then exploit natural experiments
embedded in this dataset and complementary data obtained via Internet
archaeology to show that different subnetworks matured at different rates
toward similar end states. These results shed light on the processes and
patterns of online social network assembly, and may facilitate more effective
design for online social systems.

From the solar perspective, the distance distribution of particles is
double-peaked in fields passing through the X-shape. The separation and
amplitude ratio between the two peaks qualitatively match the observed trends
towards the Galactic bulge. We confirm clear signatures of cylindrical rotation
in the pattern of mean radial velocity across the bar/bulge region. We also
find possible imprints of coherent orbital motion inside the bar structure in
the radial velocity distribution along l=0 degree, where the near and far sides
of the bar/bulge show excesses of approaching and receding particles. The
coherent orbital motion is also reflected in the slight displacement of the
zero-velocity-line in the mean radial velocity, and the displacement of the
maximum/minimum in the mean longitudinal proper motion across the bulge region.
We find some degree of anisotropy in the stellar velocity within the X-shape,
but the underlying orbital family of the X-shape cannot be clearly
distinguished. Two potential applications of the X-shape in previous literature
are tested, i.e., bulge rotation and Galactic center measurements. We find that
the proper motion difference between the two sides of the X-shape can be used
to estimate the mean azimuthal streaming motion of the bulge, but not the
pattern speed of the bar. We also demonstrate that the Galactic center can be
located with the X-shape, but the accuracy depends on the fitting scheme, the
number of fields, and their latitudinal coverage.

measurements. Photoplethysmographic imaging (PPGI) has been recently proposed
as a non-contact monitoring alternative by measuring blood pulse signals across
a spatial region of interest. Existing systems operate in reflectance mode, of
which many are limited to short-distance monitoring and are prone to temporal
changes in ambient illumination. This paper is the first study to investigate
the feasibility of long-distance non-contact cardiovascular monitoring at the
supermeter level using transmittance PPGI. For this purpose, a novel PPGI
system was designed at the hardware and software level using ambient correction
via temporally coded illumination (TCI) and signal processing for PPGI signal
extraction. Experimental results show that the processing steps yield a
substantially more pulsatile PPGI signal than the raw acquired signal,
resulting in statistically significant increases in correlation to ground-truth
PPG in both short- ($p \in [<0.0001, 0.040]$) and long-distance ($p \in
[<0.0001, 0.056]$) monitoring. The results support the hypothesis that
long-distance heart rate monitoring is feasible using transmittance PPGI,
allowing for new possibilities of monitoring cardiovascular function in a
non-contact manner.

This contrasts strongly with comparatively isolated dwarf galaxies, which are

determine the typical timescales over which environmental processes within the
MW/M31 halos remove gas and quench star formation in low-mass satellite
galaxies. The quenching timescales for satellites with M_star < 10^8 M_sun are
short, < 2 Gyr, and quenching is more rapid at lower M_star. These satellite
quenching timescales can be 1 - 2 Gyr longer if one includes the time that
satellites were environmentally preprocessed by low-mass groups prior to MW/M31
infall. We compare with quenching timescales for more massive satellites from

The simulations are designed to track the cloud center of mass, enabling us to
study the cloud evolution at long disruption times. For supersonic flows, a
Mach cone forms around the cloud, which damps the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
but also establishes a streamwise pressure gradient that stretches the cloud
apart. If time is expressed in units of the cloud crushing time, both the cloud
lifetime and the cloud acceleration rate are independent of cloud radius, and
we find simple scalings for these quantities as a function of the Mach number
of the external medium. A resolution study suggests that our simulations have
sufficient resolution to accurately describe the evolution of cold clouds in
the absence of thermal conduction and magnetic fields, physical processes whose
roles will be studied in forthcoming papers.

Assuming that this dichotomy is driven by environmental quenching, we use the
ELVIS suite of N-body simulations to constrain the characteristic timescale
upon which satellites must quench following infall into the virial volumes of
their hosts. The high satellite quenched fraction observed in the Local Group
demands an extremely short quenching timescale (~ 2 Gyr) for dwarf satellites
in the mass range Mstar ~ 10^6-10^8 Msun. This quenching timescale is
significantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction of
more massive satellites (~ 8 Gyr), both in the Local Group and in more massive
host halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenching
mechanism at Mstar < 10^8 Msun. Combining our work with the results of
complementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression of
star formation in massive satellites (Mstar ~ 10^8 - 10^11 Msun) is broadly
consistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenching
timescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time. Below a critical stellar
mass scale of ~ 10^8 Msun, however, the required quenching times are much
shorter than the expected cold gas depletion times. Instead, quenching must act
on a timescale comparable to the dynamical time of the host halo. We posit that
ram-pressure stripping can naturally explain this behavior, with the critical
mass (of Mstar ~ 10^8 Msun) corresponding to halos with gravitational restoring
forces that are too weak to overcome the drag force encountered when moving
through an extended, hot circumgalactic medium.

show that a particle ring spreads from physical collisions and collective
gravitational scattering, similar to migration. Around a binary, these
processes take place in the reference frames of ""most circular"" orbits, akin to
circular ones in a Keplerian potential. Ring particles damp to these orbits and
avoid destructive collisions. Damping and diffusion also help particles survive
dynamical instabilities driven by resonances with the binary. In some
situations, particles become trapped near resonances that sweep outward with
the tidal evolution of the Pluto-Charon binary. With simple models and
numerical experiments, we show how the Pluto-Charon impact ring may have
expanded into a broad disk, out of which grew the circumbinary moons. In some

angular-momentum transfer within the circumbinary disc, the spin-alignment
process is driven by the mass accreting on to each black hole. Mass transfer
between different disc components thus couples the inspiral and the alignment
process together. Mass is expected to leak through the cavity cleared by the

and the edge of a finite system: While the bulk has a non-zero energy gap, the
edges are forced to sustain excitations traversing these gaps. Originally
proposed for electrons governed by quantum mechanics, it has remained an
important open question if the same physics can be observed for systems obeying
Newton's equations of motion. Here, we report on measurements that characterize
the collective behavior of mechanical oscillators exhibiting the phenomenology
of the quantum spin hall effect. The phononic edge modes are shown to be
helical and we demonstrate their topological protection via the stability
against imperfections. Our results open the door to the design of topological

and operation of power systems. Due to the non-linear nature of the AC
power-flow equations, the OPF problem is known to be non-convex, therefore hard
to solve. Most proposed methods for solving the OPF rely on approximations that
render the problem convex, but that may yield inexact solutions. Recently,
Farivar and Low proposed a method that is claimed to be exact for radial
distribution systems, despite no apparent approximations. In our work, we show
that it is, in fact, not exact. On one hand, there is a misinterpretation of
the physical network model related to the ampacity constraint of the lines'
current flows. On the other hand, the proof of the exactness of the proposed
relaxation requires unrealistic assumptions related to the unboundedness of
specific control variables. We also show that the extension of this approach to
account for exact line models might provide physically infeasible solutions.
Recently, several contributions have proposed OPF algorithms that rely on the
use of the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, as we
show in this work, there are cases for which the ADMM-based solution of the
non-relaxed OPF problem fails to converge. To overcome the aforementioned
limitations, we propose an algorithm for the solution of a non-approximated,
non-convex OPF problem in radial distribution systems that is based on the
method of multipliers, and on a primal decomposition of the OPF. This work is
divided in two parts. In Part I, we specifically discuss the limitations of BFM
and ADMM to solve the OPF problem. In Part II, we provide a centralized version
and a distributed asynchronous version of the proposed OPF algorithm and we
evaluate its performances using both small-scale electrical networks, as well
as a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder.

0+I (embedded protostars) of 0.54 Myr. We find significant correlations of
HCO$^{+}$ integrated intensity with ${\alpha}$ and $T_{bol}$ but not with

average, a factor of ~2 higher $T_{bol}$ and a factor of ~5 lower $L_{bol}$

the number of undetected YSOs divided by the total number surveyed, for sources

the cylinders are assumed to be of infinite length or periodic in the axial

turbulence in such flows by using both periodic and no-slip boundary conditions
in the axial direction. We obtain a simple linear criterion that determines
whether the infinite-cylinder assumption can be employed. The curvature of the
cylinders enters this linear relationship through the slope and additive
constant. For a given length-to-gap aspect ratio there is a critical Rayleigh
number beyond which the laminar flow in the finite system is convective and so
the behaviour is entirely different from the periodic case. The criterion does
not depend on the Prandtl number and appears quite robust with respect to the
Reynolds number. In particular, it continues to work reasonably in the
turbulent regime.

prevents the formation of protostellar discs. This condition is subordinate to
the ionisation fraction characterising the inmost parts of a collapsing cloud.
The ionisation level is established by the number and the energy of the cosmic
rays able to reach these regions. Adopting the method developed in our previous
studies, we computed how cosmic rays are attenuated as a function of column
density and magnetic field strength. We applied our formalism to low- and
high-mass star formation models obtained by numerical simulations of
gravitational collapse that include rotation and turbulence. In general, we
found that the decoupling between gas and magnetic fields, condition allowing
the collapse to go ahead, occurs only when the cosmic-ray attenuation is taken
into account with respect to a calculation in which the cosmic-ray ionisation
rate is kept constant. We also found that the extent of the decoupling zone
also depends on the dust grain size distribution and is larger if large grains
(of radius about 0.1 microns) are formed by compression and coagulation during
cloud collapse. The decoupling region disappears for the high-mass case due to
magnetic field diffusion that is caused by turbulence and that is not included
in the low-mass models. We infer that a simultaneous study of the cosmic-ray
propagation during the cloud's collapse may lead to values of the gas
resistivity in the innermost few hundred AU around a forming protostar that is
higher than generally assumed.

the matter fluctuations. Its unbiased and optimal estimation is therefore of
great importance. In this paper we generalise the framework of Feldman et al.
(1994) to take into account the fact that galaxies are not simply a Poisson
sampling of the underlying dark matter distribution. Besides finite
survey-volume effects and flux-limits, our optimal estimation scheme
incorporates several of the key tenets of galaxy formation: galaxies form and
reside exclusively in dark matter haloes; a given dark matter halo may host
several galaxies of various luminosities; galaxies inherit part of their
large-scale bias from their host halo. Under these broad assumptions, we prove
that the optimal weights ""do not"" explicitly depend on galaxy luminosity, other
than through defining the maximum survey volume and effective galaxy density at
a given position. Instead, they depend on the bias associated with the host
halo; the first and second factorial moments of the halo occupation
distribution; a selection function, which gives the fraction of galaxies that
can be observed in a halo of mass M at position r in the survey; and an
effective number density of galaxies. If one wishes to reconstruct the matter
power spectrum, then, provided the model is correct, this scheme provides the
only unbiased estimator. The practical challenges with implementing this
approach are also discussed.

superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling
manifests in the density of states and critical temperature. To describe a
general scenario, we allow for both Rashba and Dresselhaus type spin-orbit
coupling. Our results are obtained via the quasiclassical theory of
superconductivity, extended to include spin-orbit coupling in the Usadel
equation and Kupriyanov--Lukichev boundary conditions. Unlike previous works,
we have derived a Riccati parametrization of the Usadel equation with
spin-orbit coupling which allows us to address the full proximity regime.
First, we consider the density of states in both SF bilayers and SFS trilayers,
where the spectroscopic features in the latter case are sensitive to the phase
difference between the two superconductors. We find that the presence of
spin-orbit coupling leaves clear spectroscopic fingerprints in the density of
states due to its role in creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Unlike SF and SFS
structures without spin-orbit coupling, the density of states in the present
case depends strongly on the direction of magnetization. We show that the
spin-orbit coupling can stabilize singlet superconductivity even in the
presence of a strong exchange field $h \gg \Delta$. This leads to the
possibility of a magnetically tunable minigap: changing the direction of the
exchange field opens and closes the minigap. We also determine how the critical
temperature $T_c$ of an SF bilayer is affected by spin-orbit coupling and
demonstrate that one can achieve a spin-valve effect with a single ferromagnet.
We find that $T_c$ displays highly non-monotonic behavior both as a function of
the magnetization direction and the type and direction of the spin-orbit
coupling, offering a new way to exert control over the superconductivity of
proximity structures.

The considered quenches are either local or found to be effectively local. The
screening cloud is characterized by impurity-bath correlators and by the
entanglement of a block centered around the impurity with the rest of the
system. We consider several local quench protocols, such as, quenches from
initially decoupled to coupled impurity, quenches between different finite
couplings of the impurity, and `detuning quenches' involving changing the
onsite impurity potential away from or to the chemical potential of the bath.
The relevant correlators and the entanglement display versions of the
`light-cone' effect, since the information about the quench travels through the
bath at finite speed. At long times (`inside' the light cone), the impurity
screening cloud relaxes exponentially to the final equilibrium structure, with
the relaxation rate given by the emergent energy scale of impurity screening.
Also, snaphots of the time-evolving spatial profile of impurity-bath
correlators show exponential dependences on space, with the length scale given
by the screening length.

current experimental limit on the neutron EDM and possible future improvement
as a probe of high scale SUSY. Quantitative analyses show that scalar masses as
large as a PeV and larger could be probed in improved experiment far above the
scales accessible at future colliders. We also discuss the neutron EDM as a
probe of new physics models beyond MSSM. Specifically we consider an MSSM
extension with a particle content including a vectorlike multiplet. Such an
extension brings in new sources of CP violation beyond those in MSSM. These CP
phases contribute to the EDM of the quarks and to the neutron EDM. These
contributions are analyzed in this work where we include the supersymmetric
loop diagrams involving the neutralinos, charginos, the gluino, squark and
mirror squark exchange diagrams at the one loop level. We also take into
account the contributions from the $W$, $Z$, quark and mirror quark exchanges

solar power producers. Storage is different from the conventional generators
that have traditionally balanced supply and demand on fast time scales due to
its hard energy capacity constraints, dynamic coupling, and low marginal costs.
These differences are leading system operators to propose new mechanisms for
enabling storage to participate in reserve and real-time energy markets. The
persistence of market power and gaming in electricity markets suggests that
these changes will expose new vulnerabilities.
  We develop a new model of strategic behavior among storages in energy
balancing markets. Our model is a two-stage game that generalizes a classic
model of capacity followed by Bertrand-Edgeworth price competition by
explicitly modeling storage dynamics and uncertainty in the pricing stage. By
applying the model to balancing markets with storage, we are able to compare
capacity and energy-based pricing schemes, and to analyze the dynamic effects
of the market horizon and energy losses due to leakage. Our first key finding
is that capacity pricing leads to higher prices and higher capacity
commitments, and that energy pricing leads to lower, randomized prices and
lower capacity commitments. Second, we find that a longer market horizon and
higher physical efficiencies lead to lower prices by inducing the storage to
compete to have their states of charge cycled more frequently.

described as a new evidence of a biaxial nematic phase in an oxadiazole
bent-core thermotropic liquid crystal C7. With an assortment of optical
techniques such as polarizing optical microscopy, LC PolScope, and fluorescence
confocal polarizing microscopy, we demonstrate that the secondary disclinations
represent non-singular domain walls formed in an uniaxial nematic during the
surface anchoring transition, in which surface orientation of the director
changes from tangential (parallel to the bounding plates) to tilted. Each
domain wall separates two regions with the director tilted in opposite
azimuthal directions. At the centre of the wall, the director remains parallel
to the bonding plates. The domain walls can be easily removed by applying a
modest electric field. The anchoring transition is explained by the balance of
(a) the intrinsic perpendicular surface anchoring produced by the polyimide
aligning layer and (b) tangential alignment caused by ionic impurities forming
electric double layers. The model is supported by the fact that the temperature
of the tangential-tilted anchoring transition decreases as the cell thickness
increases and as the concentration of ionic species (added salt) increases. We
also demonstrate that the surface alignment is strongly affected by thermal
degradation of the samples. The study shows that C7 exhibits only a uniaxial
nematic phase and demonstrate yet another mechanism (formation of secondary
disclinations) by which a uniaxial nematic can mimic a biaxial nematic
behaviour.

witnessed that Massive MIMO is subject to several widespread misunderstandings,
as epitomized by following (fictional) abstract:
  ""The Massive MIMO technology uses a nearly infinite number of high-quality

special kinds of wireless channels have. This technology looks great at first

the antenna arrays would be so huge that it can only be implemented in
millimeter wave bands.""

article, we identify ten myths and explain why they are not true. We also ask a
question that is critical for the practical adoption of the technology and
which will require intense future research activities to answer properly. We

that supports any feasible traffic demand in data networks, but may have poor
delay performance when packets traverse loops in the network. In this paper, we
study loop-free backpressure routing policies that forward packets along
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to avoid the looping problem. These policies use
link reversal algorithms to improve the DAGs in order to support any achievable
traffic demand.
  For a network with a single commodity, we show that a DAG that supports a
given traffic demand can be found after a finite number of iterations of the
link-reversal process. We use this to develop a joint link-reversal and
backpressure routing policy, called the loop free backpressure (LFBP)
algorithm. This algorithm forwards packets on the DAG, while the DAG is
dynamically updated based on the growth of the queue backlogs. We show by
simulations that such a DAG-based policy improves the delay over the classical
backpressure routing policy. We also propose a multicommodity version of the
LFBP algorithm, and via simulation we show that its delay performance is better
than that of backpressure.

algorithm for extracting nonlinear features from data. In the presence of a
large volume of high dimensional data collected in a distributed fashion, it
becomes very costly to communicate all of this data to a single data center and
then perform kernel PCA. Can we perform kernel PCA on the entire dataset in a
distributed and communication efficient fashion while maintaining provable and
strong guarantees in solution quality?
  In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the question by developing a
communication efficient algorithm to perform kernel PCA in the distributed
setting. The algorithm is a clever combination of subspace embedding and
adaptive sampling techniques, and we show that the algorithm can take as input
an arbitrary configuration of distributed datasets, and compute a set of global
kernel principal components with relative error guarantees independent of the
dimension of the feature space or the total number of data points. In
particular, computing $k$ principal components with relative error $\epsilon$
over $s$ workers has communication cost $\tilde{O}(s \rho k/\epsilon+s
k^2/\epsilon^3)$ words, where $\rho$ is the average number of nonzero entries
in each data point. Furthermore, we experimented the algorithm with large-scale

the nonlinear evolution of a collisionless tearing mode in a two-fluid model

cooperatively enable a fast reconnection by forming an X-shaped current-vortex
layer centered at the reconnection point. A high-resolution simulation of this
model for an unprecedentedly small electron skin depth $d_e$ and ion-sound
gyroradius $\rho_s$, satisfying $d_e=\rho_s$, shows an explosive tendency for
nonlinear growth of the tearing mode, where it is newly found that the
explosive widening of the X-shaped layer occurs locally around the reconnection
point with the length of the X shape being shorter than the domain length and
the wavelength of the linear tearing mode. The reason for the onset of this
locally enhanced reconnection is explained theoretically by developing a novel
nonlinear and nonequilibrium inner solution that models the local X-shaped
layer, and then matching it to an outer solution that is approximated by a
linear tearing eigenmode with a shorter wavelength than the domain length. This

estimating of the scale parameter at bits-level. Our technique can be naturally
applied to data stream computations for estimating the $\alpha$-th frequency
moment. In fact, the method applies to the general scale family of
distributions, not limited to $\alpha$-stable distributions.
  Due to the heavy-tailed nature of $\alpha$-stable distributions, using
traditional estimators will potentially need many bits to store each
measurement in order to ensure sufficient accuracy. Interestingly, our paper
demonstrates that, using a simple closed-form estimator with merely 1-bit
information does not result in a significant loss of accuracy if the parameter
is chosen appropriately. For example, when $\alpha=0+$, 1, and 2, the
coefficients of the optimal estimation variances using full (i.e.,
infinite-bit) information are 1, 2, and 2, respectively. With the 1-bit scheme
and appropriately chosen parameters, the corresponding variance coefficients
are 1.544, $\pi^2/4$, and 3.066, respectively. Theoretical tail bounds are also
provided. Using 2 or more bits per measurements reduces the estimation variance
and importantly, stabilizes the estimate so that the variance is not sensitive
to parameters. With look-up tables, the computational cost is minimal.

The produced partons lose energy within the quark gluon plasma and hadronize
collinearly when they leave it. The energy and momentum deposited into the
plasma is described using linear viscous hydrodynamics with a constant energy
loss per unit length and a total energy loss given by a Gaussian probability
centered around a mean value $\bar{\mathcal{E}}$ and a half-width

CERN-CMS Collaboration can indeed be attributed to parton energy loss in the

slight enhancement coming from the contribution of $2\to 3$ parton processes
that modifies the asymmetry distribution of the dijet events. We compare our

sizable CP asymmetry in these rare decays, which calls for dedicated

equation, and their discrete versions are, respectively, gauge equivalent to a
discrete Heisenberg-like equation and a discrete modified Heisenberg-like
equation. From the gauge equivalence, although the geometry related to the
nonlocal NLS is not very clear, we can see that the properties between the
nonlocal NLS and its discrete version and NLS and discrete NLS have big
difference. By constructing the Darboux transformation for discrete nonlocal
NLS equations including the cases of focusing and defocusing, we derive their
discrete soliton solutions, which differ from the ones obtained by using the

  Responsive Loads",,,,,"cs.SY math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aggregate load modeling is of fundamental importance for systematic analysis
and design of various demand response strategies. Instead of keeping track of
the trajectories of individual loads, the aggregate modeling problem focuses on
characterizing the density evolution of the load population. Most existing
models are only applicable to Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCL) with
first-order linear dynamics. This paper develops a unified aggregate modeling
approach that can be used for general TCLs as well as deferrable loads. We
propose a deterministic hybrid system model to describe individual load
dynamics under demand response rules, and develop a general stochastic hybrid
system (SHS) model to capture the population dynamics. We also derive a set of
partial differential equations (PDE) that governs the probability density
evolution of the SHS. Our results cannot be obtained using the exiting SHS
tools in the literature as the proposed SHS model involves both random and
deterministic switchings with general switching surfaces in multi-dimensional
domains. The derived PDE model includes many existing aggregate load modeling
results as special cases and can be used in many other realistic modeling
scenarios that have not been studied in the literature.

Linear Models (GLMs) have been proposed in the literature; however, the choice
of prior distribution of g and resulting properties for inference have received
considerably less attention. In this paper, we unify mixtures of g-priors in
GLMs by assigning the truncated Compound Confluent Hypergeometric (tCCH)
distribution to 1/(1 + g), which encompasses as special cases several mixtures
of g-priors in the literature, such as the hyper-g, Beta-prime, truncated
Gamma, incomplete inverse-Gamma, benchmark, robust, hyper-g/n, and intrinsic
priors. Through an integrated Laplace approximation, the posterior distribution
of 1/(1 + g) is in turn a tCCH distribution, and approximate marginal
likelihoods are thus available analytically, leading to ""Compound
Hypergeometric Information Criteria"" for model selection. We discuss the local
geometric properties of the g-prior in GLMs and show how the desiderata for
model selection proposed by Bayarri et al, such as asymptotic model selection
consistency, intrinsic consistency, and measurement invariance may be used to
justify the prior and specific choices of the hyper parameters. We illustrate
inference using these priors and contrast them to other approaches via
simulation and real data examples. The methodology is implemented in the R

  Our principal result is a very general product representation theorem.
Specifically, we present a syntactic procedure (called duplication) for
building a product algebra out of a given base algebra and a given set of
terms. The procedure lifts functorially to the generated varieties and leads,
under specified sufficient conditions, to a categorical equivalence between
these varieties. When these conditions are satisfied, a very tight algebraic
relationship exists between the base variety and the enriched variety. Moreover
varieties arising as duplicates of a common base variety are automatically
categorically equivalent to each other. Two further product representation
constructions are also presented; these are in the same spirit as our main
theorem and extend the scope of our analysis.
  Our catalogue of applications selects varieties for which product
representations have previously been obtained one by one, or which are new. We
also reveal that certain varieties arising from the modelling of quite
different operations are categorically equivalent. Among the range of examples
presented, we draw attention in particular to our systematic treatment of
trilattices.

reservoir engineering through the utilization of non-Markovian baths with
different types of Lorentzian and ohmic spectral densities can lead to an
entanglement survival for longer times and in some cases considerable regain of
seemingly lost entanglement. Both of these behaviors indicate a better
sustainability of entanglement (in time) compared to the usual Markovian bath
situations which assumes a flat spectrum of the bath around the system resonant
frequency. Our scheme shows these effects in the context of optical cavities
starting off in a maximally entangled W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)

Lorentzian baths with small coupling strengths and for ohmic type baths
super-ohmic environments with smaller cutoff frequencies are the best
candidates for preserving entanglement among cavities for significant amount of
time. A non-Markovian quantum jump approach is employed to understand the

in quantitatively measuring software quality in use. But, why is quality-in-use

authors' knowledge no works survey the challenges related to software
quality-in-use measurement. This article has two main contributions: 1) it
identifies and explains major issues and challenges in measuring software
quality in use in the context of the ISO SQuaRE series and related software
quality models and highlights open research areas; and 2) it sheds light on a
research direction that can be used to predict software quality in use. In
short, the quality-in-use measurement issues are related to the complexity of
the current standard models and the limitations and incompleteness of the

Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL) theory. Landau's FL theory succeeds in describing
electronic properties of some correlated electron systems at low temperatures.
However, the behaviors deviating from the temperature dependence in the FL,
non-FL-like behaviors, emerge near a magnetic quantum-critical point. These
indicate the importance of many-body effects beyond Landau's FL theory. Those
effects in multiorbital systems have been little understood, although their
understanding is important to deduce ubiquitous properties of correlated
electron systems and characteristic properties of multiorbital systems. To
improve this situation, I formulate the resistivity of a multiorbital Hubbard
model using the extended \'{E}liashberg theory and adopt this method to the
inplane resistivity of quasi-two-dimensional paramagnetic ruthenates in
combination with the fluctuation-exchange approximation including the current
vertex corrections arising from the self-energy and Maki-Thompson term. The
results away from and near the antiferromagnetic quantum-critical point
reproduce the temperature dependence observed in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and
Sr$_{2}$Ru$_{0.075}$Ti$_{0.025}$O$_{4}$, respectively. I highlight the

perform worse than this simple baseline classifier, this behaviour requires a
special explanation. Aiming to motivate the community to compare experimental

the attention about the need of special explanations related to classifiers
which perform worse than the baseline, in this work we propose the use of
General_B, a multi-label baseline classifier. General_B was evaluated in
contrast to results published in the literature which were carefully selected
using a systematic review process. It was found that a considerable number of
published results on 10 frequently used datasets are worse than or equal to the

not considered in these publications, it was observed that even for very poor

shear, which arises when there is a radial variation in the temperature or
entropy. Such discs are subject to a ""vertical-shear instability"", which recent
nonlinear simulations have shown to drive hydrodynamic activity in the
MRI-stable regions of protoplanetary discs. We first revisit locally isothermal
discs using the quasi-global reduced model derived by Nelson et al. (2013).
This analysis is then extended to global axisymmetric perturbations in a
cylindrical domain. We also derive and study a reduced model describing discs
with power law radial entropy profiles (""locally polytropic discs""), which are
somewhat more realistic in that they possess physical (as opposed to numerical)
surfaces. In all cases the fastest growing modes have very short wavelengths
and are localised at the disc surfaces (if present), where the vertical shear
is maximal. An additional class of modestly growing vertically global body
modes is excited, corresponding to destabilised classical inertial waves
(""r-modes""). We discuss the properties of both types of modes, and stress that
those that grow fastest occur on the shortest available length scales
(determined either by the numerical grid or the physical viscous length). This
ill-posedness makes simulations of the instability difficult to interpret. We
end with some brief speculation on the nonlinear saturation and resulting
angular momentum transport.

show that the Solar/Stellar Wind Charge Exchange Mechanism (SWCX) which
produces soft X-ray emission is very effective for hot Jupiters. In this
mechanism, X-ray photons are emitted as a result of the charge exchange between
heavy ions in the solar wind and the atmospheric neutral particles. In the
Solar System, comets produce X-rays mostly through the SWCX mechanism, but it
has also been shown to operate in the heliosphere, in the terrestrial
magnetosheath, and on Mars, Venus and Moon. Since the number of emitted photons
is proportional to the solar wind mass flux, this mechanism is not very
effective for the Solar system giants. Here we present a simple estimate of the
X-ray emission intensity that can be produced by close-in extrasolar giant
planets due to charge exchange with the heavy ions of the stellar wind. Using
the example of HD~209458b, we show that this mechanism alone can be responsible
for an X-ray emission of $\approx 10^{22}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, which is $10^6$ times
stronger than the emission from the Jovian aurora. We discuss also the
possibility to observe the predicted soft X-ray flux of hot Jupiters and show
that despite high emission intensities they are unobservable with current

straight line triangle representations. Since the discrete harmonic function

Here, both the energy and the metric underlying the gradient flow are

scaling under the gradient flow. In each time step of the gradient flow a
nested optimization problem has to be solved. Thereby, an outer variational
problem reflects the time discretization of the actual Willmore flow and
involves an approximate anisotropic $L^2$-distance between two consecutive time
steps and a fully implicit approximation of the anisotropic Willmore energy.
The anisotropic mean curvature needed to evaluate the energy integrand is
replaced by the time discrete, approximate speed from an inner, fully implicit

achieved is studied by means of a simple two-body reaction. From the discussion
it will become clear that the LIT method is an approach with a controlled

resonances in the many-body continuum. As an example the isoscalar monopole
resonance of 4He is considered. The importance of the choice of a proper basis

convenient alternative to B-series. Associated with word series is a group G of

Butcher group. From a more mathematical point of view, integrators, like
Runge-Kutta schemes, that are affine equivariant are represented by elements of
the Butcher group, integrators that are equivariant with respect to arbitrary

Norsen has made significant concessions. In his response, Norsen admits that

different things: his 1964 theorem (assuming locality and determinism) and his
1976 theorem (assuming local causality), respectively. Thus, it is heartening
that at least one person from one side has taken one step on my bridge. That
said, there are several issues of contention with Norsen, which we (the two

most significant issues are: the indefiniteness of the word 'locality' prior to

Multi-satellite constellations in unique orbital slots offer gradual deployment

specifically, the scenario presented herein, involves two co-existing multibeam
satellites which illuminate overlapping coverage areas. Based on this scenario,
specific types of cooperative and cognitive techniques are herein considered as
candidate technologies that can boost the performance of multibeam satellite
constellations. These techniques are compared to conventional frequency
splitting configurations in terms of three different criteria, namely the
spectral efficiency, the power efficiency and the fairness. Consequently,
insightful guidelines for the design of future high throughput constellations

standard chemical evolution models of the Milky Way, and shows that the
chemical-enrichment history of the Galactic disc is more complex. We find
similar stars in previously published samples for which isochrone-ages could be
robustly obtained, although in smaller relative numbers, which could explain
why these stars have not received prior attention. The young [alpha/Fe]-rich
stars are much more numerous in the CoRoT-APOGEE (CoRoGEE) inner-field sample
than in any other high-resolution sample available at present, as only CoRoGEE
can explore the inner-disc regions and provide ages for its field stars. The
kinematic properties of the young [$\alpha$/Fe]-rich stars are not clearly
thick-disc like, despite their rather large distances from the Galactic
mid-plane. Our tentative interpretation of these and previous intriguing
observations in the Milky Way is that these stars were formed close to the end
of the Galactic bar, near corotation -- a region where gas can be kept inert
for longer times, compared to other regions shocked more frequently by the
passage of spiral arms. Moreover, that is where the mass return from older
inner-disc stellar generations should be maximal (according to an inside-out
disc-formation scenario), further diluting the in-situ gas. Other possibilities
to explain these observations (e.g., a recent gas-accretion event) are also

The approach utilises ""virtual-packets"" that are generated during the

for specific observer orientations. Compared to extracting synthetic
observables by direct binning of emergent Monte Carlo quanta, this
virtual-packet approach leads to a substantial reduction in the Monte Carlo

degree of polarisation is typically very small) but also useful for

application of an idealised test code to simple geometries. We then describe
its implementation in the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS and present
test calculations for simple models for Type Ia supernovae. Specifically, we
use the well-known one-dimensional W7 model to verify that our scheme can
accurately recover zero polarisation from a spherical model, and to demonstrate
the reduction in Monte Carlo noise compared to a simple packet-binning
approach. To investigate the impact of aspherical ejecta on the polarisation
spectra, we then use ARTIS to calculate synthetic observables for prolate and

shown to be robust in various low-SNR conditions. Thirdly, the noise energy
level in each signal unit is estimated recursively based on the estimated SNR
for units with high PD and based on the noisy signal energy level for units

also to the increase of cooling needs due to over-exposure to solar radiation.
When under-dimensioned, the same space may benefit from reduced heat losses
through the glazing surface but does not benefit from solar radiation gains.
Therefore, it is important to find the optimum design that minimizes both the
heating and cooling needs. This paper presents a parametric study of window
type (single, double and triple glazing), orientation and opening size, located
in the city of Coimbra, Portugal. An annual and a seasonal assessment were
done, in order to obtain the set of optimum values around 360 degree
orientation.

play multiple -even incompatible- roles in their social contexts
simultaneously, and have limited interaction ranges. Specifically, this article
proposes two reinforcement learning methods for agents to compute agreements on
strategies for using common resources to perform joint tasks. The computation
of norms by considering agents' playing multiple roles in their social contexts
has not been studied before. To make the problem even more realistic for open
societies, we do not assume that agents share knowledge on their common
resources. So, they have to compute semantic agreements towards performing
their joint actions. %The paper reports on an empirical study of whether and
how efficiently societies of agents converge to norms, exploring the proposed
social learning processes w.r.t. different society sizes, and the ways agents
are connected. The results reported are very encouraging, regarding the speed
of the learning process as well as the convergence rate, even in quite complex
settings.

disordered models. Since localization leads to Poissonian energy level
statistics, we ask if localized systems possess ""additional"" integrals of
motion as well, so as to enhance the analogy with quantum integrable systems.
We answer this in the affirmative in the present work. We construct a set of
nontrivial integrals of motion for Anderson localized models, in terms of the
original creation and annihilation operators. These are found as a power series
in the hopping parameter. The recently found Type-1 Hamiltonians, which are
known to be quantum integrable in a precise sense, motivate our construction.
We note that these models can be viewed as disordered electron models with
infinite-range hopping, where a similar series truncates at the linear order.
We show that despite the infinite range hopping, all states but one are
localized. We also study the conservation laws for the disorder free
Aubry-Andre model, where the states are either localized or extended, depending
on the strength of a coupling constant. We formulate a specific procedure for
averaging over disorder, in order to examine the convergence of the power
series. Using this procedure in the Aubry-Andre model, we show that integrals
of motion given by our construction are well-defined in localized phase, but
not so in the extended phase. Finally, we also obtain the integrals of motion
for a model with interactions to lowest order in the interaction.

is typically modeled by a variety of laws that parametrize the intensity
profile of the star that is being transited. Confronted with a transit
lightcurve, some authors fix the parameters of these laws, the so-called
limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs), while others prefer to let them float in
the lightcurve fitting procedure. Which of these is the best strategy, however,
is still unclear, as well as how and by how much each of these can bias the
retrieved transit parameters. In this work we attempt to clarify those points
by first re-calculating these LDCs, comparing them to measured values from
Kepler transit lightcurves using an algorithm that takes into account
uncertainties in both the geometry of the transit and the parameters of the
stellar host. We show there are significant departures from predicted model
values, suggesting that our understanding of limb-darkening still needs to
improve. Then, we show through simulations that if one uses the quadratic
limb-darkening law to parametrize limb-darkening, fixing and fitting the LDCs
can lead to significant biases -up to $\sim 3\%$ and $\sim 1\%$ in $R_p/R_*$,
respectively-, which are important for several confirmed and candidate
exoplanets. We conclude that, in this case, the best approach is to let the
LDCs be free in the fitting procedure. Strategies to avoid biases in data from

independent Cho-Duan-Ge Abelian decomposition.
  The decomposition is defined in terms of a colour field $n$; the principle
novelty of our study is that we have defined this field in terms of the
eigenvectors of the Wilson Loop. This establishes an equivalence between the
path ordered integral of the non-Abelian gauge fields with an integral over an
Abelian restricted gauge field which is tractable both theoretically and
numerically in lattice QCD. We circumvent path ordering without needing an
additional path integral. By using Stokes' theorem, we can compute the Wilson
Loop in terms of a surface integral over a restricted field strength, and show
that the restricted field strength may be dominated by certain structures,
which occur when one of the quantities parametrising the colour field $n$ winds
itself around a non-analyticity in the colour field. If they exist, these
structures will lead to a area law scaling for the Wilson Loop and provide a
mechanism for quark confinement.
  We search for these structures in quenched lattice QCD. We perform the
Abelian decomposition, and compare the electric and magnetic fields with the
patterns expected theoretically. We find that the restricted field strength is
dominated by objects which may be peaks a single lattice spacing in size or
extended string-like lines of electromagnetic flux. The objects are not
isolated monopoles, as they generate electric fields in addition to magnetic
fields, and the fields are not spherically symmetric, but may be either caused
by a monopole/anti-monopole condensate, some other types of topological objects
or a combination of these. Removing these peaks removes the area law scaling of
the string tension, suggesting that they are responsible for confinement.

be switched on and off discontinuously and in a non-volatile fashion.
Furthermore, the reversal of the polarization can be used to switch between a

age?"" and ""How do we age?"" Among them, evolutionary theories are proposed to
interpret the evolutionary advantage of aging, and ""saving resources for group
benefit"" is thought to be the purpose of aging. However for saving resources, a
more economic strategy should be to make a rapid death to the individuals who
are over the reproduction age rather than to make them aging. Biological
theories are proposed to identify the causes and the biological processes of
aging. However, some theories including cell senescence/telomere theory,
gene-controlling theory, and developmental theory, have unfortunately ignored
the influence of damage on aging. Free-radical theory suggests that free
radicals by causing intrinsic damage are the main cause of aging. However, even
if intracellular free radicals cause injuries, they could be only associated
with some but not all of the aging changes. Damage (fault)-accumulation theory
predicts that faults as intrinsic damage can accumulate and lead to aging.
However, in fact an unrepaired fault could not possibly remain in a living
organism, since it can destroy the integrity of tissue structure and cause
rapid failure of the organism. These traditional theories are all incomplete on
interpreting aging phenomena. Nevertheless, developmental theory and damage
(fault)-accumulation theory are more useful, because they have recognized the
importance of damage and development process in aging. Some physical theories
are useful, because they point out the common characteristics of aging changes,
including loss of complexity, consequence of increase of entropy, and failure
of information-transmission. An advanced theory, which can include all of these
useful ideas in traditional theories, is needed.

poorly understood. Spectra of M dwarf flares in the optical and
near-ultraviolet wavelength regimes have revealed three continuum components
during the impulsive phase: 1) an energetically dominant blackbody component
with a color temperature of T $\sim$ 10,000 K in the blue-optical, 2) a smaller
amount of Balmer continuum emission in the near-ultraviolet at lambda $<$ 3646
Angstroms and 3) an apparent pseudo-continuum of blended high-order Balmer
lines. These properties are not reproduced by models that employ a typical
""solar-type"" flare heating level in nonthermal electrons, and therefore our
understanding of these spectra is limited to a phenomenological interpretation.
We present a new 1D radiative-hydrodynamic model of an M dwarf flare from
precipitating nonthermal electrons with a large energy flux of $10^{13}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The simulation produces bright continuum emission from a
dense, hot chromospheric condensation. For the first time, the observed color
temperature and Balmer jump ratio are produced self-consistently in a
radiative-hydrodynamic flare model. We find that a T $\sim$ 10,000 K
blackbody-like continuum component and a small Balmer jump ratio result from
optically thick Balmer and Paschen recombination radiation, and thus the
properties of the flux spectrum are caused by blue light escaping over a larger
physical depth range compared to red and near-ultraviolet light. To model the
near-ultraviolet pseudo-continuum previously attributed to overlapping Balmer
lines, we include the extra Balmer continuum opacity from Landau-Zener
transitions that result from merged, high order energy levels of hydrogen in a
dense, partially ionized atmosphere. This reveals a new diagnostic of ambient
charge density in the densest regions of the atmosphere that are heated during
dMe and solar flares.

and Kerr metrics and investigate innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO). The
main goal of this work is to find analytically the small-spin corrections for
the parameters of ISCO (radius, total angular momentum, energy, orbital angular
frequency) of spinning test particles in the case of vectors of black hole
spin, particle spin and orbital angular momentum being collinear to each other.
We analytically derive the small-spin linear corrections for arbitrary Kerr
parameter $a$. The cases of Schwarzschild, slowly rotating and extreme Kerr
black hole are considered in details. For a slowly rotating black hole the ISCO
parameters are obtained up to quadratic in $a$ and particle's spin $s$ terms.
From the formulae obtained it is seen that the spin-orbital coupling has
attractive character when spin and angular momentum are parallel and repulsive
when they are antiparallel. For the case of the extreme Kerr black hole with
co-rotating particle we succeed to find the exact analytical solution for the
limiting ISCO parameters for arbitrary spin. It has been shown that the
limiting values of ISCO radius and frequency do not depend on the particle's
spin while values of energy and total angular momentum depend on it. We have
also considered circular orbits of arbitrary radius and have found small-spin
linear corrections for the total angular momentum and energy at given radius.
System of equations for numerical calculation of ISCO parameters for arbitrary
$a$ and $s$ is also explicitly written.

key properties, e.g. magnetization, plasmonic response or conductivity, with
the ligand molecules giving rise to others like solubility, assembly or
interaction with biomolecules. The formation of these supracrystals depends on
a complex interplay between many forces, some stemming from the core, some from
the ligands. At present, there is no known approach to characterize the local
order of ligand molecules or their dynamics with atomic spatial resolution.
Here, we develop a methodology based on small-angle ultrafast electron
diffraction combined with angular cross-correlation analysis to characterize a
two-dimensional supracrystal of dodecanethiol-coated gold NPs. We retrieve the
static arrangement of the ligands, showing that at equilibrium they order in a
preferential orientation on the NPs surface and throughout the two-dimensional
supracrystal. Upon light excitation, positional disorder is induced in the
supracrystal, while its overall homogeneity is surprisingly found to
transiently increase. This suggests that transient annealing of the
supracrystal takes place within few picoseconds (ps). This methodology will
enable the systematic investigation of the dynamical structural properties of
nano-assembled materials containing light elements, relevant for biological
applications.

intractable distributions have gained recent interest and have been
theoretically studied in considerable depth. Their main appeal is that they are
exact, in the sense that they target marginally the correct invariant
distribution. However, the pseudo-marginal Markov chain can exhibit poor mixing
and slow convergence towards its target. As an alternative, a subtly different
Markov chain can be simulated, where better mixing is possible but the
exactness property is sacrificed. This is the noisy algorithm, initially
conceptualised as Monte Carlo within Metropolis (MCWM), which has also been
studied but to a lesser extent. The present article provides a further
characterisation of the noisy algorithm, with a focus on fundamental stability
properties like positive recurrence and geometric ergodicity. Sufficient
conditions for inheriting geometric ergodicity from a standard
Metropolis-Hastings chain are given, as well as convergence of the invariant
distribution towards the true target distribution.

  binary solutions of hydrotropes",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hydrotropes are substances consisting of amphiphilic molecules that are too
small to self assemble in equilibrium structures in aqueous solutions, but can
form dynamic molecular clusters H bonded with water molecules. Some
hydrotropes, such as low molecular weight alcohols and amines, can solubilize
hydrophobic compounds in aqueous solutions at a mesoscopic scale, around 100
nm, with formation of long lived mesoscale droplets. In this work, we report on
the studies of near critical and phase behavior of binary, 2,6-lutidine - H2O,
and quasibinary, 2,6-lutidine - H2O - D2O, and tert-butanol - 2-butanol - H2O
solutions in the presence of a solubilized hydrophobic impurity, cyclohexane.
In additional to visual observation of fluid phase equilibria, two experimental
techniques were used - light scattering and small - angle neutron scattering.
It was found that the increase of the tert-butanol to 2-butanol ratio affects
the liquid - liquid equilibria in the quasi-binary system at ambient pressure
in the same way as the increase of pressure modifies the phase behavior of
binary 2-butanol - H2O solutions. The correlation length of critical
fluctuations near the liquid-liquid separation and the size of mesoscale
droplets of solubilized cyclohexane were obtained by dynamic light scattering
and by small - angle neutron scattering. It is shown that the effect of the
presence of small amounts of cyclohexane on the near - critical phase behavior
is twofold - the transition temperature changes towards increasing the
two-phase domain, and long-lived mesoscopic inhomogeneities emerge in the
macroscopically homogeneous domain. These homogeneities remain unchanged upon
approach to the critical point of macroscopic phase separation and do not alter
the universal nature of criticality. However, a larger amount of cyclohexane
generates additional liquid-liquid phase separation at lower temperatures.

complex axiomatic formalisations. We conduct an overhaul of SC atomics in C11,
reducing the associated axioms in both number and complexity. A consequence of
our simplification is that the SC operations in an execution no longer need to
be totally ordered. This relaxation enables, for the first time, efficient and
exhaustive simulation of litmus tests that use SC atomics. We extend our
improved C11 model to obtain the first rigorous memory model formalisation for
OpenCL (which extends C11 with support for heterogeneous many-core
programming). In the OpenCL setting, we refine the SC axioms still further to
give a sensible semantics to SC operations that employ a 'memory scope' to
restrict their visibility to specific threads. Our overhaul requires slight
strengthenings of both the C11 and the OpenCL memory models, causing some
behaviours to become disallowed. We argue that these strengthenings are
natural, and that all of the formalised C11 and OpenCL compilation schemes of
which we are aware (Power and x86 CPUs for C11, AMD GPUs for OpenCL) remain
valid in our revised models. Using the Herd memory model simulator, we show
that our overhaul leads to an exponential improvement in simulation time for
C11 litmus tests compared with the original model, making exhaustive simulation
competitive, time-wise, with the non-exhaustive CDSChecker tool.

studying their formation and evolution. Surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) have resulted in the availability of very large collections of
images, which have permitted population-wide analyses of galaxy morphology.
Morphological analysis has traditionally been carried out mostly via visual
inspection by trained experts, which is time-consuming and does not scale to
large ($\gtrsim10^4$) numbers of images.
  Although attempts have been made to build automated classification systems,
these have not been able to achieve the desired level of accuracy. The Galaxy
Zoo project successfully applied a crowdsourcing strategy, inviting online
users to classify images by answering a series of questions. Unfortunately,
even this approach does not scale well enough to keep up with the increasing
availability of galaxy images.
  We present a deep neural network model for galaxy morphology classification
which exploits translational and rotational symmetry. It was developed in the
context of the Galaxy Challenge, an international competition to build the best
model for morphology classification based on annotated images from the Galaxy
Zoo project.
  For images with high agreement among the Galaxy Zoo participants, our model
is able to reproduce their consensus with near-perfect accuracy ($> 99\%$) for
most questions. Confident model predictions are highly accurate, which makes
the model suitable for filtering large collections of images and forwarding
challenging images to experts for manual annotation. This approach greatly
reduces the experts' workload without affecting accuracy. The application of
these algorithms to larger sets of training data will be critical for analysing
results from future surveys such as the LSST.

information to untrained users via only their hands without using any visual or
auditory cues. Our simple concept is presenting three-dimensional letter
trajectories to the user's hand via a stylus which is mechanically manipulated.
By this simple method, in our experiments, participants were able to read 14
mm-high lower-case letters displayed at a rate of one letter per second with an
accuracy rate of 71.9% in their first trials, which was improved to 91.3% after
a five-minute training period. These results showed small individual
differences among participants (standard deviation of 12.7% in the first trials
and 6.7% after training). We also found that this accuracy was still retained
to a high level (85.1% with SD of 8.2%) even when the letters were reduced to a
height of 7 mm. Thus, we revealed that sighted adults potentially possess the
ability to read small letters accurately at normal writing speed using their
hands.

serve a set of selfish agents whose addresses are their private information. In
a classical facility game, each agent wants to be as close to a facility as
possible, and the cost of an agent can be defined as the distance between her
location and the closest facility. In an obnoxious facility game, each agent
wants to be far away from all facilities, and her utility is the distance from
her location to the facility set. The objective of each agent is to minimize
her cost or maximize her utility. An agent may lie if, by doing so, more
benefit can be obtained. We are interested in social choice mechanisms that do
not utilize payments. The game designer aims at a mechanism that is
strategy-proof, in the sense that any agent cannot benefit by misreporting her
address, or, even better, group strategy-proof, in the sense that any coalition
of agents cannot all benefit by lying. Meanwhile, it is desirable to have the
mechanism to be approximately optimal with respect to a chosen objective
function. Several models for such approximation mechanism design without money
for facility games have been proposed. In this paper we briefly review these
models and related results for both deterministic and randomized mechanisms,
and meanwhile we present a general framework for approximation mechanism design
without money for facility games.

hydrodynamic representation of the Klein-Gordon-Einstein equations in the weak
field limit. We consider a complex self-interacting scalar field with a
$\lambda|\varphi|^4$ potential. We study the evolution of the homogeneous
background in the fluid representation and derive the linearized equations
describing the evolution of small perturbations in a static and in an expanding
universe. We compare the results with simplified models in which the
gravitational potential is introduced by hand in the Klein-Gordon equation, and
assumed to satisfy a (generalized) Poisson equation. We study the evolution of
the perturbations in the matter era using the nonrelativistic limit of our
formalism. Perturbations whose wavelength is below the Jeans length oscillate
in time while pertubations whose wavelength is above the Jeans length grow
linearly with the scale factor as in the cold dark matter model. The growth of
perturbations in the scalar field model is substantially faster than in the
cold dark matter model. When the wavelength of the pertubations approaches the
cosmological horizon (Hubble length), a relativistic treatment is mandatory. In
that case, we find that relativistic effects attenuate or even prevent the
growth of pertubations. This paper exposes the general formalism and provides
illustrations in simple cases. Other applications of our formalism will be
considered in companion papers.

proteins that sense molecular signals on the exterior of a cell and activate
signal transduction pathways within the cell. Modeling how an agonist activates
such a receptor is fundamental for an understanding of a wide variety of
physiological processes and it is of tremendous value for pharmacology and drug
design. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) has been proposed as a
model for the mechanism by which olfactory GPCRs are activated by a bound
agonist. We apply this hypothesis to GPCRs within the mammalian nervous system
using quantum chemical modeling. We found that non-endogenous agonists of the
serotonin receptor share a particular IET spectral aspect both amongst each
other and with the serotonin molecule: a peak whose intensity scales with the
known agonist potencies. We propose an experiential validation of this model by
utilizing lysergic acid dimethylamide (DAM-57), an ergot derivative, and its
deuterated isotopologues; we also provide theoretical predictions for
comparison to experiment. If validated our theory may provide new avenues for
guided drug design and elevate methods of in silico potency/activity

preserving properties. The main goal of the current article is to embark on
univariate constrained fractal interpolation that is more general than what was
considered so far. To this end, we propose some strategies for selecting the
parameters of the rational fractal spline so that the interpolating curves lie
strictly above or below a prescribed linear or a quadratic spline function.
Approximation property of the proposed rational cubic fractal spine is broached
by using the Peano kernel theorem as an interlude. The paper also provides an
illustration of background theory, veined by examples.

interaction partners. It involves screening for pairs of tetrahedra
representing interacting amino acids at the interface of the protein-protein
complex, with one tetrahedron on each protomer. H-bonds and VDW interactions at
their interface are first determined and then interacting tetrahedral motifs
(one from each protomer) representing backbone or side chain centroids of the
interacting amino acids, are then built. The method requires that the protein
protomers be transformed first into double-centroid reduced representation
(Reyes, V.M. & Sheth, V.N., 2011; Reyes, V.M., 2015a). The method is applied to
a set of 801 protein structures in the PDB with unknown functions, which were
screened for pairs of tetrahedral motifs characteristic of nine binary
complexes, namely: (1.) RAP-Gmppnp-cRAF1 Ras-binding domain; (2.) RHOA-protein
kinase PKN/PRK1 effector domain; (3.) RAC-HOGD1; (4.) RAC-P67PHOX; (5.)
kinase-associated phosphatase (KAP)-phosphoCDK2; (6.) Ig Fc-protein A fragment
B; (7.) Ig light chain dimers; (8.) beta catenin-HTCF-4; and (9.) IL-2
homodimers. Our search method found 33, 297, 62, 63, 120, 0, 108, 16 and 504
putative complexes, respectively. After considering the degree of interface
overlap between the protomers, these numbers were significantly trimmed down to
4, 2, 1, 8, 3, 0, 1, 1 and 1, respectively. Negative and positive control
experiments indicate that the screening process has acceptable specificity and
sensitivity. The results were further validated by applying the CP and TS
methods (Reyes, V.M., 2015b) for the quantitative determination of interface
burial and inter-protomer overlap in the complex. Our method is simple, fast
and scalable, and once the partner interface 3D SMs are identified, they can be
used to computationally dock the two protomers together to form the complex.
