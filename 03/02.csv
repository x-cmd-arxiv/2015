in terms of accuracy requirements, with as small a model size as possible. This
article highlights some recent developments concerning this issue for the so
called Reduced Basis Method (RBM) for models based on parameter dependent
families of PDEs. In this context the key task is to sample the {\em solution
manifold} at judiciously chosen parameter values usually determined in a {\em
greedy fashion}. The corresponding {\em space growth} concepts are closely
related to so called {\em weak greedy} algorithms in Hilbert and Banach spaces
which can be shown to give rise to convergence rates comparable to the best
possible rates, namely the {\em Kolmogorov $n$-widths} rates. Such algorithms
can be interpreted as {\em adaptive sampling} strategies for approximating
compact sets in Hilbert spaces. We briefly discuss the results most relevant
for the present RBM context. The applicability of the results for weak greedy
algorithms has however been confined so far essentially to well-conditioned
coercive problems. A critical issue is therefore an extension of these concepts
to a wider range of problem classes for which the conventional methods do not
work well. A second main topic of this article is therefore to outline recent
developments of RBMs that do realize $n$-width rates for a much wider class of
variational problems covering indefinite or singularly perturbed unsymmetric
problems. A key element in this context is the design of {\em well-conditioned
variational formulations} and their numerical treatment via saddle point
formulations. We conclude with some remarks concerning the relevance of
uniformly approximating the whole solution manifold also when the {\em quantity

frequency (RF) signals. Working with high frequency signals requires
appropriate system-level components such as high-speed analog-to-digital
converters (ADC). In particular, an analog signal should be sampled at rates
that meet the Nyquist requirements to avoid aliasing. However, implementing
high-speed ADC devices can be a limiting factor as well as expensive. To
mitigate the caveats with high-speed ADC, the solution space can be explored in
several dimensions such as utilizing the compressive sensing (CS) framework in
order to reduce the sampling rate to the order of information rate of the
signal rather than a rate dictated by the Nyquist. In this note, we review the
compressive sensing structure and its extensions for continuous-time signals,
which is ultimately used to reduce the sampling rate of high-speed ADC devices.
Moreover, we consider the application of the compressive sensing framework in
wireless sensor networks to save power by reducing the transmission rate of
sensor nodes. We propose an alternative solution for the CS minimization
problem that can be solved using gradient descent methods. The modified
minimization problem is potentially faster and simpler to implement at the
hardware level.

an overall variation in the amplitudes of around $10$% in the low mass and up

of the location of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) obtained with the polarization
ratio technique. The method takes advantage of the different distributions
along the line of sight (LOS) of total (tB) and polarized (pB) brightnesses to
estimate the average location of the emitting plasma. To this end, we assumed
two simple electron density distributions along the LOS (a constant density and
Gaussian density profiles) for a plasma blob and synthesized the expected tB
and pB for different distances $z$ of the blob from the plane of the sky (POS)
and different projected altitudes $\rho$. Reconstructed locations of the blob
along the LOS were thus compared with the real ones, allowing a precise
determination of uncertainties in the method. Independently of the analytical
density profile, when the blob is centered at a small distance from the POS
(i.e. for limb CMEs) the distance from the POS starts to be significantly
overestimated. Polarization ratio technique provides the LOS position of the
center of mass of what we call folded density distribution, given by reflecting
and summing in front of the POS the fraction of density profile located behind
that plane. On the other hand, when the blob is far from the POS, but with very
small projected altitudes (i.e. for halo CMEs, $\rho < 1.4$ R$_\odot$), the
inferred distance from that plane is significantly underestimated. Better
determination of the real blob position along the LOS is given for intermediate
locations, and in particular when the blob is centered at an angle of
$20^\circ$ from the POS. These result have important consequences not only for
future 3D reconstruction of CMEs with polarization ratio technique, but also
for the design of future coronagraphs aimed at providing a continuous
monitoring of halo-CMEs for space weather prediction purposes.

III, at low pressure (0.2-0.8 GPa), transform into phase II, which has a
monazite-type structure. At room temperature, this polymorph is stable up to
31.5 GPa. Calculations support these findings and predict the occurrence of an
additional transition from the monoclinic monazite-type to a tetragonal
scheelite-type structure (phase IV). This transition was experimentally found
after the simultaneous application of pressure (28 GPa) and temperature (1500

kinetic barriers. Calculations also predict an additional phase transition at

topological cyclic homology $TC$. First, we categorify the category of schemes
to the $(2, \infty)$-category of noncommuatative schemes a la Kontsevich. This
gives a categorification of the set of rational points of a scheme. Then, we
categorify the Crystalline Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula and find an
analogue to the Crystalline cohomology in the setting of noncommuative schemes
over $\mathbf{F}_{p}$. Our analogy suggests the existence of a categorification
of the $l$-adic cohomology trace formula in the noncommutative setting for
$l\neq p$. Finally, we write down the corresponding dictionary.

observational diagrams and on a comparison of photoionization models with
well-chosen emission-line ratio diagrams. We show that spectral energy
distributions from current stellar population synthesis models cannot account

is achieved by a theorem connecting computations on a kind of randomized
decision trees and sampling based algorithms. This approach is surprisingly
powerful, and applicable to several models of computation previously studied.
  As a first illustration we show how all the results of Evans and Pippenger
(SIAM J. Computing, 1999) for noisy decision trees, some of which were derived
using Fourier analysis, follow immediately if we consider the sampling-based
algorithms that naturally arise from these decision trees.
  Next, we show a tight lower bound of $\Omega(N \log\log N)$ on the number of
transmissions required to compute several functions (including the parity
function and the majority function) in a network of $N$ randomly placed
sensors, communicating using local transmissions, and operating with power near
the connectivity threshold. This result considerably simplifies and strengthens
an earlier result of Dutta, Kanoria Manjunath and Radhakrishnan (SODA 08) that
such networks cannot compute the parity function reliably with significantly
fewer than $N\log \log N$ transmissions. The lower bound for parity shown
earlier made use of special properties of the parity function and is
inapplicable, e.g., to the majority function. In this paper, we use our
approach to develop an interesting connection between computation of boolean
functions on noisy networks that make few transmissionss, and algorithms that
work by sampling only a part of the input. It is straightforward to verify that
such sampling-based algorithms cannot compute the majority function.

machine learning problems. In particular, the well known kernel density
estimator and the kernel mean embedding both have the form of a kernel mean.
Unfortunately, kernel means are faced with scalability issues. A single point
evaluation of the kernel density estimator, for example, requires a computation
time linear in the training sample size. To address this challenge, we present
a method to efficiently construct a sparse approximation of a kernel mean. We
do so by first establishing an incoherence-based bound on the approximation
error, and then noticing that, for the case of radial kernels, the bound can be
minimized by solving the $k$-center problem. The outcome is a linear time
construction of a sparse kernel mean, which also lends itself naturally to an
automatic sparsity selection scheme. We show the computational gains of our
method by looking at three problems involving kernel means: Euclidean embedding
of distributions, class proportion estimation, and clustering using the
mean-shift algorithm.

work we focus on large markets: ones in which the demand of each buyer is
infinitesimally small compared to the size of the overall market. We assume
that the buyer valuations for the items they desire have a nice (although
reasonable) structure, i.e., that the aggregate buyer demand has a monotone
hazard rate and that the values of every buyer type come from the same support.
  For such large markets, our main contribution is a 1.88 approximation
algorithm for maximizing revenue, showing that good pricing schemes can be
computed when the number of buyers is large. We also give a (e,2)-bicriteria
algorithm that simultaneously approximates both maximum revenue and welfare,
thus showing that it is possible to obtain both good revenue and welfare at the
same time. We further generalize our results by relaxing some of our
assumptions, and quantify the necessary tradeoffs between revenue and welfare
in our setting. Our results are the first known approximations for large
markets, and crucially rely on new lower bounds which we prove for the
revenue-maximizing prices.

dynamic interstellar environment that is presently characterized by Mach 1
motion between the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM).
The interaction between the heliosphere and ISM is an evolving process due to
the variable solar wind and to interstellar turbulence. Frisch et al. presented
a meta-analysis of the historical data on the interstellar wind flowing through
the heliosphere and concluded that temporal changes in the ecliptic longitude
of the wind were statistically indicated by the data available in the refereed
literature at the time of that writing. Lallement and Bertaux disagree with
this result, and suggested, for instance, that a key instrumental response
function of IBEX-Lo was incorrect and that the STEREO pickup ion data are
unsuitable for diagnosing the flow of interstellar neutrals through the
heliosphere. Here we show that temporal variations in the interstellar wind
through the heliosphere are consistent with our knowledge of local ISM. The
statistical analysis of the historical helium wind data is revisited, and a
recent correction of a typographical error in the literature is incorporated
into the new fits. With this correction, and including no newer IBEX results,
these combined data still indicate that a change in the longitude of the
interstellar neutral wind over the past forty years is statistically likely,
but that a constant flow longitude is now also statistically possible. It is
shown that the IBEX instrumental response function is known, and that the
STEREO pickup ion data have been correctly utilized in this analysis.

numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. These implicit large eddy

including the Kolmogorov cascade. We use the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
(RANS) formulation to make concise the 3D simulation data, and use the 3D
simulations to give closure for the RANS equations. We further analyze this
data set with a simple analytical model, which is non-local and time-dependent,
and which contains both MLT and the Lorenz convective roll as particular
subsets of solutions. A characteristic length (the damping length) again
emerges in the simulations; it is determined by an observed balance between (1)
the large-scale driving, and (2) small-scale damping.
  The nature of mixing and convective boundaries is analyzed, including
dynamic, thermal and compositional effects, and compared to a simple model.
  We find that
  (1) braking regions (boundary layers in which mixing occurs) automatically
appear {\it beyond} the edges of convection as defined by the Schwarzschild
criterion,
  (2) dynamic (non-local) terms imply a non-zero turbulent kinetic energy flux
(unlike MLT),
  (3) the effects of composition gradients on flow can be comparable to thermal
effects, and
  (4) convective boundaries in neutrino-cooled stages differ in nature from
those in photon-cooled stages (different P\'eclet numbers).
  The algorithms are based upon ILES solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations,
so that, unlike MLT, they do not require any calibration to astronomical
systems in order to predict stellar properties. Implications for solar
abundances, helioseismology, asteroseismology, nucleosynthesis yields,
supernova progenitors and core collapse are indicated.

6.7+-11 degrees of the observed upwind direction of the flow of interstellar
neutral helium gas through the heliosphere. (2) The magnetic field is ordered;
the component of the variation of the polarization position angles that can be

universe are believed to give rise to temperature anisotropies and polarization
patterns in the CMB radiation. These have been observed by satellites such as
COBE, WMAP, and PLANCK, and by bolometric instruments placed near the South
Pole by the BICEP collaborations. The expected temperature anisotropies are
well-confirmed. The B-mode polarization patterns in the CMB are currently under
measurement jointly by the PLANCK and BICEP groups to determine the extent to
which the B-modes can be attributed to gravitational waves from the creation of
gravitons in the earliest universe. It was during 1962 that I proved that
quanta of the minimally-coupled scalar field were created by the general
expanding FLRW universe. This was relevant also to the creation of quantized
perturbations of the gravitational field, since these perturbations satisfied
linear field equations that could be quantized in the same way as the
minimally-coupled scalar field equation. In fact, in 1946, E.M. Lifshitz had
considered the classical Einstein gravitational field in FLRW expanding
universes and had shown that the classical linearized Einstein field equations
reduced, in what is now known as the Lifshitz gauge, to two separate classical
minimally-coupled massless scalar field equations. These field equations of
Lifshitz, when quantized, correspond to the field equations for massless
gravitons, one equation for each of the two independent polarization components
of the spin-2 massless graviton. I will discuss this further in this article.1

information about each individual's contribution to a piece of joint work. We
argue that in prior network analyses of coauthorship networks, the information

typically symmetrized. This is basically the same as assuming that each
co-author has contributed equally to a paper. We introduce a solution to this
problem by adopting a coauthorship credit allocation model proposed by Kim and
Diesner (2014), which in its core conceptualizes co-authoring as a directed,
weighted, and self-looped network. We test and validate our application of the
adopted framework based on a sample data of 861 authors who have published in
the journal Psychometrika. Results suggest that this novel sociometric approach
can complement traditional measures based on undirected networks and expand

summarising the dissimilarity, or 'incongruence', of two or more phylogenetic
trees. Many of these measures are NP-hard to compute and this has stimulated a
considerable volume of research into fixed parameter tractable algorithms. In
this article we use Monadic Second Order logic (MSOL) to give alternative,
compact proofs of fixed parameter tractability for several well-known
incongruency measures. In doing so we wish to demonstrate the considerable
potential of MSOL - machinery still largely unknown outside the algorithmic
graph theory community - within phylogenetics. A crucial component of this work
is the observation that many of these measures, when bounded, imply the
existence of an 'agreement forest' of bounded size, which in turn implies that
an auxiliary graph structure, the display graph, has bounded treewidth. It is
this bound on treewidth that makes the machinery of MSOL available for proving
fixed parameter tractability. We give a variety of different MSOL formulations.
Some are based on explicitly encoding agreement forests, while some only use
them implicitly to generate the treewidth bound. Our formulations introduce a
number of ""phylogenetics MSOL primitives"" which will hopefully be of use to
other researchers.

reflects the space-time nonlocality of the isovector nuclear interaction. It
affects the neutron/proton ratio during the earlier evolution of the Universe,
cooling of protoneutron stars, structure of rare isotopes and dynamics of
heavy-ion collisions. While there is still no consensus on whether the
neutron-proton effective mass splitting is negative, zero or positive and how
it depends on the density as well as the isospin-asymmetry of the medium,
significant progress has been made in recent yeas in addressing these issues.
We first recall the connections among the neutron-proton effective mass
splitting, the momentum dependence of the isovector potential and the density
dependence of the symmetry energy. We then make a few observations about the
progress in calculating the neutron-proton effective mass splitting using
various nuclear many-body theories and its effects on the isospin-dependence of
in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections. Perhaps, our most reliable knowledge
so far about the neutron-proton effective mass splitting at saturation density
of nuclear matter comes from optical model analyses of huge sets of
nucleon-nucleus scattering data accumulated over the last five decades. The
momentum dependence of the symmetry potential from these analyses provide a
useful boundary condition at saturation density for calibrating nuclear
many-body calculations. Several observables in heavy-ion collisions have been
identified as sensitive probes of the neutron-proton effective mass splitting
in dense neutron-rich matter based on transport model simulations. We review
these observables and comment on the latest experimental findings.

explicitly study the effect of the charge-density-wave (CDW) order parameter
with a $d$-wave form factor with the experimentally observed modulation $(\pm
Q_0,0)$ and $(0,\pm Q_0)$ at the infrared-stable nontrivial fixed point
obtained previously for this model. Additionally, we proceed to investigate
also the so-called pair-density-wave (PDW) order that was recently proposed in
the literature as a possible candidate for the ""hidden"" order to describe the
pseudogap phase observed in underdoped cuprates. We confirm that although the
above two ordering tendencies are also found to be nearly degenerate both at
one-loop and two-loop RG orders and linked by an emergent $SU(2)$ pseudospin
symmetry, they turn out to be subleading for weaker couplings in the present
model to antiferromagnetism, $d$-wave bond-density wave (BDW) order with
modulation along Brillouin zone diagonals $(\pm Q_0,\pm Q_0)$, and $d$-wave
singlet superconductivity (SSC). However, as we increase the strength of the
initial coupling towards moderate values, we do capture a tendency for the
entangled PDW/CDW order to become leading compared to BDW/SSC in the model,
which suggests that the former composite order might be indeed a viable concept
to describe some cuprate superconductors at high temperatures in the underdoped
regime, as has been recently alluded to by many authors in the literature.

which has been established as a reliable means for a wide variety of
applications, including molecular separation, detection, crystallization and
biosynthesis. Although atomic and molecular level consideration is a key
ingredient in experimental design and fabrication of nanfluidic systems, atomic
and molecular modeling of nanofluidics is rare and most simulations at
nanoscale are restricted to one- or two-dimensions in the literature, to our
best knowledge. The present work introduces atomic scale design and
three-dimensional (3D) simulation of ionic diffusive nanofluidic systems. We
propose a variational multiscale framework to represent the nanochannel in
discrete atomic and/or molecular detail while describe the ionic solution by
continuum. Apart from the major electrostatic and entropic effects, the
non-electrostatic interactions between the channel and solution, and among
solvent molecules are accounted in our modeling. We derive generalized
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for nanofluidic systems. Mathematical
algorithms, such as Dirichlet to Neumann mapping and the matched interface and
boundary (MIB) methods are developed to rigorously solve the aforementioned
equations to the second-order accuracy in 3D realistic settings. Three ionic
diffusive nanofluidic systems, including a negatively charged nanochannel, a
bipolar nanochannel and a double-well nanochannel are designed to investigate
the impact of atomic charges to channel current, density distribution and
electrostatic potential. Numerical findings, such as gating, ion depletion and
inversion, are in good agreements with those from experimental measurements and
numerical simulations in the literature.

potential structures in collisionless plasmas. These are vortex-like structures
in the electron phase space. Its existence is cause of distortion of the
electron distribution in the resonant region. These are explained theoretically
first time by Schamel et.al [Phys. Scr. 20, 336 (1979) and Phys. Plasmas 19,
020501 (2012)]. Propagating solitary electron holes can also be formed in a
laboratory plasma when a fast rising high positive voltage pulse is applied to
a metallic electrode [Kar et. al., Phys. Plasmas 17, 102113 (2010)] immersed in
a low pressure plasma. The temporal evolution of these structures can be
studied by measuring the transient electron distribution function (EDF). In the
present work, transient EDF is measured after formation of a solitary electron
hole in nearly uniform, unmagnetized, and collisionless plasma for applied
pulse width and, where and are applied pulse width and inverse of ion plasma
frequency respectively. For both type of pulse widths, double hump like profile
of transient EDF is observed, indicating that solitary electron hole exists in
the system for time periods longer than the applied pulse duration. The beam
(or free) electrons along with trapped (or bulk) electrons gives the solution
of SEHs in the plasma. Without free or beam electrons, no SEHs exist. Transient
EDF measurements reveal the existence and evolution of SEHs in the plasma.
Measurements show that these structures live in system for longer time in the
low pressure range. In high pressure cases, only single hump like transient EDF
is observed i.e. only trapped or bulk electrons. In this situation, SEH does
not exist in the plasma during evolution of plasma after the end of applied

approach to perihelion. Discovered inbound at 4.2 AU, this long-period comet
was predicted to become very bright when near perihelion, at 0.48 AU on 2011
September 10. Observations starting 2011 February (heliocentric distance
$\sim$3.5 AU) indeed show the comet to brighten by about 11 magnitudes, with
most of the increase occurring inside 1 AU from the Sun. The peak brightness
reached $m_R$ = 6 on UT 2011 August 12.95$\pm$0.50, when at $\sim$0.83 AU from
the Sun. We find that most of the surge in brightness in mid-August resulted
from dust particle forward-scattering, not from a sudden increase in the
activity. A much smaller ($\sim$3 magnitudes) brightening reached a maximum on
UT 2011 August 30$\pm$1 (at 0.56 AU), and reflects the true break-up of the
nucleus. This second peak was matched by a change in the morphology from
centrally condensed to diffuse. The estimated cross-section of the nucleus when
at 1 AU inbound was $\sim$1 km$^2$, corresponding to an equal-area circle of
radius 0.6 km. No surviving fragments were found to a limiting red magnitude
$r'$ = 24.4, corresponding to radii $\lesssim$40 m (red geometric albedo = 0.04
assumed). Our observations are consistent with disintegration of the nucleus
into a power law size distribution of fragments with index $q$ = 3.3$\pm$0.2
combined with the action of radiation pressure. We speculate about physical
processes that might cause nucleus disruption in a comet when still 0.7 AU from
the Sun. Tidal stresses and devolatilization of the nucleus by sublimation are
both negligible at this distance. However, the torque caused by mass loss, even
at the very low rates measured in comet Elenin, is potentially large enough to
be responsible by driving the nucleus to rotational instability.

quantum matter: insulators, density waves, and superconductors have very
different gap structures. The momentum resolved nature of angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize
spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic
d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition temperature (Tc)
cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave
superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous
gap above Tc, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The
nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with
superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To
address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping, and materials dependence
of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved
instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article
overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic
phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase
transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic
symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum and temperature dependent
fingerprints reflecting an intertwined & competing relationship between the
ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple
phenomenologically-distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome.

radicals, and X2O and HDO molecules following photodissociation of H2O, D2O,
and HDO in H2O amorphous ice at temperatures from 10-100 K. Isotope effects are
found for all products: (1) H atom photodesorption probabilities from H2O ice
are larger than those for D atom photodesorption from D2O ice by a factor of
1.1; the ratio of H and D photodesorbed upon HDO photodissociation is a factor
of 2. This process will enrich the ice in deuterium atoms over time; (2) the
OD/OH photodesorption ratio upon D2O and H2O photodissociation is on average a
factor of 2, but the ratio upon HDO photodissociation is almost constant at
unity for all temperatures; (3) D atoms are more effective in kicking out
neighbouring water molecules than H atoms. However, the ratio of the
photodesorbed HDO and H2O molecules is equal to the HDO/H2O ratio in the ice,
therefore, there is no isotope fractionation upon HDO and H2O photodesorption.
Nevertheless, the enrichment of the ice in D atoms due to photodesorption can
over time lead to an enhanced HDO/H2O ratio in the ice, and, when
photodesorbed, also in the gas. The extent to which the ortho/para ratio of H2O
can be modified by the photodesorption process is also discussed. (Abridged)

schedule in the context of the linear-quadratic model. Our interest arises from
the observation that if inter-patient variations in OAR and tumor sensitivities
to radiation or sparing factor of the OAR are not accounted for during
radiation scheduling, the performance of the therapy may be strongly degraded
or the OAR may receive a substantially larger dose than the maximum threshold.
This paper proposes two radiation scheduling concepts to incorporate
inter-patient variability into the scheduling optimization problem. The first
approach is a robust formulation that formulates the problem as a conservative
model that optimizes the worst case dose scheduling that may occur. The second
method is a probabilistic approach, where the model parameters are given by a
set of random variables. This formulation insures that our constraints are
satisfied with a given probability, and that our objective function achieves a
desired level with a stated probability. We used a transformation to reduce the
resulting optimization problem to two dimensions. We showed that the optimal
solution lies on the boundary of the feasible region and we used a branch and
bound algorithm to find the global optimal solution. We observed that if the
number of fractions in the optimal conventional schedule is the same as the
robust and stochastic solutions, it is preferable to administer equal or
smaller total dose. In addition if there exist more (fewer) treatment sessions
in the probabilistic or robust solution compared to the conventional schedule,
a reduction in total dose squared (total dose) will be expected. Finally, we
performed numerical experiments in the setting of head-and-neck tumors to
reveal the effect of parameter uncertainty on optimal schedules and to evaluate
the sensitivity of the model to the choice of key model parameters.

that provides a least squares fit to frequency response measurements. In an
earlier work, we provided an analysis of VF for scalar-valued rational
functions and established a connection with optimal $H_2$ approximation. We
build on this work and extend the previous framework to include the
construction of effective rational approximations to matrix-valued functions, a
problem which presents significant challenges that do not appear in the scalar
case. Transfer functions associated with multi-input/multi-output (MIMO)
dynamical systems typify the class of functions that we consider here. Others
have also considered extensions of VF to matrix-valued functions and related
numerical implementations are readily available. However to our knowledge, a
detailed analysis of numerical issues that arise does not yet exist. We offer
such an analysis including critical implementation details here.
  One important issue that arises for VF on matrix-valued functions that has
remained largely unaddressed is the control of the McMillan degree of the
resulting rational approximant; the McMillan degree can grow very high in the
case of large input/output dimensions. We introduce two new mechanisms for
controlling the McMillan degree of the final approximant, one based on
alternating least-squares minimization and one based on ancillary
system-theoretic reduction methods. Motivated in part by our earlier work on
the scalar VF problem as well as by recent innovations for computing optimal
$H_2$ approximation, we establish a connection with optimal $H_2$
approximation, and are able to improve significantly the fidelity of VF through
numerical quadrature, with virtually no increase in cost or complexity. We
provide several numerical examples to support the theoretical discussion and
proposed algorithms.

with a Curie temperature of 106 K. Monolayers of Mn-compounds ($\text{MnPS}_3$

of Cd3As2 nanowires and nanobelts and a systematic investigation of their
magnetotransport properties. Temperature-dependent ambipolar behavior is
evidently demonstrated, suggesting the presence of finite-size of bandgap in
nanowires. Cd3As2 nanobelts, however, exhibit metallic characteristics with a
high carrier mobility exceeding 32,000 cm2V-1s-1 and pronounced anomalous
double-period Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. Unlike the bulk
counterpart, the Cd3As2 nanobelts reveal the possibility of unusual change of
the Fermi sphere owing to the suppression of the dimensionality. More
importantly, their SdH oscillations can be effectively tuned by the gate
voltage. The successful synthesis of Cd3As2 nanostructures and their rich

statistics and learning theory. Given samples coming from a random one out of k
Gaussian distributions in Rn, the learning problem asks to estimate the means
and the covariance matrices of these Gaussians. This learning problem arises in
many areas ranging from the natural sciences to the social sciences, and has
also found many machine learning applications. Unfortunately, learning mixture
of Gaussians is an information theoretically hard problem: in order to learn
the parameters up to a reasonable accuracy, the number of samples required is
exponential in the number of Gaussian components in the worst case. In this
work, we show that provided we are in high enough dimensions, the class of
Gaussian mixtures is learnable in its most general form under a smoothed
analysis framework, where the parameters are randomly perturbed from an
adversarial starting point. In particular, given samples from a mixture of
Gaussians with randomly perturbed parameters, when n > {\Omega}(k^2), we give
an algorithm that learns the parameters with polynomial running time and using
polynomial number of samples. The central algorithmic ideas consist of new ways
to decompose the moment tensor of the Gaussian mixture by exploiting its
structural properties. The symmetries of this tensor are derived from the
combinatorial structure of higher order moments of Gaussian distributions
(sometimes referred to as Isserlis' theorem or Wick's theorem). We also develop
new tools for bounding smallest singular values of structured random matrices,
which could be useful in other smoothed analysis settings.

critical role on shaping the spin of supermassive massive black holes (SMBHs)
through the Bardeen-Petterson effect, a general relativistic effect that leads
to final alignments or anti-alignments between black holes and warped accretion
disks. We study such alignment processes by explicitly taking into account the
finite sizes of accretion disks and the episodic lifetimes of AGNs that
delineate the duration of gas fueling onto accretion disks. We employ an
approximate global model to simulate the evolution of accretion disks, allowing
to determine the gravitomagnetic torque that drives the alignments in a quite
simple way. We then track down the evolutionary paths for mass and spin of
black holes both in a single activity episode and over a series of episodes.
Given with randomly and isotropically oriented gas fueling over episodes, we
calculate the spin evolution with different episodic lifetimes and find that it
is quite sensitive to the lifetimes. We therefore propose that spin
distribution of SMBHs can place constraints on the episodic lifetimes of AGNs
and vice versa. Applications of our results on the observed spin distributions
of SMBHs and the observed episodic lifetimes of AGNs are discussed, although
both the measurements at present are yet ambiguous to draw a firm conclusion.
Our prescription can be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models for black
hole growth and spin evolution.

However, it is often impractical, if not infeasible, to reconstruct full-range
Nyquist samples because of huge storage and computational load requirements.
Based on the analyses of AIC measurement system, this paper develops a novel
segment-sliding reconstruction (SegSR) scheme to effectively reconstruct the
Nyquist samples. The SegSR per- forms segment-by-segment reconstruction in a
sliding mode and can be implemented in real-time. An important characteristic
that distinguish the proposed SegSR from the existing methods is that the
measurement matrix in each segment satisfies the restricted isometry property
(RIP) condition. Partial support in the previous segment can be incorporated
into the estimation of the Nyquist samples in the current segment. The effect
of interference intro- duced from adjacent segments is theoretically analyzed,
and it is revealed that the interference consists of two interference levels
having different impacts to the signal reconstruction performance. With these
observations, a two-step orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure is
proposed for segment reconstruction, which takes into account different
interference levels and partially known support of the previous segment. The
proposed SegSR achieves nearly optimal reconstruction performance with a signi-
ficant reduction of computational loads and storage requirements. Theoretical
analyses and simulations verify its effectiveness.

acquiring in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components in radar. In this scheme,
the received intermediate frequency (IF) signals are expressed as a linear
combination of time-delayed and scaled replicas of the transmitted waveforms.
For sparse IF signals on discrete grids of time-delay space, the QuadCS can
efficiently reconstruct the I/Q components from sub-Nyquist samples. In
practice, the signals are characterized by a set of unknown time-delay
parameters in a continuous space. Then conventional sparse signal
reconstruction will deteriorate the QuadCS reconstruction performance. This
paper focuses on the reconstruction of the I/Q components with continuous delay
parameters. A parametric spectrum-matched dictionary is defined, which sparsely
describes the IF signals in the frequency domain by delay parameters and gain
coefficients, and the QuadCS system is reexamined under the new dictionary.
With the inherent structure of the QuadCS system, it is found that the
estimation of delay parameters can be decoupled from that of sparse gain
coefficients, yielding a beamspace direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation
formulation with a time-varying beamforming matrix. Then an interpolated
beamspace DOA method is developed to perform the DOA estimation. An optimal
interpolated array is established and sufficient conditions to guarantee the
successful estimation of the delay parameters are derived. With the estimated
delays, the gain coefficients can be conveniently determined by solving a
linear least-squares problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed algorithm in reconstructing the sparse signals with
continuous delay parameters.

explosions, but, while in LGRBs the ultra-relativistic jet emerges from the
bare progenitor star and produces the observed gamma-rays, in llgrbs the
extended envelope smothers the jet and prevents the generation of a large
gamma-ray luminosity. Instead, the jet deposits all its energy in the envelope,
driving a mildly relativistic shock that upon breakout produces a llgrb. In
addition for giving a unified view of the two phenomena, this model provides a
natural explanation to many observed properties of llgrbs. It also implies that
llgrbs are a viable source of the observed extra-galactic diffuse neutrino flux
and that they are promising sources for future gravitational wave detectors.

surprise, which assesses the quality of the partition of a network into

difficult to analyze. We here therefore develop an accurate asymptotic
approximation. This allows for the development of an efficient algorithm for
optimizing surprise. Incidentally, this leads to a straightforward extension of
surprise to weighted graphs. Additionally, the approximation makes it possible
to analyze surprise more closely and compare it to other methods, especially
modularity. We show that surprise is (nearly) unaffected by the well known
resolution limit, a particular problem for modularity. However, surprise may
tend to overestimate the number of communities, whereas they may be
underestimated by modularity. In short, surprise works well in the limit of
many small communities, whereas modularity works better in the limit of few
large communities. In this sense, surprise is more discriminative than
modularity, and may find communities where modularity fails to discern any
structure.

random edges connecting remote nodes. The probability of connecting a node $u$
with node $v$ through a weak tie is proportional to $1/|uv|^\alpha$, where
$|uv|$ is the grid distance between $u$ and $v$ and $\alpha\ge 0$ is the
parameter of the model. Complex contagion refers to the propagation mechanism
in a network where each node is activated only after $k \ge 2$ neighbors of the
node are activated.
  In this paper, we propose the concept of routing of complex contagion (or
complex routing), where we can activate one node at one time step with the goal
of activating the targeted node in the end. We consider decentralized routing
scheme where only the weak ties from the activated nodes are revealed. We study
the routing time of complex contagion and compare the result with simple
routing and complex diffusion (the diffusion of complex contagion, where all
nodes that could be activated are activated immediately in the same step with
the goal of activating all nodes in the end).
  We show that for decentralized complex routing, the routing time is lower
bounded by a polynomial in $n$ (the number of nodes in the network) for all
range of $\alpha$ both in expectation and with high probability (in particular,
$\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha+2}})$ for $\alpha \le 2$ and
$\Omega(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2(\alpha+2)}})$ for $\alpha > 2$ in expectation),
while the routing time of simple contagion has polylogarithmic upper bound when
$\alpha = 2$. Our results indicate that complex routing is harder than complex
diffusion and the routing time of complex contagion differs exponentially

quantify the statistical dependence between the velocity components of the FEM.
Here we investigate the dependence between horizontal and vertical velocity

The results are compared with computer-generated surrogate time series

traditional tools to extract useful analysis for decision-making. By
integrating high-dimensional analysis with visualization, this paper develops a
3D power-map animation as an effective solution to the challenge. An
architecture design, with detailed data processing procedure, is proposed to
realize the integration. Two of the most important components in the
architecture are presented: the Single-Ring Law for random matrices as solid
mathematic foundation, and the proposed statistical index MSR as
high-dimensional data for visualization. The whole procedure is easy in logic,
fast in speed, objective and even robust against bad data. Moreover, it is an
unsupervised machine learning mechanism directly oriented to the raw data
rather than logics or models based on simplifications and assumptions. A case
study validates the effectiveness and performance of the developed 3D power-map
in analysis extraction.

guiding principle. In conventional superconductors, electrons pair up into
Cooper pairs via the retarded attraction mediated by electron-phonon coupling.
Higher-frequency phonon (or smaller atomic mass) leads to higher
superconducting transition temperature, known as the isotope effect.
Furthermore, superconductivity is the only instability channel of the metallic
normal state. In correlated systems, the above simple scenario could be easily
violated. The strong local interaction is poorly screened, and this conspires
with a featured Fermi surface to promote various competing electronic orders,
such as spin-density-wave, charge-density-wave and unconventional
superconductivity. On top of the various phases, the effect of electron-phonon
coupling is an intriguing issue. Using the functional renormalization group,
here we investigated the interplay between the electron correlation and
electron-phonon coupling in a prototype Hubbard-Holstein model on a square
lattice. At half-filling, we found spin-density-wave and charge-density-wave
phases and the transition between them, while no superconducting phase arises.
Upon finite doping, d-wave/s-wave superconductivity emerges in proximity to
spin-density-wave/charge-density-wave phases. Surprisingly, lower-frequency
Holstein-phonons are either less destructive, or even beneficial, to the
various phases, resulting in a negative isotope effect. We discuss the
underlying mechanism behind and the implications of such anomalous effects.

Ethernet is widely used in readout system design of modern particle physics
experiments. However, Ethernet is usually used together with TCP/IP protocol
stack, which makes it difficult to be implemented because designers have to use
operating system to process this protocol. Furthermore, TCP/IP protocol
degrades the transmission efficiency and real-time performance. To maximize the
performance of Ethernet in physics experiment applications, a data readout
method based on physical layer (PHY) is proposed in this paper. In this method,
TCP/IP protocol is forsaken and replaced with a customized and simple protocol,
which make it easier to be implemented. On each readout module, data from
front-end electronics is first fed into an FPGA for protocol processing and
then sent out to a PHY chip controlled by this FPGA for transmission. This kind
of data path is fully implemented by hardware. While from the side of data
acquisition system (DAQ), absence of standard protocol makes the network
related applications panic. To solve this problem, in the operating system
kernel space, data received by network interface card is drawn away from the
traditional flow and redirected to a specified memory space by a customized
program. This memory space can be easily accessed by applications in user
space. For the purpose of verification, a prototype system is designed and
implemented. Preliminary test result shows that this method can meet the
requirement of data transmission from readout module to DAQ with good
efficiency and simplicity.

one where this flux is governed by first-order kinetics with a specified
distribution of rate constant. We employ a macroscale model where the
short-range interaction of the solute with the particle boundary is represented
by an effective slip condition. The solute transport is governed by an
advection-diffusion equation.
  We focus upon the singular limit of large P\'eclet numbers, $Pe\gg 1$. In the
fixed-flux model, the excess-solute concentration is confined to a narrow
boundary layer. The scaling pertinent to that limit allows to decouple the
problem governing the solute concentration from the flow field. The resulting
nonlinear boundary-layer problem is handled using a transformation to
stream-function coordinates and a subsequent application of Fourier transforms,
and is thereby reduced to a nonlinear integral equation governing the
interfacial concentration. Its solution provides the requisite approximation
for the particle velocity, which scales as $Pe^{-1/3}$.
  In the fixed-rate model, large P\'eclet numbers may be realized in different
limit processes. We consider the case of large swimmers or strong reaction,
where the Damk\""ohler number $Da$ is large as well, scaling as $Pe$. In that
double limit, where no boundary layer is formed, we obtain a closed-form
approximation for the particle velocity, expressed as a nonlinear functional of

meet the needs of an increasingly complex research landscape. It enables
researchers to verify results and to pursuit new research questions with ""old""
data. It is therefore not surprising that data sharing is advocated by funding
agencies, journals, and researchers alike. We surveyed 2661 individual academic
researchers across all disciplines on their dealings with data, their
publication practices, and motives for sharing or withholding research data.
The results for 1564 valid responses show that researchers across disciplines
recognise the benefit of secondary research data for their own work and for
scientific progress as a whole-still they only practice it in moderation. An
explanation for this evidence could be an academic system that is not driven by
monetary incentives, nor the desire for scientific progress, but by individual
reputation-expressed in (high ranked journal) publications. We label this
system a Reputation Economy. This special economy explains our findings that
show that researchers have a nuanced idea how to provide adequate formal
recognition for making data available to others-namely data citations. We
conclude that data sharing will only be widely adopted among research
professionals if sharing pays in form of reputation. Thus, policy measures that
intend to foster research collaboration need to understand academia as a
reputation economy. Successful measures must value intermediate products, such
as research data, more highly than it is the case now.

does not alter the relaxation dynamics of the gaseous magnon phase. This

emitted from accelerated particles in the magnetosphere. These curvature
photons are detected as pulsed $\gamma$-ray emissions from pulsars with age

impose severe constraints on the synchrotron radiation as a mechanism of the
non-thermal X-ray emission. In most middle-aged pulsars ($\sim10^5-10^6$ yr)
which photon-photon pair production is less efficient in their magnetosphere,
we find that the synchrotron radiation model is difficult to explain the

randomized function of $X$. Provided that $Z$ is short, one can make this
function computationally efficient by allowing it to be only approximately
correct. In folklore this problem is known as \emph{simulating auxiliary
inputs}. This idea of simulating auxiliary information turns out to be a
powerful tool in computer science, finding applications in complexity theory,
cryptography, pseudorandomness and zero-knowledge. In this paper we revisit
this problem, achieving the following results:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)] We discuss and compare efficiency of known results,
finding the flaw in the best known bound claimed in the TCC'14 paper ""How to
Fake Auxiliary Inputs"". We present a novel boosting algorithm for constructing
the simulator. Our technique essentially fixes the flaw. This boosting proof is
of independent interest, as it shows how to handle ""negative mass"" issues when
constructing probability measures in descent algorithms. Our bounds are much
better than bounds known so far. To make the simulator
$(s,\epsilon)$-indistinguishable we need the complexity $O\left(s\cdot
2^{5\ell}\epsilon^{-2}\right)$ in time/circuit size, which is better by a
factor $\epsilon^{-2}$ compared to previous bounds. In particular, with our
technique we (finally) get meaningful provable security for the EUROCRYPT'09
leakage-resilient stream cipher instantiated with a standard 256-bit block
cipher, like $\mathsf{AES256}$.

with different genomic variation i.e. clones. For drug responsiveness and
therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample
accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either
computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of
mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of
clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we
propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting
clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific
genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic
location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results
shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity.
Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.

still a challenging problem due to the difficulty to represent two

represent an image ignoring the spatial information, or rely on a

these problems, we propose a novel graphical representation based HFR method

image patches separately, which takes the spatial compatibility between
neighboring image patches into consideration. A coupled representation
similarity metric (CRSM) is designed to measure the similarity between obtained
graphical representations. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple HFR

function by means of a large deviation principle (LDP), and its application to
the estimation of the probability of a multivariate extreme event from a sample
of n iid random vectors, with the probability bounded by powers of sample size
with exponents below -1. One way to view classical tail limits is as limits of
probability ratios. In contrast, the tail LDP provides asymptotic bounds or
limits for log-probability ratios. After standardising the marginals to
standard exponential, dependence is represented by a homogeneous rate function.
Furthermore, the tail LDP can be extended to represent both dependence and
marginals, the latter implying marginal log-GW tail limits. A connection is
established between the tail LDP and residual tail dependence (or hidden
regular variation) and a recent extension of it. Under a smoothness assumption,
they are implied by the tail LDP. Based on the tail LDP, a simple estimator for
very small probabilities of extreme events is formulated. It avoids estimation
of the rate function by making use of its homogeneity. Strong consistency in
the sense of convergence of log-probability ratios is proven. Simulations and
an application illustrate the difference between the classical approach and the
LDP-based approach.

translations without resorting to rotations. As a signature of 1D chirality, we
show that 1D chiral metamaterials support optical activity and we prove that

the goal of increasing the overall labelling accuracy of $\mathcal{D}$, the

suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the

another problem that is also soluble, namely the interaction of Schwinger's
dual-charged (dyon) particles. While the electromagnetic interaction of
magnetic monopoles and electric charges was studied in detail some 40 years
ago, we consider that a pedagogical discussion of it from an essentially
classical mechanics point of view is a useful contribution for students.
Following a path that generalizes Kepler's problem and Rutherford scattering,
we show that they exhibit remarkable properties such as stable non-planar
orbits, as well as rainbow and glory scattering, which are not present in the
ordinary scattering of two singly charged particles. Moreover, it can be
extended further to the relativistic case and to a semi-classical quantization,
which can also be included in the class discussion.

signals from the outside world into neural impulses transmitted along the
auditory pathway for further processing. The cochlea senses and separates sound
in a nonlinear active fashion, exhibiting remarkable sensitivity and frequency
discrimination. Although several electronic models of the cochlea have been
proposed and implemented, none of these are able to reproduce all the
characteristics of the cochlea, including large dynamic range, large gain and
sharp tuning at low sound levels, and low gain and broad tuning at intense
sound levels. Here, we implement the Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators (CAR)
model of the cochlea on an FPGA. CAR represents the basilar membrane filter in
the Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators with Fast-Acting Compression (CAR-FAC)
cochlear model. CAR-FAC is a neuromorphic model of hearing based on a pole-zero
filter cascade model of auditory filtering. It uses simple nonlinear extensions
of conventional digital filter stages that are well suited to FPGA
implementations, so that we are able to implement up to 1224 cochlear sections
on Virtex-6 FPGA to process sound data in real time. The FPGA implementation of
the electronic cochlea described here may be used as a front-end sound analyser
for various machine-hearing applications.

collaboratively to encode sensory stimuli. These neuronal populations are
characterised by a diverse distribution of tuning curves, ensuring that the
entire range of input stimuli is encoded. Based on these principles, we have
designed a neuromorphic system called a Trainable Analogue Block (TAB), which
encodes given input stimuli using a large population of neurons with a
heterogeneous tuning curve profile. Heterogeneity of tuning curves is achieved
using random device mismatches in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) process
and by adding a systematic offset to each hidden neuron. Here, we present
measurement results of a single test cell fabricated in a 65nm technology to
verify the TAB framework. We have mimicked a large population of neurons by
re-using measurement results from the test cell by varying offset. We thus
demonstrate the learning capability of the system for various regression tasks.
The TAB system may pave the way to improve the design of analogue circuits for
commercial applications, by rendering circuits insensitive to random mismatch
that arises due to the manufacturing process.

magnetization measurements performed in a single crystal of low Tc
superconductor, Yb3Rh4Sn13. Fingerprint of a transition from an ordered vortex
lattice a la Bragg glass (BG) phase to a partially-disordered vortex glass (VG)
like phase gets unearthed under the influence of an ac driving force present
inevitably in the isothermal ac susceptibility measurements. In contrast to its
well-known effect of improving the state of spatial order in the vortex matter,
the ac drive is surprisingly found to promote disorder by assisting the BG to
VG transition to occur at a lower field value in this compound. On the other
hand, the isothermal dc magnetization (M-H) scans, devoid of such a driving
force, do not reveal this transition; they instead yield signature of another
order-disorder transition at elevated fields, viz., peak effect (PE), located
substantially above the BG to VG transition observed in the isothermal ac
susceptibility measurements. Further, the evolution of PE feature with
increasing field as observed in isofield ac susceptibility plots indicates
emergence of an ordered vortex configuration (BG) from a disordered phase above
a certain field, H* (~ 4 kOe). Below H*, the vortex matter created via
field-cooling (FC) is found to be better spatially ordered than that prepared
in zero field-cooled (ZFC) mode. This is contrary to the usual behavior
anticipated near the high-field order-disorder transition (PE) wherein a FC
state is supposed to be a supercooled disordered phase and the ZFC state is
comparatively better ordered.

self-dual field theories, their classical vacua being described by the vortex
equations. For local models with structure group ${\rm U}(r)$, we give a
description of the vortex moduli spaces in terms of a fibration over symmetric
products of the base surface $\Sigma$, which we assume to be compact. Then we
show that all these fibrations induce isomorphisms of fundamental groups. A
consequence is that all the moduli spaces of multivortices in this class of
models have abelian fundamental groups. We give an interpretation of this fact
as a no-go theorem for the realization of nonabelions through the ground states
of a supersymmetric version (topological via an A-twist) of these gauged
sigma-models. This analysis is based on a semi-classical approximation of the
QFTs via supersymmetric quantum mechanics on their classical moduli spaces.

the monoid of tied braids and we prove the corresponding theorems of Alexander

resources within their environment. In effect this means that a growth of one
population, needs to be balanced by comparable reduction in populations of
others. In neutral models of biodiversity all populations are assumed to change
incrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here we
propose and model another redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe
collapses of the entire population of a single species freeing up resources for
the remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant e.g. for communities of
bacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused e.g. by invading
bacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an
important role.
  The emergent dynamics of our system is cyclic ""diversity waves"" triggered by
collapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at
the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species
abundances are characterized by a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the
lower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced
species, while the upper peak - species that has not yet collapsed in the
current wave. In most waves both upper and lower peaks are composed of several
smaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term
memory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of
the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7.
We show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in
the rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments,
species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.

do thin disk stars with similar [Fe/H]. We deduce that the thick disk is
composed of lower mass stars than the thin disk. Considering the fact that at a
given metallicity there is a one-to-one relation between stellar mass and age,
we are then able to infer the chronology of disk formation. Both the thick and
the thin disks - defined by [$\alpha$/Fe] -- converge in their dependance on
[C/N] and [C+N/Fe] at [Fe/H]$\approx$-0.7. We conclude that 1) the majority of

been lower than in the thick disk, at all metallicities. Although these general
conclusions remain robust, we also show that current stellar evolution models
cannot reproduce the observed C/N ratios for thick disk stars. Unexpectedly,
reduced or inhibited canonical extra-mixing is very common in field stars.
While subject to abundance calibration zeropoint uncertainties, this implies a
strong dependence of non canonical extra-mixing along the red giant branch on

gives the same trivial results). Remarkably, the largest improvement in
performance with respect to the other methods employed is found in the case of
benchmarks with meshes, where the validity hypothesis behind message-passing is
expected to worsen. In these cases, even though the exact message-passing
equations do not converge, by introducing a reinforcement parameter to force
convergence towards a sub optimal solution, we were able to always outperform
the other algorithms with a peak of 27% performance improvement in terms of
accommodated paths. On random graphs, we numerically observe two separated
regimes: one in which all paths can be accommodated and one in which this is
not possible. We also investigate the behaviour of both the number of paths to

functional materials and may serve as models for biological structures.
Mutually attractive nanoparticles that are deformable due to flexible surface
groups, for example, may spontaneously order themselves into strings, sheets
and large vesicles. Furthermore, anisotropic colloids with attractive patches
can self-assemble into open lattices and colloidal equivalents of molecules and
micelles. However, model systems that combine mutual attraction, anisotropy,
and deformability have---to the best of our knowledge---not been realized.
Here, we synthesize colloidal particles that combine these three
characteristics and obtain self-assembled microcapsules. We propose that mutual
attraction and deformability induce directional interactions via colloidal bond
hybridization. Our particles contain both mutually attractive and repulsive
surface groups that are flexible. Analogous to the simplest chemical bond,
where two isotropic orbitals hybridize into the molecular orbital of H2, these
flexible groups redistribute upon binding. Via colloidal bond hybridization,
isotropic spheres self-assemble into planar monolayers, while anisotropic
snowman-like particles self-assemble into hollow monolayer microcapsules. A
modest change of the building blocks thus results in a significant leap in the
complexity of the self-assembled structures. In other words, these relatively
simple building blocks self-assemble into dramatically more complex structures
than similar particles that are isotropic or non-deformable.

electromagnetically coupled oscillations of free electrons at metal-dielectric

either along the groove axis or normal to the planar surface, and channelled
plasmon polaritons (CPPs) that occupy the tapered groove profile and propagate
exclusively along the groove axis. Both GSPs and CPPs exhibit an assortment of

the problem of determining the mean time needed to arrive at a given location
for the first time, the so called mean first passage time (MFPT) problem. The
occurrence of occasional large jumps or intermittent patterns combining various
types of motion are known to outperform the standard random walk with respect
to the MFPT, by reducing oversampling of space. Here we show that a regular but
spatially heterogeneous random walk can significantly and universally enhance
the search in any spatial dimension. In a generic minimal model we consider a
spherically symmetric system comprising two concentric regions with piece-wise
constant diffusivity. The MFPT is analyzed under the constraint of conserved
average dynamics, that is, the spatially averaged diffusivity is kept constant.
Our analytical calculations and extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the
existence of an {\em optimal heterogeneity} minimizing the MFPT to the target.
We prove that the MFPT for a random walk is completely dominated by what we
term direct trajectories towards the target and reveal a remarkable
universality of the spatially heterogeneous search with respect to target size
and system dimensionality. In contrast to intermittent strategies, which are
most profitable in low spatial dimensions, the spatially inhomogeneous search
performs best in higher dimensions. Discussing our results alongside recent
experiments on single particle tracking in living cells we argue that the

rather broad parameter regime. Thus, a simple yet accurate tool to estimate the
sound velocity across coupling regimes is proposed, which can be particularly
helpful in estimating the dust-acoustic velocity in strongly coupled dusty
(complex) plasmas. It is shown that, within the present approach, the sound
velocity is completely determined by particle-particle correlations and the
neutralizing medium (plasma), apart from providing screening of the Coulomb
interaction, has no other effect on the sound propagation. The ratio of the
actual sound velocity to its ""ideal gas"" (weak coupling) scale only weakly

decrease with the increase of the screening strength. The limitations of the
present approach in applications to real complex plasmas are briefly discussed.

change the results of smooth test problems, we also find that cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation are unaffected, demonstrating that the
numerical errors eliminated by the new formulation do not impact these

particular question is whether gravity causes decoherence - an unavoidable
source of noise. Several models for gravitational decoherence have been
proposed, not all of which can be described quantum mechanically. In parallel,
several experiments have been proposed to test some of these models, where the
data obtained by such experiments is analyzed assuming quantum mechanics. Since
we may need to modify quantum mechanics to account for gravity, however, one
may question the validity of using quantum mechanics as a calculational tool to
draw conclusions from experiments concerning gravity.
  Here we propose an experiment to estimate gravitational decoherence whose
conclusions hold even if quantum mechanics would need to be modified. We first
establish a general information-theoretic notion of decoherence which reduces
to the standard measure within quantum mechanics. Second, drawing on ideas from
quantum information, we propose a very general experiment that allows us to
obtain a quantitative estimate of decoherence of any physical process for any
physical theory satisfying only very mild conditions.Finally, we propose a
concrete experiment using optomechanics to estimate gravitational decoherence
in any such theory, including quantum mechanics as a special case.
  Our work raises the interesting question whether other properties of nature
could similarly be established from experimental observations alone - that is,

double-wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNT) bundles. Above 15 K the resistance shows
an ohmic behavior and its temperature dependence is well described using the
variable-range hopping for one-dimensional system. The magnetoresistance is
negative and can be explained using an empirical model based on spin-scattering
processes indicating the existence of magnetic order up to room temperature. At
temperatures between 2 K and 15 K the resistance is non-ohmic and the
current-voltage characteristics reveal the appearance of a potential, which can
be well described by a fluctuation-induced tunneling conduction model. In this
low temperature range and at low enough input current, a positive
magnetoresistance appears - in addition to the negative one - with an
extraordinary hysteresis in field and vanishes at $T \sim 15 $K, suggesting the
existence of a superconducting state. Magnetization results partially support
the existence of both phenomena in the DWCNT bundles.

of ionization on pressure (caused by the underestimation of the energy gap
between conduction bands and valence bands) in the first-principles method are
illustrated by the calculation. Pressure ionization and thermal smearing are
shown as the major factors to prevent the deviation of pressure from global
accumulation along the Hugoniot. In addition, cancellation between electronic
kinetic pressure and virial pressure further reduces the deviation. The
calculation of X-ray absorption spectra shows that the band gap of KCl persists
after the pressure ionization of the $3p$ electrons of Cl and K taking place at
lower energy, which provides a detailed understanding to the evolution of

constituents evolving in time as a trajectory under the action of the
wave-function, is the main objective of the Bohm theory. However, its standard
formulation is referred to the statistical ensemble of its possible
trajectories. The statistical ensemble is introduced in order to establish the
exact correspondence (the Born's rule) between the probability density on the
spatial configurations and the quantum distribution, that is the squared
modulus of the wave-function. In this work we explore the possibility of using
the pilot wave theory at the level of a single Bohm's trajectory. The pilot
wave theory allows a formally self-consistent representation of quantum systems
as a single Bohm's trajectory, but in this case there is no room for the Born's
rule at least in its standard form. We will show that a correspondence exists
between the statistical distribution of configurations along the single Bohm's
trajectory and the quantum distribution for a subsystem interacting with the
environment in a multicomponent system. To this aim, we present the numerical
results of the single Bohm's trajectory description of the model system of six
confined rotors with random interactions. We find a rather close correspondence
between the coordinate distribution of one rotor along its trajectory and the
time averaged marginal quantum distribution for the same rotor. This might be
considered as the counterpart of the standard Born's rule. Furthermore a
strongly fluctuating behavior with a fast loss of correlation is found for the
evolution of each rotor coordinate. This suggests that a Markov process might
well approximate the evolution of the Bohm's coordinate of a single rotor and
it is shown that the correspondence between coordinate distribution and quantum
distribution of the rotor is exactly verified.

there is no standard approach to evaluate and measure enjoyment in
