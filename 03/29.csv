the zoo of Be and shell stars. The shell dominates the spectrum, showing lines
typical for spectral types mid-A to early-F, while the presence of a late/mid
B-type central star is indicated by photospheric hydrogen line wings and helium
lines. Numerous metallic absorption lines have broad wings but taper to narrow
cores. They cannot be fit by Voigt profiles.
  We aim to describe and illustrate unusual spectral features of this star, and
make rough calculations to estimate physical conditions and abundances in the
shell. Furthermore, the central star is characterized.
  We assume mean conditions for the shell. An electron density estimate is made
from the Inglis-Teller formula. Excitation temperatures and column densities
for Fe I and Fe II are derived from curves of growth. The neutral H column
density is estimated from high Paschen members. The column densities are
compared with calculations made with the photoionization code Cloudy.
Atmospheric parameters of the central star are constrained employing non-LTE
spectrum synthesis.
  Overall chemical abundances are close to solar. Column densities of the
dominant ions of several elements, as well as excitation temperatures and the
mean electron density are well accounted for by a simple model. Several
features, including the degree of ionization, are less well described.
  HD 94509 is a Be star with a stable shell, close to the terminal-age main
sequence. The dynamical state of the shell and the unusually shaped, but
symmetric line profiles, require a separate study.

formation of eutectic dendrites in a model ternary system within the framework
of the phase-field theory. We have mapped out the domain in which two-phase
dendritic structures grow. With increasing pulling velocity, the following
sequence of growth morphologies is observed: flat front lamellae $\rightarrow$
eutectic colonies $\rightarrow$ eutectic dendrites $\rightarrow$ dendrites with
target pattern $\rightarrow$ partitionless dendrites $\rightarrow$
partitionless flat front. We confirm that the two-phase and one-phase dendrites
have similar forms, and display a similar scaling of the dendrite tip radius
with the interface free energy. It is also found that the possible eutectic
patterns include the target pattern, and single- and multiarm spirals, of which
the thermal fluctuations choose. The most probable number of spiral arms
increases with increasing tip radius and with decreasing kinetic anisotropy.
Our numerical simulations confirm that in agreement with the assumptions of a
recent analysis of two-phase dendrites [S. Akamatsu, S. Bottin-Rousseau, G.
Faivre, and E. A. Brener, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 112}, 105502 (2014)], the
Jackson-Hunt scaling of the eutectic wavelength with pulling velocity is obeyed
in the parameter domain explored, and that the natural eutectic wavelength is
proportional to the tip radius of the two-phase dendrites. Finally, we find
that it is very difficult/virtually impossible to form spiraling two-phase
dendrites without anisotropy, an observation that seems to contradict the
expectations of Akamatsu {\it et al.}. Yet, it cannot be excluded, that in
isotropic systems two-phase dendrites are rare events difficult to observe in
simulations.

chiral, linear and vector superfields of a Lagrangian can be ""unfolded"" into
second-order operators. The ""unfolded"" formulation has only polynomial
interactions and additional massive superfields, some of which are ghost-like

the massive fields of the ""unfolded"" formulation generates an effective theory

possible after disease inception. In this manuscript, we show that
patient-to-patient variability sets a fundamental limit on outcome prediction
accuracy for a general class of mathematical models for the immune response to
infection. However, accuracy can be increased at the expense of delayed
prognosis. We investigate several systems of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) that model the host immune response to a pathogen load. Advantages of
systems of ODEs for investigating the immune response to infection include the
ability to collect data on large numbers of `virtual patients', each with a
given set of model parameters, and obtain many time points during the course of
the infection. We implement patient-to-patient variability $v$ in the ODE
models by randomly selecting the model parameters from Gaussian distributions
with variance $v$ that are centered on physiological values. We use logistic
regression with one-versus-all classification to predict the discrete
steady-state outcomes of the system. We find that the prediction algorithm
achieves near $100\%$ accuracy for $v=0$, and the accuracy decreases with
increasing $v$ for all ODE models studied. The fact that multiple steady-state
outcomes can be obtained for a given initial condition, i.e. the basins of
attraction overlap in the space of initial conditions, limits the prediction
accuracy for $v>0$. Increasing the elapsed time of the variables used to train
and test the classifier, increases the prediction accuracy, while adding
explicit external noise to the ODE models decreases the prediction accuracy.
Our results quantify the competition between early prognosis and high
prediction accuracy that is frequently encountered by clinicians.

approximately equally to the specific heat. The Debye temperature for graphene

and intracluster regions are commonly determined from spectral radio and
(rarely) $\gamma$-ray measurements. The time-independent particle spectral
density distributions are commonly assumed to have a power-law (PL) form over
the relevant energy range. A theoretical relation between energy densities of
electrons and protons is usually adopted, and energy equipartition is invoked
to determine the mean magnetic field strength in the emitting region. We show
that for typical conditions, in both star-forming and starburst galaxies, these
estimates need to be scaled down substantially due to significant energy losses
that (effectively) flatten the electron spectral density distribution,
resulting in a much lower energy density than deduced when the distribution is
assumed to have a PL form. The steady-state electron distribution in the
nuclear regions of starburst galaxies is calculated by accounting for Coulomb,
bremsstrahlung, Compton, and synchrotron losses; the corresponding emission
spectra of the latter two processes are calculated and compared to the
respective PL spectra. We also determine the proton steady-state distribution
by taking into account Coulomb and pion production losses, and briefly discuss
implications of our steady-state particle spectra for estimates of proton
energy densities and magnetic fields.

(QP). Active-set methods are defined for a particular primal and dual
formulation of a QP with general equality constraints and simple lower bounds
on the variables. In the first part of the paper, two methods are proposed, one
primal and one dual. These methods generate a sequence of iterates that are
feasible with respect to the equality constraints associated with the
optimality conditions of the primal-dual form. The primal method maintains
feasibility of the primal inequalities while driving the infeasibilities of the
dual inequalities to zero. The dual method maintains feasibility of the dual
inequalities while moving to satisfy the primal inequalities. In each of these
methods, the search directions satisfy a KKT system of equations formed from
Hessian and constraint components associated with an appropriate column basis.
The composition of the basis is specified by an active-set strategy that
guarantees the nonsingularity of each set of KKT equations. Each of the
proposed methods is a conventional active-set method in the sense that an
initial primal- or dual-feasible point is required. In the second part of the
paper, it is shown how the quadratic program may be solved as a coupled pair of
primal and dual quadratic programs created from the original by simultaneously
shifting the simple-bound constraints and adding a penalty term to the
objective function. Any conventional column basis may be made optimal for such
a primal-dual pair of shifted-penalized problems. The shifts are then updated
using the solution of either the primal or the dual shifted problem. An obvious
application of this approach is to solve a shifted dual QP to define an initial
feasible point for the primal (or vice versa). The computational performance of
each of the proposed methods is evaluated on a set of convex problems.

  Environmental Processes",,,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops methodology for local sensitivity analysis based on
directional derivatives associated with spatial processes. Formal gradient
analysis for spatial processes was elaborated in previous papers, focusing on
distribution theory for directional derivatives associated with a response
variable assumed to follow a Gaussian process model. In the current work, these
ideas are extended to additionally accommodate a continuous covariate whose
directional derivatives are also of interest and to relate the behavior of the
directional derivatives of the response surface to those of the covariate
surface. It is of interest to assess whether, in some sense, the gradients of
the response follow those of the explanatory variable. The joint Gaussian
structure of all variables, including the directional derivatives, allows for
explicit distribution theory and, hence, kriging across the spatial region
using multivariate normal theory. Working within a Bayesian hierarchical
modeling framework, posterior samples enable all gradient analysis to occur
post model fitting. As a proof of concept, we show how our methodology can be
applied to a standard geostatistical modeling setting using a simulation
example. For a real data illustration, we work with point pattern data,
deferring our gradient analysis to the intensity surface, adopting a
log-Gaussian Cox process model. In particular, we relate elevation data to
point patterns associated with several tree species in Duke Forest.

analysis that the average BH mass decreases with increasing FeII strength when
quasar luminosity is fixed, consistent with this suggestion. Here we perform an
independent test by measuring the stellar velocity dispersion sigma* (hence the
BH mass via the M-sigma* relation) from decomposed host spectra in low-redshift
Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. We found that at fixed quasar luminosity,
sigma* systematically decreases with increasing FeII strength, confirming that
Eddington ratio increases with FeII strength. We also found that at fixed

The only little monsoonal influence is seen when Indus River discharges

Himalayas in spring (February-April) as compared to less sediment discharge
observed during winter (November-December). The pre-monsoon SSC images show
overall high suspended sediments whereas post-monsoon SSC images show
comparatively low SSC. The use of enhanced resolution ocean color satellite

a learner sequentially chooses arms with unknown reward distributions in order

the reward distributions of each arm are independent. But in a wide variety of
decision problems -- from drug dosage to dynamic pricing -- the expected
rewards of different arms are correlated, so that selecting one arm provides
information about the expected rewards of other arms as well. We propose and
analyze a class of models of such decision problems, which we call {\em global

of a single unknown parameter, we construct a greedy policy that achieves {\em
bounded regret}, with a bound that depends on the single true parameter of the
problem. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times
with probability one. For this case we also obtain a bound on regret that is
{\em independent of the true parameter}; this bound is sub-linear, with an
exponent that depends on the informativeness of the arms. We also propose a
variant of the greedy policy that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$

association with causality and, particularly, the most stringent one-way
causality, if existing, is firmly substantiated and stated as a fact in proved
theorems. Established in this study are the information flows among the
components of time-discrete mappings and time-continuous dynamical systems of
arbitrary dimensionality, both deterministic and stochastic. They have been
obtained explicitly in closed form, and all possess the property of causality,
which reads: if a component, say $x_i$, has an evolutionary law independent of
$x_j$, then the information flow from $x_j$ to $x_i$ vanishes. These results
have been put to applications with benchmark systems, such as the Kaplan-Yorke
map, the R\""ossler system, the baker transformation, the H\'enon map, and a
stochastic potential flow. Besides recovering the properties as expected from
the respective systems, some of the applications show that the information flow
structure underlying a complex trajectory pattern could be tractable. For
linear systems, the resulting remarkably concise formula asserts analytically
that causation implies correlation, while correlation does not imply causation,
resolving unambiguously the long-standing debate over causation versus

resolve the location-based objectives with new heuristics for indoor

The CHI-based system offers the pathway suggestion and the solution of the

laborer can achieve his location-based objectives by walking through the area
of interest and simultaneously online interacting with the CHI-based system

inquires data from sources at runtime upon receiving a query. In this paper, we
address the Time-Cost Minimization Problem for online query scheduling, and

such connections as covariant derivatives are given by means of several
invariant tensors: the ones of the usual Sasakian structure of the sphere; an

$\mathbb{S}^7$; and the involved ones in the almost contact metric structure of

are the three key steps for a localization process. However, compared with the
other two steps, beacon node placement still lacks a comprehensive, systematic
study in research literatures. To fill this gap, we address the Beacon Node
Placment (BNP) problem that deploys beacon nodes for minimal localization error
in this paper. BNP is difficult in that the localization error is determined by
a complicated combination of factors, i.e., the localization error differing
greatly under a different environment, with a different algorithm applied, or
with a different type of beacon node used. In view of the hardness of BNP, we
propose an approximate function to reduce time cost in localization error
calculation, and also prove its time complexity and error bound. By
approximation, a sub-optimal distribution of beacon nodes could be found within
acceptable time cost for placement. In the experiment, we test our method and
compare it with other node placement methods under various settings and
environments. The experimental results show feasibility and effectiveness of
our method in practice.

demonstrate two new methods for extracting the differential phase between
dual-species atom interferometers for precise tests of the weak equivalence

knowledge of the system noise to estimate the differential phase based on a
statistical model. The second method utilizes a mechanical accelerometer to
reconstruct single-sensor interference fringes based on measurements of the
vibration-induced phase. An improved ellipse-fitting algorithm is also
implemented as a third method for comparison. These analysis tools are
investigated using both numerical simulations and experimental data from
simultaneous $^{87}$Rb and $^{39}$K interferometers, and both new techniques
are shown to produce bias-free estimates of the differential phase. We also
report observations of phase correlations between atom interferometers composed
of different chemical species. This correlation enables us to reject
common-mode vibration noise by a factor of 730, and to make preliminary tests
of the weak equivalence principle with a sensitivity of $1.6 \times 10^{-6}$

equivalent gamma-ray energy and redshift, we simulate radio light curves in a
framework generalized for any circumburst medium structure and including a
parametrization of the shell thickness regime that is more realistic than the
simple assumption of thick- or thin-shell approximations. Building on earlier
work by Mundell et al. (2007) and Melandri et al. (2010) in which the typical
frequency of the reverse shock was suggested to lie at radio, rather than
optical wavelengths at early times, we show that the brightest and most
distinct reverse-shock radio signatures are detectable up to 0.1 -- 1 day after
the burst, emphasizing the need for rapid radio follow-up. Detection is easier
for bursts with later optical peaks, high isotropic energies, lower circumburst
medium densities, and at observing frequencies that are less prone to
synchrotron self-absorption effects - typically above a few GHz. Given recent
detections of polarized prompt gamma-ray and optical reverse-shock emission, we
suggest that detection of polarized radio/mm emission will unambiguously
confirm the presence of low-frequency reverse shocks at early time.

communication systems, can severely limit the performance of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although we can resort to compensation schemes
to mitigate part of these impairments, a certain amount of residual impairments
always persists. In this paper, we consider a training-based point-to-point
MIMO system with residual transmit RF impairments (RTRI) using spatial
multiplexing transmission. Specifically, we derive a new linear channel
estimator for the proposed model, and show that RTRI create an estimation error
floor in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, we derive
closed-form expressions for the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR)
distributions, along with analytical expressions for the ergodic achievable
rates of zero-forcing, maximum ratio combining, and minimum mean-squared error
receivers, respectively. In addition, we optimize the ergodic achievable rates
with respect to the training sequence length, and demonstrate that finite
dimensional systems with RTRI generally require more training at high SNRs than
those with ideal hardware. At last, we extend our analysis to large-scale MIMO
configurations, and derive deterministic equivalents of the ergodic achievable
rates. It is shown that, by deploying large receive antenna arrays, the extra
training requirements due to RTRI can be eliminated. In fact, with sufficiently
large number of receive antennas, systems with RTRI may even need less training

choice of $\chi_b(mP)$ feed-down ratios and NRQCD factorization scale. The
results can explain the measurements on yield very well as in our previous
work. The polarization puzzle to $\Upsilon(3S)$ is now solved by considering
the $\chi_b(3P)$ feed-down contributions. The ratio of

little difference, but there are sizeable difference for the fitted

in the range $M_\pi \sim 259-460$ MeV at a lattice spacing $a\sim 0.075$ fm.
Finite volume effects are studied comparing lattices with two different linear

approached from the SU(3) limit keeping the flavour averaged light quark mass
fixed. The baryon masses are extrapolated using expansions in the strange-light

complex internal structure. Overall agreement is found with experiment for the
masses and splittings of the singly charmed baryons. As part of the calculation
an analysis of the lower lying charmonium, $D$ and $D_s$ spectra was performed
in order to assess discretisation errors. The gross spectra are reproduced,

quantitatively study the effects of latent heat and surface tension on phase

the three velocity components of convective flows in the solar interior from
sets of wave travel-time measurements. For small amplitude flows, the forward
problem is described in good approximation by a large system of convolution
equations. The input observations are highly noisy random vectors with a known
dense covariance matrix. This leads to a large statistical linear inverse
problem.
  Whereas for deterministic linear inverse problems several computationally
efficient minimax optimal regularization methods exist, only one
minimax-optimal linear estimator exists for statistical linear inverse
problems: the Pinsker estimator. However, it is often computationally
inefficient because it requires a singular value decomposition of the forward
operator or it is not applicable because of an unknown noise covariance matrix,
so it is rarely used for real-world problems. These limitations do not apply in
helioseismology. We present a simplified proof of the optimality properties of
the Pinsker estimator and show that it yields significantly better
reconstructions than traditional inversion methods used in helioseismology,
i.e.\ Regularized Least Squares (Tikhonov regularization) and SOLA (approximate
inverse) methods.
  Moreover, we discuss the incorporation of the mass conservation constraint in
