  can one say what should happen?","19 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a piecewise smooth system in the neighborhood of a co-dimension 2
discontinuity manifold $\Sigma$. Within the class of Filippov solutions, if
$\Sigma$ is attractive, one should expect solution trajectories to slide on
$\Sigma$. It is well known, however, that the classical Filippov
convexification methodology is ambiguous on $\Sigma$. The situation is further
complicated by the possibility that, regardless of how sliding on $\Sigma$ is
taking place, during sliding motion a trajectory encounters so-called generic
first order exit points, where $\Sigma$ ceases to be attractive.
  In this work, we attempt to understand what behavior one should expect of a
solution trajectory near $\Sigma$ when $\Sigma$ is attractive, what to expect
when $\Sigma$ ceases to be attractive (at least, at generic exit points), and
finally we also contrast and compare the behavior of some regularizations
proposed in the literature.
  Through analysis and experiments we will confirm some known facts, and
provide some important insight: (i) when $\Sigma$ is attractive, a solution
trajectory indeed does remain near $\Sigma$, viz. sliding on $\Sigma$ is an
appropriate idealization (of course, in general, one cannot predict which
sliding vector field should be selected); (ii) when $\Sigma$ loses attractivity
(at first order exit conditions), a typical solution trajectory leaves a
neighborhood of $\Sigma$; (iii) there is no obvious way to regularize the
system so that the regularized trajectory will remain near $\Sigma$ as long as
$\Sigma$ is attractive, and so that it will be leaving (a neighborhood of)
$\Sigma$ when $\Sigma$ looses attractivity.
  We reach the above conclusions by considering exclusively the given piecewise
smooth system, without superimposing any assumption on what kind of dynamics
near $\Sigma$ (or sliding motion on $\Sigma$) should have been taking place.

essential to improving our knowledge of the nature of dark energy. On the
theory and modeling front, large-scale simulations of cosmic structure
formation play an important role in interpreting the observations and in the
challenging task of extracting cosmological physics at the needed precision.
These simulations must cover a parameter range beyond the standard six
cosmological parameters and need to be run at high mass and force resolution.
One key simulation-based task is the generation of accurate theoretical
predictions for observables, via the method of emulation. Using a new sampling
technique, we explore an 8-dimensional parameter space including massive
neutrinos and a variable dark energy equation of state. We construct trial
emulators using two surrogate models (the linear power spectrum and an
approximate halo mass function). The new sampling method allows us to build
precision emulators from just 26 cosmological models and to increase the
emulator accuracy by adding new sets of simulations in a prescribed way. This
allows emulator fidelity to be systematically improved as new observational
data becomes available and higher accuracy is required. Finally, using one LCDM
cosmology as an example, we study the demands imposed on a simulation campaign
to achieve the required statistics and accuracy when building emulators for
dark energy investigations.

influence of the dark sector on the gravitational collapse of an electrically
charged scalar field. A phantom scalar field was used as a model of dark energy
in the system. Dark matter was modeled by a complex scalar field with a quartic
potential, charged under a U(1)-gauge field. The dark components were coupled
to the electrically charged scalar field via the exponential coupling and the
gauge field-Maxwell field kinetic mixing, respectively. Complete non-linear
simulations of the investigated process were performed. They were conducted
from regular initial data to the end state, which was the matter dispersal or a
singularity formation in a spacetime. During the collapse in the presence of
dark energy dynamical wormholes and naked singularities were formed in emerging
spacetimes. The wormhole throats were stabilized by the violation of the null
energy condition, which occurred due to a significant increase of a value of
the phantom scalar field function in its vicinity. The square of mass parameter
of the dark matter scalar field potential controlled the formation of a Cauchy
horizon or wormhole throats in the spacetime. The joint impact of dark energy
and dark matter on the examined process indicated that the former decides what
type of an object forms, while the latter controls the amount of time needed
for the object to form. Additionally, the dark sector suppresses the natural
tendency of an electrically charged scalar field to form a dynamical
Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime during the gravitational collapse.

from our NUGA (-south) sample and is a ringed, spiral galaxy with a stellar
bar. We present emission and absorption line measurements in the central kpc of
NGC 1566. Broad and narrow Br{\gamma} lines were detected. The detection of a
broad Br{\gamma} component is a clear sign of a super-massive black hole in the
center. Blackbody emission temperatures of ~1000 K are indicative of a hot dust
component, the torus, in the nuclear region. The molecular hydrogen lines,
hydrogen recombination lines, and [FeII] indicate that the excitation at the
center is coming from an AGN. The central region is predominantly inhabited by
molecular gas, dust, and an old K-M type giant stellar population. The
molecular gas and stellar velocity maps both show a rotation pattern. The
molecular gas velocity field shows a perturbation toward the center that is
typical for bars or spiral density waves. The molecular gas species of warm
H_2(1-0)S(1) and cold ^{12}CO(3-2) gas trace a nuclear gas disk of about 3"" in
radius with a nuclear spiral reaching toward the nucleus. From the equivalent
width of H_2(1-0)S(1) a molecular ring with r<~3"" can be inferred. This spiral
seems to be an instrument that allows gas to fall toward the nucleus down to
<50 pc scales. The excitation of molecular hydrogen in the nuclear gas disk is
not clear but diagnostic diagrams show a distinction between the nuclear region
and a <9 Myr old star forming region at the southwestern spiral arm. Possibly
shocked gas is detected ~2"" from the center, which is visible in dispersion
maps of H$_2$(1-0)S(1) and ^{12}CO(3-2) and in the 0.87 mm continuum.

the adaptive case, in which the depth of the FMM tree is non-uniform. Previous
works in this area have focused mostly on special types of adaptive
distributions, for example when points accumulate on a 2D manifold or
accumulate around a few points in space. Instead, we considered a more general
situation in which fractal sets, e.g., Cantor sets and generalizations, are
used to create adaptive sets of points. Such sets are characterized by their
dimension, a number between 0 and 3. We introduced a mathematical framework to
define a converging sequence of octrees, and based on that, demonstrated how to
increase $N \to \infty$.
  A new complexity analysis for the adaptive FMM is introduced. It is shown
that the ${\cal{O}}(N)$ complexity is achievable for any distribution of
particles, when a modified adaptive FMM is exploited. We analyzed how the FMM
performs for fractal point distributions, and how optimal parameters can be
picked, e.g., the criterion used to stop the subdivision of an FMM cell. A new
subdividing double-threshold method is introduced, and better performance
demonstrated. Parameters in the FMM are modeled as a function of particle
distribution dimension, and the optimal values are obtained. A three
dimensional kernel independent black box adaptive FMM is implemented and used
for all calculations.

receiver in terms of coverage probability under two realistic content
availability setups: (i) content of interest for a typical device is available
at a device chosen uniformly at random from the same cluster, which we term
uniform content availability, and (ii) content of interest is available at the
$k^{th}$ closest device from the typical device inside the same cluster, which
we term $k$-closest content availability. Using these coverage probability
results, we also characterize the area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the whole

derivation of the distributions of distances from a typical device to both the
intra- and inter-cluster devices. Our analysis reveals that an optimum number
of D2D transmitters must be simultaneously activated per cluster in order to
maximize ASE. This can be interpreted as the classical tradeoff between more
aggressive frequency reuse and higher interference power. The optimum number of
simultaneously transmitting devices and the resulting ASE increase as the
content is made available closer to the receivers. Our analysis also quantifies
the best and worst case performance of clustered D2D networks both in terms of

In local-tier, the global-tier results are adaptively updated using real-time

Microgrid with 35kW of solar generation capacity. Experimental results show
that the proposed two-tier prediction method achieves higher accuracy compared
to day-ahead predictions while providing the same prediction length. The

propagation; if the scattering medium is moving, this will inevitably also
cause changes in the momentum of the particles, so-called diffusive
reacceleration. This can be described as diffusion in momentum space. Diffusive
reacceleration has often been invoked to explain the peak observed in
secondary-to-primary ratios at a few GeV, in particular Boron-to-Carbon. This
avoids the necessity to postulate an ad-hoc break in the spatial diffusive
coefficient, and has become almost a standard in modelling cosmic-ray spectra.
However, at the levels invoked, the process implies a significant input of
energy from the interstellar medium into cosmic rays, so that in such models
interstellar space competes with the usual accelerators like supernova
remnants. The questions arise: is reacceleration really occurring at the high
level required to explain secondary-to-primary ratios? and are the energy
requirements physically plausible? We address this issue using both analytical
and numerical models of cosmic-ray propagation.

experiments have been carried out on a well-characterized sample of ""stuffed""
(Pr-rich) Pr$_{2+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$O$_{7-\delta}$. Elastic neutron scattering shows
the onset of long-range spin-ice ""2-in/2-out"" magnetic order at $T_M = 0.93$ K,
with an ordered moment of 1.7(1)$\mu_\mathrm{B}$/Pr ion at low temperatures.
Approximate lower bounds on the correlation length and correlation time in the
ordered state are 170 \AA\ and 0.7 ns, respectively. $\mu$SR experiments yield
an upper bound 2.6(7) mT on the local field $B_\mathrm{loc}^{4f}$ at the muon
site, which is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the expected dipolar
field for long-range spin-ice ordering of 1.7$\mu_B$ moments (120--270 mT,
depending on muon site). This shortfall is due in part to splitting of the
non-Kramers crystal-field ground-state doublets of near-neighbor Pr$^{3+}$ ions
by the $\mu^+$-induced lattice distortion. For this to be the only effect,
however, $\sim$160 Pr moments out to a distance of $\sim$14 \AA\ must be
suppressed. An alternative scenario, which is consistent with the observed
reduced nuclear hyperfine Schottky anomaly in the specific heat, invokes slow
correlated Pr-moment fluctuations in the ordered state that average
$B_\mathrm{loc}^{4f}$ on the $\mu$SR time scale (${\sim}10^{-7}$ s), but are
static on the time scale of the elastic neutron scattering experiments
(${\sim}10^{-9}$ s). In this picture the dynamic muon relaxation suggests a
Pr$^{3+}$ $4f$ correlation time of a few nanoseconds, which should be
observable in a neutron spin echo experiment.

each agent, to ensure that they can cooperate successfully. A necessary
requirement is that the given goals be cooperatively satisfiable. We prove that
there exist games for which the GR(1) fragment with liveness properties over

cooperatively winning set. The obstruction is due to circular dependencies of
liveness goals. To prevent circularity, we introduce nested games as a

is symbolic, with fixpoint structure similar to the GR(1) synthesis algorithm,
implying time complexity polynomial in the number of states, and linear in the

helical turbulence can generate significant large-scale fields even in the
presence of strong small-scale dynamo action. During the kinematic stage, the
unified large/small-scale dynamo grows fields with a shape-invariant
eigenfunction, with most power peaked at small scales or large $k$, as in
\citet{SB14}. Nevertheless, the large-scale field can be clearly detected as an
excess power at small $k$ in the negatively polarized component of the energy
spectrum for a forcing with positively polarized waves. Its strength $bar{B}$,
relative to the total rms field $B_{rms}$, decreases with increasing magnetic
Reynolds number, $R_m$. However, as the Lorentz force becomes important, the
field generated by the unified dynamo orders itself by saturating on
successively larger scales. The magnetic integral scale for the positively
polarized waves, characterizing the small-scale field, increases significantly
from the kinematic stage to saturation. This implies that the small-scale field
becomes as coherent as possible for a given forcing scale, which averts the
$R_m$-dependent quenching of $\bar{B}/B_rms$. These results are obtained for
$1024^3$ DNS with magnetic Prandtl numbers of $P_m=0.1$ and $10$. For
$P_m=0.1$, $\bar{B}/B_{rms}$ grows from about $0.04$ to about $0.4$ at
saturation, aided in the final stages by helicity dissipation. For $P_m=10$,
$\bar{B}/B_{rms}$ grows from much less than 0.01 to values of the order the
$0.2$. Our results confirm that there is a unified large/small-scale dynamo in
helical turbulence.

MHD core formation simulations. We confirm the anisotropic core formation model
we previously proposed, and quantify the dependence of median core properties
on the pre-shock inflow velocity and upstream magnetic field strength. Our
results suggest that bound core properties are set by the total dynamic
pressure (dominated by large-scale turbulence) and thermal sound speed c_s in
GMCs, independent of magnetic field strength. For models with Mach number
between 5 and 20, the median core masses and radii are comparable to the
critical Bonnor-Ebert mass and radius defined using the dynamic pressure for
P_ext. Our results correspond to M_core = 1.2 c_s^4/sqrt(G^3 rho_0 v_0^2) and
R_core = 0.34 c_s^2/sqrt(G rho_0 v_0^2) for rho_0 and v_0 the large-scale mean

find cores and filaments form simultaneously, and filament column densities are
a factor ~2 greater than the surrounding cloud when cores first collapse. We
also show that cores identified in our simulations have physical properties

short spin-down times, while models for SLSNe-I invoke neutron stars with
weaker fields and longer spin-down times of weeks. Here we identify a
transition region in the space of Bd and birth period for which a magnetar can
power both a long GRB and a luminous SN. In particular, we show that a 2 ms

previous estimates of the maximum rotational energy of a proto-magnetar were
too conservative and energies up to Emax ~1-2e53 erg are possible. The magnetar

the observed wavelength range toward bluer wavelengths, we optimize such

allow for studies of heavy elements (Z>38) whose formation processes remain
poorly constrained. In this context, spectrographs optimized for observing blue

wavelengths are too weak to be detected in metal-poor stars. This means that
some elements cannot be studied in the visual-redder regions, and important
scientific tracers and science cases are lost. The present era of large public
surveys will target millions of stars. Here we describe the requirements
driving the design of the forthcoming survey instrument 4MOST, a multi-object

high-density, wide-area survey of stars and the science that can be achieved

statistics used to address TBTF suffer from the look-elsewhere effect and/or
disregard certain aspects of the data on the MW satellite population. We devise
a new statistic that is not hampered by these shortcomings, and, using only
data on the 9 known MW satellite galaxies with $V_{\rm max}>15{\rm kms}^{-1}$,
demonstrate that $1.4^{+3.3}_{-1.1}\%$ of MW-size host haloes have a subhalo
population in statistical agreement with that of the MW. However, when using
data on the MW satellite galaxies down to $V_{\rm max}=8{\rm kms}^{-1}$, this
MW consistent fraction plummets to $<5\times10^{-4}$ (at 68% CL). Hence, if it
turns out that the inventory of MW satellite galaxies is complete down to
8km/s, then the maximum circular velocities of MW satellites are utterly
inconsistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, unless baryonic effects can
drastically increase the spread in $V_{\rm max}$ values of satellite galaxies

Beyond experimental implementations, this provides an arena in which to address
certain foundational aspects such as the role of coherence in thermodynamics,
the use of clock degrees of freedom and the simulation of local time-dependent
Hamiltonians in a particular quantum subsystem. For small-scale systems
additional issues arise. Firstly, it is not clear to what degree genuine
ordered thermodynamic work has been extracted, and secondly non-trivial
back-actions on the thermal machine must be accounted for. We find that both
these aspects can be resolved through a judicious choice of quantum
measurements that magnify thermodynamic properties up the ladder of
length-scales, while simultaneously stabilizing the quantum thermal machine.
Within this framework we show that thermodynamic reversibility is obtained in a
particular Zeno limit, and finally illustrate these concepts with a concrete

accretion onto compact objects, such as core collapse of massive stars in
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and accretion onto supermassive black holes in active
galactic nuclei (AGN). It is generally accepted that these jets are powered
electromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.
However, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for
many orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven
non-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out
time-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,
Poynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the
rotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the
natural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that
controls jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of
instability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales
and causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause
jet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet
propagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the
external kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.
In flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may
stall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet
propagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time
scales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about
half of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and
energetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the
main dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission.

sample of Ultra Compact High Velocity Clouds (UCHVCs) discovered by the ALFALFA
neutral hydrogen (HI) survey. UCHVCs are sources with velocities and sizes
consistent with their being low-mass dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, but
without optical counterparts in existing catalogs. We are using the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope and pODI camera to image these objects and search for an associated
stellar population. In this paper, we present our observational strategy and
method for searching for resolved stellar counterparts to the UCHVCs. We
combine careful photometric measurements, a color-magnitude filter, and spatial
smoothing techniques to search for stellar overdensities in the g- and i-band
images. We also run statistical tests to quantify the likelihood that whatever
overdensities we find are real and not chance superpositions of sources. We
demonstrate the method by applying it to two data sets: WIYN imaging of Leo P,
a UCHVC discovered by ALFALFA and subsequently shown to be a low-mass
star-forming dwarf galaxy in the Local Volume, and WIYN imaging of AGC198606,
an HI cloud identified by ALFALFA that is near in position and velocity to the
Local Group dwarf Leo T. Applying the search method to the Leo P data yields an
unambiguous detection (>99% confidence) of the galaxy's stellar population.
Applying our method to the AGC198606 imaging yields a possible detection (92%
confidence) of an optical counterpart located ~2.5 arc minutes away from the
centroid of AGC198606's HI distribution and within the HI disk. We use the
optical data to estimate a distance to the stellar counterpart between 373 and
393 kpc, with an absolute magnitude M_i = -4.67+/-0.09. Combining the WIYN data
with our previous estimate of the HI mass of AGC198606 from WSRT imaging yields
an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~45-110.

Given an increasing sequence of dimensions, a flag in a vector space is an
increasing sequence of subspaces with those dimensions. The set of all such
flags (the flag manifold) can be projectively coordinatized using products of
minors of a matrix. These products are indexed by tableaux on a Young diagram.
A basis of ""standard monomials"" for the vector space generated by such
projective coordinates over the entire flag manifold has long been known. A
Schubert variety is a subset of flags specified by a permutation. Lakshmibai,
Musili, and Seshadri gave a standard monomial basis for the smaller vector
space generated by the projective coordinates restricted to a Schubert variety.
Reiner and Shimozono made this theory more explicit by giving a straightening
algorithm for the products of the minors in terms of the right key of a Young
tableau. Since then, Willis introduced scanning tableaux as a more direct way
to obtain right keys. This paper uses scanning tableaux to give more-direct
proofs of the spanning and the linear independence of the standard monomials.
In the appendix it is noted that this basis is a weight basis for the dual of a
Demazure module for a Borel subgroup of GL(n). This paper contains a complete
proof that the characters of these modules (the key polynomials) can be
expressed as the sums of the weights for the tableaux used to index the
standard monomial bases.

constructed by endowing empirical margins with a copula. This setting includes
Latin Hypercube Sampling with dependence, also known as the Iman--Conover
method. The primary question addressed here is the convergence of the component
sum, which is relevant to risk aggregation in insurance and finance.
  This paper shows that a CLT for the aggregated risk distribution is not
available, so that the underlying mathematical problem goes beyond classic
functional CLTs for empirical copulas. This issue is relevant to Monte-Carlo
based risk aggregation in all multivariate models generated by plugging
empirical margins into a copula.
  Instead of a functional CLT, this paper establishes strong uniform
consistency of the estimated sum distribution function and provides a
sufficient criterion for the convergence rate $O(n^{-1/2})$ in probability.
These convergence results hold for all copulas with bounded densities. Examples
with unbounded densities include bivariate Clayton and Gauss copulas. The
convergence results are not specific to the component sum and hold also for any
other componentwise non-decreasing aggregation function. On the other hand,
convergence of estimates for the joint distribution is much easier to prove,
including CLTs.
  Beyond Iman--Conover estimates, the results of this paper apply to
multivariate distributions obtained by plugging empirical margins into an exact
copula or by plugging exact margins into an empirical copula.

We found that NGC7793 has a well-defined gas-phase radial oxygen gradient of

0.011 dex kpc$^{-1}$) for 0.04$<$R$_{\rm G}$/R$_{\rm 25}$ $<$ 0.51, where the
larger relative uncertainty derives mostly from the larger inclination of this

similar, in mass and morphology, to M33 and the Milky Way, respectively. Since
at zeroth order we expect the radial metallicity gradients to depend on mass
and galaxy type, we compared our galaxies in the framework of radial
metallicity models best suited for M33 and the Galaxy. We found a good
agreement between M33 and NGC7793, pointing toward similar evolution for the
two galaxies. We notice instead differences between NGC4945 and the radial
metallicity gradient model that best fits the Milky Way. We found that these
differences are likely related to the presence of an AGN combined with a bar in
the central regions of NGC4945, and to its interacting environment.

challenge. A major source of difficulty is the absence of precise information
on the distribution of high-dimensional estimators. Here, we consider linear
regression in the high-dimensional regime $p\gg n$. In this context, we would
like to perform inference on a high-dimensional parameters vector
$\theta^*\in{\mathbb R}^p$. Important progress has been achieved in computing
confidence intervals for single coordinates $\theta^*_i$. A key role in these
new methods is played by a certain debiased estimator $\hat{\theta}^{\rm d}$
that is constructed from the Lasso. Earlier work establishes that, under
suitable assumptions on the design matrix, the coordinates of
$\hat{\theta}^{\rm d}$ are asymptotically Gaussian provided $\theta^*$ is
$s_0$-sparse with $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/\log p )$. The condition $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/
\log p )$ is stronger than the one for consistent estimation, namely $s_0 =
o(n/ \log p)$. We study Gaussian designs with known or unknown population
covariance. When the covariance is known, we prove that the debiased estimator
is asymptotically Gaussian under the nearly optimal condition $s_0 = o(n/ (\log
p)^2)$. Note that earlier work was limited to $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/\log p)$ even
for perfectly known covariance. The same conclusion holds if the population
covariance is unknown but can be estimated sufficiently well, e.g. under the
same sparsity conditions on the inverse covariance as assumed by earlier work.
For intermediate regimes, we describe the trade-off between sparsity in the
coefficients and in the inverse covariance of the design. We further discuss
several applications of our results to high-dimensional inference. In
particular, we propose a new estimator that is minimax optimal up to a factor
$1+o_n(1)$ for i.i.d. Gaussian designs.

As highlighted by the recent survey of [Prins, Lacomme and Prodhon, Transport
Res. C (40), 179-200], no less than 70 recent articles use this technique. In
the vehicle routing literature, Split is usually assimilated to the search for

using Bellman's algorithm, where $n$ is the number of delivery points and $B$
is the average number of feasible routes that start with a given customer in

a consequence of a Monge property of $\mathcal{G}$. In this article, we
highlight a stronger property of this graph, leading to a simple alternative

geometric origin. Our study focuses on the evolution of the QPO as the source
moves through the color-color diagram, in which it traces out an
atoll-source-like track. The QPO frequency increases from ~0.4 Hz in the hard
state to ~25 Hz as the source approaches the soft state. Combining power
spectra based on QPO frequency reveals additional features that strongly
resemble those seen in non-dipping/eclipsing atoll sources. We show that the
low-frequency QPOs in atoll sources and the ~1 Hz QPO in EXO 0748-676 follow
similar relations with respect to the noise components in their power spectra.
We conclude that the frequencies of both types of QPOs are likely set by (the
same) precession of a misaligned inner accretion disk. For high-inclination
systems, like EXO 0748-676, this results in modulations of the neutron-star
emission due to obscuration or scattering, while for lower-inclination systems

resonant $g$-modes (the dynamical tide) are driven to such large amplitudes in
the stellar core that they excite a sea of other $g$-modes through weakly
nonlinear interactions. By solving the dynamics of large networks of
nonlinearly coupled modes, we show that the nonlinear dissipation rate of the
dynamical tide is several orders of magnitude larger than the linear
dissipation rate. We find stellar tidal quality factors $Q \approx 10^5-10^6$
for systems with planet mass $M_p \geq 0.5 M_\mathrm{J}$ and orbital period $P

shorter than a Gyr. Rapid, tidally induced orbital decay may explain the

calculated from TWE are in overall agreement with the full solution to the

calculated from TWE depends crucially on retaining the nonsphericity of the
background density and gravity. Only when the background nonsphericity of the
planet is taken into account, does the TWE make accurate enough prediction
(with a few tens of percent errors) for individual high-degree gravity moments
associated with deep zonal flows. Since the TWE is derived from the curl of the
Euler equation and is a local relation, it necessarily says nothing about any
density perturbations that contribute irrotational terms to the Euler equation
and that have a non-local origin. However, the predicted corrections from these
density contributions to the low harmonic degree gravity moments are not
discernible from insignificant changes in interior models while the corrections

observations and hence can construct an estimator having the same performance
as that of the centralized case. One natural question is whether Slepian-Wolf
rates are necessary to achieve the same estimation performance as that of the
centralized case. In this paper, we show that the answer to this question is
negative. We establish our result by explicitly constructing an asymptotically
minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) that has the same performance as
that of the optimal estimator in the centralized case while requiring
information rates less than the conditions required in the Slepian-Wolf rate
region.

guarantees that a non-equivalent implementation under test will always be
identified. Several approaches proposed sufficient, and sometimes also
necessary, conditions on the specification model and on the test suite in order
to guarantee completeness. Usually, these approaches impose several
restrictions on the specification and on the implementations, such as requiring
them to be reduced or complete. Further, test cases are required to be
non-blocking --- that is, they must run to completion --- on both the
specification and the implementation models. In this work we deal test cases
that can be blocking, we define a new notion that captures completeness, and we
characterize test suite completeness in this new scenario. We establish an
upper bound on the number of states of implementations beyond which no test
suite can be complete, both in the classical sense and in the new scenario with
blocking test cases.

explore the underlying physics of the traffic system, by examining closely the

therein. By using a mesoscopic approach, one entitles the catastrophe model the
same physical content as in the Landau's theory, and uncovers its close
connections to the instability of the equation of motion and to the transition
between different traffic states. In addition to the one-dimensional
configuration space, we generalize our discussions to the higher-dimensional
case, where the observed temporal oscillation in traffic flow data is
attributed to the curl of a vector field. We exhibit that our model can
reproduce the main features of the observed fundamental diagram including the
inverse-$\lambda$ shape and the wide scattering of congested traffic data. When
properly parameterized, the main feature of the data can be reproduced
reasonably well either in terms of the oscillating congested traffic or in

challenge for this view is to explain how mathematical theories can become
increasingly abstract and develop their own internal structure, whilst still
maintaining an appropriate empirical tether that can explain their later use in
physics. In order to address this, I offer a theory of mathematical
theory-building based on the idea that human knowledge has the structure of a
scale-free network and that abstract mathematical theories arise from a
repeated process of replacing strong analogies with new hubs in this network.
This allows mathematics to be seen as the study of regularities, within
regularities, within ..., within regularities of the natural world. Since
mathematical theories are derived from the natural world, albeit at a much
higher level of abstraction than most other scientific theories, it should come
as no surprise that they so often show up in physics.

fluctuations observed between successive {001} atomic planes, including a
counterintuitive reduction of the symmetry - a heritage of the lowered point
group symmetry at these planes. A model-independent analysis of the diffraction

0.03)(2\pi/a_{Si})$. Unlike prior measurements, averaged over a sizeable
density of electrons, this estimate is obtained directly from isolated
electrons. We further investigate the model-specific anisotropy of the wave
function envelope, related to the effective mass anisotropy. This anisotropy
appears in the KL variational wave function envelope as the ratio between Bohr
radii b=a. We demonstrate that the central cell corrected estimates for this

used to significantly shorten acquisition time or to improve Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR). In this paper the authors present a framework for fast MRI by
exploiting a reference image (FASTMER).
  Methods: The proposed approach utilizes the possible similarity of the
reference image that exists in many clinical MRI imaging scenarios. Such
scenarios include similarity between adjacent slices in high resolution MRI,
similarity between various contrasts in the same scan and similarity between
different scans of the same patient. The authors take into account that the
reference image may exhibit low similarity with the acquired image and develop
an iterative weighted approach for reconstruction, which tunes the weights
according to the degree of similarity.
  Results: Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the method in
three different clinical MRI scenarios: SNR improvement in high resolution
brain MRI, exploiting similarity between T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated
inversion recovery (FLAIR) for fast FLAIR scanning and utilizing similarity
between baseline and follow-up scans for fast follow-up. Results outperform
reconstruction results of existing state-of-the-art methods.
  Conclusions: The authors present a method for fast MRI by exploiting a
reference image. The method is based on an iterative reconstruction approach
that supports cases in which similarity to the reference scan is not
guaranteed, which enables the applicability of the method to a variety of MRI
applications. Thanks to the existence of reference images in various clinical
imaging scenarios, the proposed framework can play a major part in improving
reconstruction in many MR applications.

macroscopic level are fully deterministic. Here, it is shown that the relation
between quantum statistics and deterministic dynamics can be explained in terms
of ergodic averages over complex valued probabilities, where the fundamental
causality of motion is expressed by an action that appears as the phase of the
complex probability multiplied with the fundamental constant hbar. Importantly,
classical physics emerges as an approximation of this more fundamental theory
of motion, indicating that the assumption of a classical reality described by
differential geometry is merely an artefact of an extrapolation from the
observation of macroscopic dynamics to a fictitious level of precision that
does not exist within our actual experience of the world around us. It is
therefore possible to completely replace the classical concepts of trajectories

correction to ensure scalability. In this work we experimentally compare two
quantum annealing correction codes in the setting of antiferromagnetic chains,
using two different quantum annealing processors. The lower temperature
processor gives rise to higher success probabilities. The two codes differ in a
number of interesting and important ways, but both require four physical qubits
per encoded qubit. We find significant performance differences, which we
explain in terms of the effective energy boost provided by the respective
redundantly encoded logical operators of the two codes. The code with the
higher energy boost results in improved performance, at the expense of a lower
degree encoded graph. Therefore, we find that there exists an important
tradeoff between encoded connectivity and performance for quantum annealing
correction codes.

in response to various internal and external cues. Cell polarization is defined
through the spatio-temporal organization of molecules such as PI3K or small
GTPases, and is determined by intracellular signaling networks. It results in
directional forces through actin polymerization and myosin contractions. Many
existing mathematical models of cell polarization are formulated in terms of
reaction-diffusion systems of interacting molecules, and are often defined in
one or two spatial dimensions. In this paper, we introduce a 3D
reaction-diffusion model of interacting molecules in a single cell, and find
that cell geometry has an important role affecting the capability of a cell to
polarize, or change polarization when an external signal changes direction. Our
results suggest a geometrical argument why more roundish cells can repolarize
more effectively than cells which are elongated along the direction of the
original stimulus, and thus enable roundish cells to turn faster, as has been
observed in experiments. On the other hand, elongated cells preferentially
polarize along their main axis even when a gradient stimulus appears from
another direction. Furthermore, our 3D model can accurately capture the effect
of binding and unbinding of important regulators of cell polarization to and
from the cell membrane. This spatial separation of membrane and cytosol, not
possible to capture in 1D or 2D models, leads to marked differences of our
model from comparable lower-dimensional models.

are in systems with tightly packed inner planets. Inside-Out Planet Formation
(IOPF) has been proposed to explain these systems. It involves sequential in
situ planet formation at the local pressure maximum of a retreating dead zone
inner boundary (DZIB). Pebbles accumulate at this pressure trap, which builds
up a ring, and then a planet. The planet is expected to grow until it opens a
gap, which helps to both truncate pebble accretion and induce DZIB retreat that
sets the location of formation of the next planet. This simple scenario may be
modified if the planet migrates significantly from its formation location. Thus
planet-disk interactions play a crucial role in the IOPF scenario. We present
numerical simulations that first assess migration of planets of various masses
that are forming at the DZIB of an active accretion disk, where the effective
viscosity rapidly increases in the radially inward direction. We find that the
disk's torques on the planet tend to trap the planet at a location very close
to the initial pressure maximum where it formed. We then study gap opening by
these planets to assess at what mass a significant gap is created. Finally we
present a simple model for DZIB retreat due to penetration of X-rays from the
star to the disk midplane. Overall, these simulations help to quantify both the
mass scale of first,""Vulcan,"" planet formation and the orbital separation to
the location of second planet formation.

understanding how proteins form navigable small-world networks within

SCNs grow in size and transitivity strength as a protein folds, and SCNs from
successful MD trajectories are better formed in these terms. Findings from an
investigation on how to model the formation of SCNs using dynamic graph theory,
and suggestions to move forward are presented. A SCN is enriched with
short-range contacts and its formation correlates positively with secondary

protein folding from a graph theoretic view point, is more in tune with the

this increase in order coincides with improved navigability of PRNs.

optimal control problem involving the fractional powers of a symmetric and
uniformly elliptic second oder operator; control constraints are considered.
Since these fractional operators can be realized as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
map for a nonuniformly elliptic equation, we recast our problem as a
nonuniformly elliptic optimal control problem. The rapid decay of the solution
to this problem suggests a truncation that is suitable for numerical
approximation. We propose a fully discrete scheme that is based on piecewise
linear functions on quasi-uniform meshes to approximate the optimal control and
first-degree tensor product functions on anisotropic meshes for the optimal
state variable. We provide an a priori error analysis that relies on derived
Holder and Sobolev regularity estimates for the optimal variables and error
estimates for an scheme that approximates fractional diffusion on curved
domains; the latter being an extension of previous available results. The
analysis is valid in any dimension. We conclude by presenting some numerical
experiments that validate the derived error estimates.

The lognormal approximation is important because it allows tractable network

Here we conduct a detailed uncertainty analysis of the bimolecular diffusion
coefficient parameters as applied to Titan's upper atmosphere to provide a
better understanding of the impact of uncertainty for this parameter on models.
Because temperature and pressure conditions are much lower than the laboratory
conditions in which bimolecular diffusion parameters were measured, we apply a
Bayesian framework, a problem-agnostic framework, to determine parameter
estimates and associated uncertainties. We solve the Bayesian calibration
problem using the open-source QUESO library which also performs a propagation
of uncertainties in the calibrated parameters to temperature and pressure
conditions observed in Titan's upper atmosphere. Our results show that, after
propagating uncertainty through the Massman model, the uncertainty in molecular
diffusion is highly correlated to temperature and we observe no noticeable
correlation with pressure. We propagate the calibrated molecular diffusion
estimate and associated uncertainty to obtain an estimate with uncertainty due
to bimolecular diffusion for the methane molar fraction as a function of
altitude. Results show that the uncertainty in methane abundance due to
molecular diffusion is in general small compared to eddy diffusion and the
chemical kinetics description. However, methane abundance is most sensitive to
uncertainty in molecular diffusion above 1200 km where the errors are
nontrivial and could have important implications for scientific research based
on diffusion models in this altitude range.

behavior of L-BFGS on the design of 2D frame fields. It involves an energy
function that is infinitly continuous, strongly non linear and having many
local minima. Moreover, the local minima have a clear visual interpretation:
they corresponds to differents frame field topologies. We observe that the
performances of LBFGS are almost unpredictables: they are very competitive when
the field is sampled on the primal graph, but really poor when they are sampled
on the dual graph.

rotating star clusters is modelled by high-accuracy direct N-body simulation.
As in a previous paper on spherical star clusters we study the time evolution
of the stellar tidal disruption rate and the origin of tidally disrupted stars,
now according to several classes of orbits which only occur in axisymmetric
systems (short axis tube and saucer). Compared with that in spherical systems,
we found a higher TD rate in axisymmetric systems. The enhancement can be
explained by an enlarged loss-cone in phase space which is raised from the fact
that total angular momentum $\bf J$ is not conserved. As in the case of
spherical systems, the distribution of the last apocenter distance of tidally
accreted stars peaks at the classical critical radius. However, the angular
distribution of the origin of the accreted stars reveals interesting features.
Inside the influence radius of the supermassive black hole the angular
distribution of disrupted stars has a conspicuous bimodal structure with a
local minimum near the equatorial plane. Outside the influence radius this
dependence is weak. We show that the bimodal structure of orbital parameters
can be explained by the presence of two families of regular orbits, namely
short axis tube and saucer orbits. Also the consequences of our results for the
loss cone in axisymmetric galactic nuclei are presented.

with many interesting applications. We describe a flexible learning framework
based on the concept of nonlinear reaction diffusion models for various image
restoration problems. By embodying recent improvements in nonlinear diffusion
models, we propose a dynamic nonlinear reaction diffusion model with
time-dependent parameters (\ie, linear filters and influence functions). In
contrast to previous nonlinear diffusion models, all the parameters, including
the filters and the influence functions, are simultaneously learned from
training data through a loss based approach. We call this approach TNRD --
\textit{Trainable Nonlinear Reaction Diffusion}. The TNRD approach is
applicable for a variety of image restoration tasks by incorporating
appropriate reaction force. We demonstrate its capabilities with three
representative applications, Gaussian image denoising, single image super
resolution and JPEG deblocking. Experiments show that our trained nonlinear
diffusion models largely benefit from the training of the parameters and
finally lead to the best reported performance on common test datasets for the
tested applications. Our trained models preserve the structural simplicity of
diffusion models and take only a small number of diffusion steps, thus are
highly efficient. Moreover, they are also well-suited for parallel computation
on GPUs, which makes the inference procedure extremely fast.

structured output from a input data vector. The structured outputs include
vector, tree, sequence, etc. We usually assume that we have a training set of
input-output pairs to train the predictor. However, in many real-world appli-
cations, it is difficult to obtain the output for a input, thus for many
training input data points, the structured outputs are missing. In this paper,
we dis- cuss how to learn from a training set composed of some input-output
pairs, and some input data points without outputs. This problem is called semi-
supervised structured output prediction. We propose a novel method for this
problem by constructing a nearest neighbor graph from the input space to
present the manifold structure, and using it to regularize the structured out-
put space directly. We define a slack structured output for each training data
point, and proposed to predict it by learning a structured output predictor.
The learning of both slack structured outputs and the predictor are unified
within one single minimization problem. In this problem, we propose to mini-
mize the structured loss between the slack structured outputs of neighboring
data points, and the prediction error measured by the structured loss. The
problem is optimized by an iterative algorithm. Experiment results over three
benchmark data sets show its advantage.

uncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cell
statistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and their
underlying dark-matter distribution. Our goal is to test the significance of
the clustering information encoded in the $\sigma_v$ measured in the ALHAMBRA
survey. We measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selected
with $B-$band luminosity at $0.35 \leq z < 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion in
the number density distribution derived from the 48 ALHAMBRA subfields. We
compare the observational $\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the dark
matter expected from the theory, $\sigma_{v,{\rm dm}}$. This provides an
estimation of the galaxy bias $b$. The galaxy bias from the cosmic variance is
in excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlation
function analysis in ALHAMBRA. This holds for different redshift bins, for red
and blue subsamples, and for several $B-$band luminosity selections. We find
that $b$ increases with the $B-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expected
from previous work. Moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than blue
galaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\rm rel} = 1.4 \pm 0.2$. Our results
demonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in ALHAMBRA is due to the
clustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\sigma_v$ affecting
pencil-beam surveys. In addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxy
bias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.

w.r.t classical parametric methods. In this paper, adopting Maximum Entropy
arguments, we derive a new $\ell_2$ penalty deriving from a vector-valued

controlling at the same time complexity, measured by the McMillan degree,

the nuclear norm penalty on the squared block Hankel matrix. In contrast with
previous literature on reweighted nuclear norm penalties, our kernel is
described by a small number of hyper-parameters, which are iteratively updated
through marginal likelihood maximization; constraining the structure of the
kernel acts as a (hyper)regularizer which helps controlling the effective

adapt a Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) algorithm which is proved to be
significantly computationally cheaper than other first and second order

is critical for planet formation. To avoid spiralling into the protostar due to
aerodynamic drag, objects must rapidly grow from cm-sized pebbles, which are
tightly coupled to the gas, to large boulders of 1-100m in diameter. It is
already well known that over-densities in the gaseous component of the disc
provide potential sites for the collection of solids, and that significant
density structures in the gaseous component of the disc (e.g., spiral density
waves) can trap solids efficiently enough for the solid component of the disc
to undergo further gravitational collapse due to their own self-gravity. In
this work, we employ the PENCIL CODE to conduct local shearing sheet
simulations of massive self-gravitating protoplanetary discs, to study the
effect of anticyclonic transient vortices, or eddies, on the evolution of
solids in these discs. We find that these types of structures are extremely
efficient at concentrating small and intermediate-sized dust particles with
friction times comparable to, or less than, the local orbital period of the
disc. This can lead to significant over-densities in the solid component of the
disc, with density enhancements comparable to, and even higher, than those
within spiral density waves; increasing the rate of gravitational collapse of
solids into bound structures.

dark atom bound state between a doubly charged technibaryon and a technilepton.
This scenario is consistent with direct search experimental findings because
the dominant SIMP component interacts too strongly to reach the depths of
current detectors with sufficient energy to recoil and the WIMP-like component
is too small to cause significant amount of events. In this context a
metastable technibaryon that decays to $e^+e^+$, $\mu^+ \mu^+$ and $\tau^+
\tau^+$ can in principle explain the observed positron excess by AMS-02 and
PAMELA, while being consistent with the photon flux observed by FERMI/LAT. We
scan the parameters of the model and we find the best possible fit to the
latest experimental data. We find that there is a small range of parameter
space that this scenario can be realised under certain conditions regarding the
cosmic ray propagation and the final state radiation. This range of parameters
fall inside the region where the current run of LHC can probe, and therefore it

telcos to maintain or grow their market share, by providing users with as good
an experience as possible on their network.
  But the task of extracting customer insights from the vast amounts of data
collected by telcos is growing in complexity and scale everey day. How can we
measure and predict the quality of a user's experience on a telco network in
real-time? That is the problem that we address in this paper.
  We present an approach to capture, in (near) real-time, the mobile customer
experience in order to assess which conditions lead the user to place a call to
a telco's customer care center. To this end, we follow a supervised learning
approach for prediction and train our 'Restricted Random Forest' model using,
as a proxy for bad experience, the observed customer transactions in the telco
data feed before the user places a call to a customer care center.
  We evaluate our approach using a rich dataset provided by a major African
telecommunication's company and a novel big data architecture for both the
training and scoring of predictive models. Our empirical study shows our
solution to be effective at predicting user experience by inferring if a
customer will place a call based on his current context.

which will help telcos to reduce churn rates and improve customer experience,

Validity of the popular drift-diffusion approximation is verified against a

code for ions as well as electrons. The fluid models require knowledge of the
momentum exchange frequency and dependence of the ion mobilities on the
electric field when the ions are in equilibrium with the latter. To this end an
auxiliary Monte-Carlo scheme is constructed. It is demonstrated that the
drift-diffusion approximation can overestimate ion transport in simulations of
RF-driven discharges with heavy ion species operated in the $\gamma$ mode at
the atmospheric pressure or in all discharge simulations for lower pressures.
This can lead to exaggerated plasma densities and incorrect profiles provided
by the drift-diffusion models. Therefore, the hybrid code version featuring the
full ion fluid model should be favored against the more popular drfit-diffusion

only a small additional computational cost.

the number of molecules of the conserved species are order parameters whose

what extent is coherence in the working medium an asset for heat machines? The
performance bounds of such a machine are common to (reciprocating) cycles that
consist of consecutive strokes and continuous cycles wherein the periodically
driven system is constantly coupled to cold and hot heat baths. Intriguingly,
we find that the machine's performance strongly depends on the relative
orientations of the transition-dipole vectors in the system. Perfectly aligned
(parallel) transition dipoles allow for steady-state coherence effects, but
also give rise to dark states, which hinder steady-state thermalization and
thus reduce the machine's performance. Similar thermodynamic properties hold
for $N$ two-level atoms conforming to the Dicke model. We conclude that level
degeneracy, but not necessarily coherence, is a thermodynamic resource, equally
enhancing the heat currents and the power output of the heat machine. By
contrast, the efficiency remains unaltered by this degeneracy and adheres to
the Carnot bound.

method is tested for particles experiencing a Stokes viscous drag with a
prescribed fluid velocity field in one dimension using a random flow, and in

as a sequence $x, f_n(x), f_n(f_n(x))$, where $f_n(x) = x + n$, $n$ a nonzero
integer. Thus avoiding three-term arithmetic progressions is equivalent to
containing no three elements of the form $x, f_n(x), f_n(f_n(x))$ with $f_n
\in\mathcal{F}_{\rm t}$, the set of integer translations. One can similarly
construct related progressions using different families of functions. We
investigate several such families, including geometric progressions ($f_n(x) =
nx$ with $n > 1$ a natural number) and exponential progressions ($f_n(x) =
x^n$).
  Progression-free sets are often constructed ""greedily,"" including every
number so long as it is not in progression with any of the previous elements.
Rankin characterized the greedy geometric-progression-free set in terms of the
greedy arithmetic set. We characterize the greedy exponential set and prove
that it has asymptotic density 1, and then discuss how the optimality of the
greedy set depends on the family of functions used to define progressions.
Traditionally, the size of a progression-free set is measured using the (upper)
asymptotic density, however we consider several different notions of density,
including the uniform and exponential densities.

whether transmission spectroscopy is practical with KMOS, and what are the

Ongoing research strives to explore interfacial interactions in a broader class

that at an interface with a tungsten disulfide (WS2) substrate, the strength of
the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in graphene is very strongly enhanced. The
induced SOI leads to a pronounced low-temperature weak anti-localization (WAL)
effect, from which we determine the spin-relaxation time. We find that
spin-relaxation time in graphene is two-to-three orders of magnitude smaller on
WS2 than on SiO2 or hBN, and that it is comparable to the intervalley
scattering time. To interpret our findings we have performed first-principle
electronic structure calculations, which both confirm that carriers in
graphene-on-WS2 experience a strong SOI and allow us to extract a
spin-dependent low-energy effective Hamiltonian. Our analysis further shows
that the use of WS2 substrates opens a possible new route to access topological
states of matter in graphene-based systems.

under different and often unverifiable assumptions. Motivated by the general
challenge of sequentially choosing which algorithm to use, we study the more
specific task of choosing among distributions to use for random hyperparameter
optimization. This work is naturally framed in the extreme bandit setting,
which deals with sequentially choosing which distribution from a collection to
sample in order to minimize (maximize) the single best cost (reward). Whereas
the distributions in the standard bandit setting are primarily characterized by
their means, a number of subtleties arise when we care about the minimal cost
as opposed to the average cost. For example, there may not be a well-defined
""best"" distribution as there is in the standard bandit setting. The best
distribution depends on the rewards that have been obtained and on the
remaining time horizon. Whereas in the standard bandit setting, it is sensible
to compare policies with an oracle which plays the single best arm, in the
extreme bandit setting, there are multiple sensible oracle models. We define a
sensible notion of ""extreme regret"" in the extreme bandit setting, which
parallels the concept of regret in the standard bandit setting. We then prove
that no policy can asymptotically achieve no extreme regret.

account, another picture of the {\pi} electron state emerges. These

formation. The atomically flat layer can be regarded as a simplest
quasi-two-dimensional mesoscopic quantum system consisting of a carbon ion
plane and two {\pi} electron crystals on opposite sides of the plane. Such a

sensitivity to external factors distorting its electron crystals. The

into a more stable carbon modification with a rolled-up or wrapped-up carbon

describe a procedure to adiabatically prepare one of the doubly-degenerate

exhibit scattered profiles, and the rest are only weakly detected. A
qualitative comparison of LOFAR profiles with those at higher radio frequencies
shows constant separation between profile components. Similarly, the profile
widths are consistent with those observed at higher frequencies, unless
scattering dominates at the lowest frequencies. This is very different from
what is observed for normal pulsars and suggests a compact emission region in
the MSP magnetosphere. The amplitude ratio of the profile components, on the
other hand, can dramatically change towards low frequencies, often with the
trailing component becoming dominant. As previously demonstrated this can be
caused by aberration and retardation. This data set enables high-precision
studies of pulse profile evolution with frequency, dispersion, Faraday

etal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 086403 (2013)] to compute steady state properties
of strongly correlated electronic systems out of equilibrium. The method can be
considered as a non-equilibrium generalization of exact diagonalization based
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The key modification for the
non-equilibrium situation consists in addressing the DMFT impurity problem
within an auxiliary system consisting of the correlated impurity, $N_b$
uncorrelated bath sites and two Markovian environments (sink and reservoir).
Algorithmic improvements in the impurity solver allow to treat efficiently
larger values of $N_b$ than previously in DMFT. This increases the accuracy of
the results and is crucial for a correct description of the physical behavior
of the system in the relevant parameter range including a semi-quantitative
description of the Kondo regime. To illustrate the approach we consider a
monoatomic layer of correlated orbitals, described by the single-band Hubbard
model, attached to two metallic leads. The non-equilibrium situation is driven
by a bias-voltage applied to the leads. For this system, we investigate the
spectral function and the steady state current-voltage characteristics in the
weakly as well as in the strongly interacting limit. In particular we
investigate the non-equilibrium behavior of quasi-particle excitations within
the Mott gap of the correlated layer. We find for low bias voltage Kondo like
behavior in the vicinity of the insulating phase. In particular we observe a
splitting of the Kondo resonance as a function of the bias voltage.

important role of diffuse, scattered radiation in determining both the topology
of steady-state solutions and intrinsic variability in the transonic wind base.
We use a smooth source function formalism to obtain nonlocal, integral
expressions for the direct and diffuse components of the line-force that
account for deviations from the usual localized, Sobolev forms. As the
scattering source function is reduced, we find the solution topology in the
transonic region transitions from X-type, with a unique wind solution, to a
nodal type, characterized by a degenerate family of solutions.
  Specifically, in the idealized case of an optically thin source function and
a uniformly bright stellar disk, the unique X-type solution proves to be a
stable attractor to which time-dependent numerical radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations relax. But in models where the scattering strength is only modestly
reduced, the topology instead turns nodal, with the associated solution
degeneracy now manifest by intrinsic structure and variability that persist
down to the photospheric wind base. This highlights the potentially crucial
role of diffuse radiation for the dynamics and variability of line-driven
winds, and seriously challenges the use of Sobolev theory in the transonic wind
region. Since such Sobolev-based models are commonly used in broad applications
like stellar evolution and feedback, this prompts development of new wind
models, not only for further quantifying the intrinsic variability found here,
but also for computing new theoretical predictions of global properties like
velocity laws and mass-loss rates.

estimated by examining differences of measured line integrated electron
densities (TEC) that are scaled to equivalent vertical integrated densities.
The spatio-temporal variability, instrumentation dependent errors, and errors
due to inaccurate ionospheric altitude profile assumptions are modeled as
structure functions. These structure functions determine how the TEC
differences are weighted in the linear least-squares minimization procedure,
which is used to produce the bias estimates. A method for automatic detection
and removal of outlier measurements that do not fit into a model of receiver
bias is also described. The same statistical framework can be used for a single
receiver station, but it also scales to a large global network of receivers. In
addition to the Global Positioning System (GPS), the method is also applicable
to other dual frequency GNSS systems, such as GLONASS (Globalnaya
Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema). The use of the framework is demonstrated
in practice through several examples. A specific implementation of the methods
presented here are used to compute GPS receiver biases for measurements in the
MIT Haystack Madrigal distributed database system. Results of the new algorithm
are compared with the current MIT Haystack Observatory MAPGPS bias

that full problem solving requires a functional semantics on an infinite

inverse-volume, to both of the cosmological background evolution and
perturbations. In this paper, using {\em the third-order uniform asymptotic
approximations}, we derive explicitly the observational quantities of the
slow-roll inflation in the framework of LQC with these quantum corrections. We
calculate the power spectra, spectral indices, and running of the spectral
indices for both scalar and tensor perturbations, whereby the tensor-to-scalar
ratio is obtained. We expand all the observables at the time when the
inflationary mode crosses the Hubble horizon. As the upper error bounds for the
uniform asymptotic approximation at the third-order are $\lesssim 0.15\%$,
these results represent the most accurate results obtained so far in the
