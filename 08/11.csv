magnetic stability of pure cobalt in hexagonal close packed (HCP), face
centered cubic (FCC) and body centered cubic (BCC) structures are reviewed. At
equilibrium, non-spin polarized (NSP) and spin polarized (SP) calculations of
the energy versus volume show that the ground state is ferromagnetic in both

moments of Co atoms in Co$_4$N nitride respectively belonging to two different
crystallographic sites are studied over a wide range of the cubic lattice
constant, and a comparison with the FCC-cobalt one is given. The volume
expansion in the nitride indicates that the corner Co$^{I}$ atoms show
localized magnetism while face center Co$^{II}$ atoms exhibit an itinerant
behavior. Like in FCC-Fe/Fe$_{4}$N, a ""low volume-low moment"" and ""large
volume-high moment"" behavior is observed for FCC-Co/Co$_4$N. The density of
states of the Co$_{4}$N ferromagnetic ground state is interpreted within the

$\varepsilon$ with $O(\varepsilon^{-2} (\log \varepsilon)^5)$ complexity, in

prove a variance scaling result that strongly suggests similar performance of

gives an excellent representation of the core of M87 core covering ten orders
of magnitude in frequency for both the active and the quiescent phases. The
inferred total jet power is, however, one to two orders of magnitude lower than
the jet mechanical power reported in the literature. The maximum luminosity of
a thin accretion disc allowed by the data yields an accretion rate of $< 6

suffices to explain M87 radiative luminosity at the jet-frame, it is however
two to three order of magnitude below that required to account for the jet's

power of M87 to have been two to three orders of magnitude higher in the last
200 yr. Alternatively, an extra source of power may derive from black hole

the lifetime limitation of battery-powered systems. In this paper, we study a
sensor network built from battery-free sensor nodes which harvest energy from
radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by RF-based chargers, e.g., radio
frequency identification (RFID) readers. Due to the insufficiency of harvested
energy, the sensor nodes have to work in duty cycles to harvest enough energy
before turning active and performing tasks. One fundamental issue in this kind
of network design is how to deploy the chargers to ensure that the battery-free

new wireless recharge model, we formulate the charger placement problem for
node's duty cycle guarantee as a constrained optimization problem. We develop
both greedy and efficient heuristics for solving the problem and validate our
solutions through extensive simulations. The simulation results show that the
proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based divide-and-conquer approach

common assumption that the missing baryons are in the form of the Warm Hot

density can be used as a tracer of the WHIM. The latter assumption is supported
by our finding of a significant correlation between the WHIM density and the
galaxy luminosity density in the hydrodynamical simulations of Cui et al.
(2012). We further found that the fraction of the gas mass in the WHIM phase is
substantially (by a factor of $\sim$1.6) higher within the large scale galactic
filaments, i.e. $\sim$70\%, compared to the average in the full simulation
volume of $\sim$0.1\,Gpc$^3$. The relation between the WHIM overdensity and the
galaxy luminosity overdensity within the galactic filaments is consistent with
linear: $\delta_{\rm whim}\,=\,0.7\,\pm\,0.1\,\times\,\delta_\mathrm{LD}^{0.9
\pm 0.2}$. We applied our procedure to the line of sight to the blazar
H2356-309 and found evidence for the WHIM in correspondence of the Sculptor
Wall (z $\sim$0.03 and $\log{N_H}$ = $19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$) and Pisces-Cetus
superclusters (z $\sim$0.06 and $\log{N_H}$ = $19.7^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$), in
agreement with the redshifts and column densities of the X-ray absorbers
identified and studied by Fang et al. (2010) and Zappacosta et al. (2010). This
agreement indicates that the galaxy luminosity density and galactic filaments
are reliable signposts for the WHIM and that our method is robust in estimating
the WHIM density. The signal that we detected cannot originate from the halos
of the nearby galaxies since they cannot account for the large WHIM column
densities that our method and X-ray analysis consistently find in the Sculptor
Wall and Pisces-Cetus superclusters.

candidate atomic structures have been identified for each experimentally

energetically favoured at a broad range of pressures up to 400 GPa, where it is
known experimentally that hydrogen is nonmetallic. Here we show that more
advanced theoretical methods (diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations) find

the formation of a number of intermediate phases (depending on the solid
solution composition and the synthesis temperature). Single phase solid
solutions have been manufactured when the sintering temperature was increased
to 1000-1100 C. An increase of the concentration of the substituting ions
results in a linear increase in the size of the crystal cell. As a consequence
the reduction of the tolerance factor and an increase of the stability of the
antiferroelectric phase with respect to the ferroelectric one take place.

away from the Fermi surface in doped Mott insulators using the dynamical

hole doping, the magnitude of the self-energy for imaginary frequencies at the
top of the band (k=(pi,pi) is enhanced with respect to the self-energy
magnitude at the bottom of the band (k=(0,0)). The self-energy behavior at
these two k-points is switched for electron doping. Although the hybridization
is much larger for (0,0) than for (pi,pi), we demonstrate that this is not the
origin of this difference. Isolated clusters under a downward shift of the
chemical potential, mu<U/2, at half-filling reproduce the overall self-energy
behavior at (0,0) and (pi,pi) found in low hole doped embedded clusters. This
happens although there is no change in the electronic structure of the isolated

which weakly hole dopes the Mott insulator can lead to a large enhancement of
the (pi,pi) self-energy which is not necessarily associated with electronic
correlation effects, even in embedded clusters.

pervasive wireless applications. One promis- ing approach is to locate users
with radio frequency fingerprints. However, its wide adoption in real-world
systems is challenged by the time- and manpower-consuming site survey process,
which builds a fingerprint database a priori for localization. To address this
problem, we visualize the 3-D RF fingerprint data as a function of locations
(x-y) and indices of access points (fingerprint), as a tensor and use tensor
algebraic methods for an adaptive tubal-sampling of this fingerprint space. In
particular using a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework in [1] we
capture the complexity of the fingerprint space as a low-dimensional
tensor-column space. In this formulation the proposed scheme exploits
adaptivity to identify reference points which are highly informative for
learning this low-dimensional space. Further, under certain incoherency
conditions we prove that the proposed scheme achieves bounded recovery error
and near-optimal sampling complexity. In contrast to several existing work that
rely on random sampling, this paper shows that adaptivity in sampling can lead
to significant improvements in localization accuracy. The approach is validated
on both data generated by the ray-tracing indoor model which accounts for the
floor plan and the impact of walls and the real world data. Simulation results
show that, while maintaining the same localization accuracy of existing
approaches, the amount of samples can be cut down by 71% for the high SNR case

of see-saw mechanisms. The model is motivated by several small mixing and mass
parameters indicated by the data. These are $\theta_{13}$, the solar mass
splitting, and the small deviation of $\theta_{23}$ from maximal mixing (=
$\pi/4$). We take the above as indications that at some level the small
quantities are well-approximated by zero. In particular the mixing angles, to a
zero order, should be either 0 or $\pi/4$. Accordingly, in this model the
Type-II see-saw dominates and generates the larger atmospheric mass splitting
and sets $\theta_{23} = \pi/4$. The other mixing angles are vanishing as is the
solar splitting. We show how the $A4$ assignment for the lepton doublets leads
to this form. We also specify the $A4$ properties of the right-handed neutrinos
which result in a smaller Type-I see-saw contribution that acts as a
perturbation and shifts the angles $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{13}$ into the
correct range and the desired value of $\Delta m^2_{solar}$ is produced. The
$A4$ symmetry results in relationships between these quantities as well as with
a small deviation of $\theta_{23}$ from $\pi/4$. If the right-handed neutrino
mass matrix, $M_R$, is chosen real then there is no leptonic CP-violation and
only Normal Ordering is admissible. If $M_R$ is complex then Inverted Ordering
is also allowed with the proviso that the CP-phase, $\delta$, is large, i.e.,
$\sim \pi/2$ or $-\pi/2$. The preliminary results from NO$\nu$A favouring
Normal Ordering and $\delta$ near $-\pi/2$ imply quasi-degenerate neutrino
masses in this model.

heavy-ion collisions in bins of centrality obtained from final state
multiplicity averages out the various initial configurations and thus restricts
the study to only a limited range of initial conditions. In this paper, we
propose an additional binning in terms of total spectator neutrons in an event.
This offers us a key control parameter to probe events with broader range of
initial conditions providing us an opportunity to peep into events with rarer
initial conditions which otherwise get masked when analysed by centrality
binning alone. We find that the inclusion of spectator binning allows one to
vary $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ independently. We observe that the
standard scaling relation between $\displaystyle{v_2/\varepsilon_2}$ and
$\frac{1}{S}\frac{dN_{\text{ch}}}{d\eta}$ exhibited by centrality bins is
broken by the spectator neutron bins. However, the acoustic scaling relation
between $\displaystyle{\ln\left( v_n/\varepsilon_n\right)}$ and transverse
system size holds for both centrality as well as spectator bins for central to
mid-central collisions. The introduction of the spectator binning allows us to
tune over a wide range viscosity driven effects for events with varying initial

techniques to study the materials (pigments, drawing materials and paper) and
painting techniques of watercolour paintings is presented. The non-invasive
imaging and spectroscopic techniques include VIS-NIR reflectance spectroscopy
and multispectral imaging, micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence
spectroscopy (XRF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The three
spectroscopic techniques complement each other in pigment identification.
Multispectral imaging (near infrared bands), OCT and micro-Raman complement
each other in the visualisation and identification of the drawing material. OCT
probes the microstructure and light scattering properties of the substrate
while XRF detects the elemental composition that indicates the sizing methods
and the filler content. The multiple techniques were applied in a study of
forty six 19th century Chinese export watercolours from the Victoria & Albert
Museum (V&A) and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) to examine to what
extent the non-invasive analysis techniques employed complement each other and
how much useful information about the paintings can be extracted to address art
conservation and history questions. A micro-destructive technique of microfade
spectrometry was used to assess the vulnerability of the paintings to light
exposure.

  characters"", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file",,,,"stat.ML cs.CC cs.DC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been a recent interest in understanding the power of local
algorithms for optimization and inference problems on sparse graphs. Gamarnik
and Sudan (2014) showed that local algorithms are weaker than global algorithms
for finding large independent sets in sparse random regular graphs. Montanari
(2015) showed that local algorithms are suboptimal for finding a community with
high connectivity in the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. For the
symmetric planted partition problem (also named community detection for the
block models) on sparse graphs, a simple observation is that local algorithms
cannot have non-trivial performance.
  In this work we consider the effect of side information on local algorithms
for community detection under the binary symmetric stochastic block model. In
the block model with side information each of the $n$ vertices is labeled $+$
or $-$ independently and uniformly at random; each pair of vertices is
connected independently with probability $a/n$ if both of them have the same
label or $b/n$ otherwise. The goal is to estimate the underlying vertex
labeling given 1) the graph structure and 2) side information in the form of a
vertex labeling positively correlated with the true one. Assuming that the
ratio between in and out degree $a/b$ is $\Theta(1)$ and the average degree $
(a+b) / 2 = n^{o(1)}$, we characterize three different regimes under which a
local algorithm, namely, belief propagation run on the local neighborhoods,
maximizes the expected fraction of vertices labeled correctly. Thus, in
contrast to the case of symmetric block models without side information, we
show that local algorithms can achieve optimal performance for the block model
with side information.

the results and number of grid nodes. In the context of the finite volume
method no single local refinement criterion has been globally established as
optimum for the selection of the control volumes to subdivide, since it is not
easy to associate the discretisation error with an easily computable quantity
in each control volume. Often the grid refinement criterion is based on an
estimate of the truncation error in each control volume, because the truncation
error is a natural measure of the discrepancy between the algebraic
finite-volume equations and the original differential equations. However, it is
not a straightforward task to associate the truncation error with the optimum
grid density because of the complexity of the relationship between truncation
and discretisation errors. In the present work several criteria based on a
truncation error estimate are tested and compared on a regularised lid-driven
cavity case at various Reynolds numbers. It is shown that criteria where the
truncation error is weighted by the volume of the grid cells perform better
than using just the truncation error as the criterion. Also it is observed that
the efficiency of local refinement increases with the Reynolds number. The
truncation error is estimated by restricting the solution to a coarser grid and
applying the coarse grid discrete operator. The complication that high
truncation error develops at grid level interfaces is also investigated and
several treatments are tested.

allows the study of several aspects of the matter distribution in the Universe,
such as evaluating semi-analytic models of galaxy formation or imposing
constraints on cosmological models. Consequently, it is important to have a
reliable method for estimating this statistic, taking full advantage of the
available information on current and future galaxy surveys. Aims. The main goal
of this project is to combine photometric and spectroscopic information using a
discount method of background galaxies in order to extend the range of absolute
magnitudes and to increase the upper limit of masses in which the HOD is
estimated. We also evaluate the proposed method and apply it to estimating the
HOD on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) galaxy survey.
Methods. We propose the background subtraction technique to mel information
provided by spectroscopic galaxy groups and photometric survey of galaxies. To
evaluate the feasibility of the method, we implement the proposed technique on
a mock catalogue built from a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.
Furthermore, we apply the method to the SDSS DR7 using a galaxy group catalogue
taken from spectroscopic version and the corresponding photometric galaxy
survey. Results. We demonstrated the validity of the method using the mock
catalogue.We applied this technique to obtain the SDSS DR7 HOD in absolute
magnitudes ranging from $M=-21.5$ to $M=-16.0$ and masses up to $\simeq 10^{15}
M_{\odot}$ throughout this range. On the brighter extreme, we found that our
results are in excellent agreement with those obtained in previous works.

about embeddings (maps without double points), we study the question whether a
finite simplicial complex K can be mapped into R^d without triple, quadruple,
or, more generally, r-fold points. Specifically, we are interested in maps f
from K to R^d that have no r-Tverberg points, i.e., no r-fold points with
preimages in r pairwise disjoint simplices of K, and we seek necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of such maps.
  We present a higher-multiplicity analogue of the completeness of the Van
Kampen obstruction for embeddability in twice the dimension. Specifically, we
show that under suitable restrictions on the dimensions, a well-known Deleted
Product Criterion (DPC) is not only necessary but also sufficient for the
existence of maps without r-Tverberg points. Our main technical tool is a
higher-multiplicity version of the classical Whitney trick.
  An important guiding idea for our work was that sufficiency of the DPC,
together with an old result of Ozaydin on the existence of equivariant maps,
might yield an approach to disproving the remaining open cases of the
long-standing topological Tverberg conjecture. Unfortunately, our proof of the
sufficiency of the DPC requires a ""codimension 3"" proviso, which is not
satisfied for when K is the N-simplex.
  Recently, Frick found an extremely elegant way to overcome this last
""codimension 3"" obstacle and to construct counterexamples to the topological
Tverberg conjecture for d at least 3r+1 (r not a prime power). Here, we present
a different construction that yields counterexamples for d at least 3r (r not a

times, which means that they are described by functions with compact support,
which we will also take to be smooth. Here we study the probability
distributions for stress tensor operators averaged with such functions of time,
in the vacuum state of a massless free field. Our primary aim is to understand
the asymptotic form of the distribution which describes the probability of
large vacuum fluctuations. Our approach involves asymptotic estimates for the
high moments of the distribution. These estimates in turn may be used to obtain
estimates for the asymptotic form of the probability distribution. Our results
show that averaging over a finite interval results in a probability
distribution which falls more slowly than for the case of Lorentzian averaging,
and both fall more slowly than exponentially. This indicates that vacuum
fluctuations effects can dominate over thermal fluctuations in some
circumstances.

revealed that the spin-axes of massive (M > ~1.2 solar masses) stars often
exhibit substantial misalignments with respect to the orbits of the planets
they host. Conversely, lower-mass stars tend to only have limited obliquities.
A similar trend has recently emerged within the observational dataset of young
stars' magnetic field strengths: massive T-Tauri stars tend to have dipole
fields that are ~10 times weaker than their less-massive counterparts. Here we
show that the associated dependence of magnetic star-disk torques upon stellar
mass naturally explains the observed spin-orbit misalignment trend, provided
that misalignments are obtained within the disk-hosting phase. Magnetic torques
act to realign the stellar spin-axes of lower-mass stars with the disk plane on
a timescale significantly shorter than the typical disk lifetime, whereas the
same effect operates on a much longer timescale for massive stars.
Cumulatively, our results point to a primordial excitation of extrasolar
spin-orbit misalignment, signalling consistency with disk-driven migration as
the dominant transport mechanism for short-period planets. Furthermore, we
predict that spin-orbit misalignments in systems where close-in planets show
signatures of dynamical, post-nebular emplacement will not follow the observed
correlation with stellar mass.

  low luminosity of stellar tidal disruption events","8 pages, Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stx117",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models for tidal disruption events (TDEs) in which a supermassive black hole
disrupts a star commonly assume that the highly eccentric streams of bound
stellar debris promptly form a circular accretion disk at the pericenter scale.
However, recent numerical simulations (Shiokawa et al., 2015) demonstrated that
dissipation via hydrodynamical shocks is insufficient to circularize debris,
and the flow retains its initial semi-major axis scale throughout the first ~10
orbits of the event. The bolometric peak luminosity of most TDE candidates, a
few x 10^{44} erg/s, implies that we observe only ~1% of the energy expected
from radiatively efficient accretion. Motivated by these results, (Piran et
al., 2015) suggested that the observed optical TDE emission is powered by
shocks at the apocenter between freshly infalling material and earlier arriving
matter. This model explains the small radiated energy, the low temperature, and
the large radius implied by the observations as well as the t^{-5/3} light
curve. However the question of the system's low {bolometric} efficiency remains
unanswered. We suggest that the high orbital energy and low angular momentum of
the flow make it possible for magnetic stresses to reduce the matter's already
small angular momentum to the point at which it can fall ballistically into the
SMBH before circularization. As a result, the efficiency is only ~1--10% of a
standard accretion disk's efficiency. Thus, the intrinsically high eccentricity

He II at 4686 angstrom, H alpha, and, for the first time, H I at 10906 angstrom

of the chromosphere of a rotating accretion disk. Nonetheless, the paucity of
disk features points towards a low level of irradiation in the system. This is
confirmed through spectral energy distribution modeling and we find that the
UVOT+X-shooter continuum mostly stems from the thermal emission of a viscous
disk. We speculate that the absence of reprocessing is due to the compactness
of an illumination-induced envelope that fails to reflect enough incoming hard
X-ray photons back to the outer regions. The disk also marginally contributes
to the Compton-dominated X-ray emission and is strongly truncated, with an
inner radius about a thousand times larger than the black hole's gravitational
radius. A near-infrared excess is present, and we associate it with synchrotron
radiation from a compact jet. However, the measured X-ray flux is significantly
higher than what can be explained by the optically thin synchrotron jet
component. We discuss these findings in the framework of the radio quiet versus
X-ray bright hypothesis, favoring the presence of a residual disk, predicted by
evaporation models, that contributes to the X-ray emission without enhancing
the radio flux.

field, these signatures include thermonuclear transients from burning during
maximum compression. We combine a hydrodynamic simulation that includes nuclear
burning of the disruption of a $0.6 M_\odot$ C/O WD with a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer calculation to synthesize the properties of a representative
transient. The transient's emission emerges in the optical, with lightcurves
and spectra reminiscent of type I SNe. The properties are strongly
viewing-angle dependent, and key spectral signatures are $\approx 10,000$ km
s$^{-1}$ Doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the unbound ejecta.
Disruptions of He WDs likely produce large quantities of intermediate-mass
elements, offering a possible production mechanism for Ca-rich transients.
Accompanying multiwavelength transients are fueled by accretion and arise from
the nascent accretion disk and relativistic jet. If MBHs of moderate mass exist
with number densities similar to those of supermassive MBHs, both high energy
wide-field monitors and upcoming optical surveys should detect tens to hundreds
of WD tidal disruptions per year. The current best strategy for their detection
may therefore be deep optical follow up of high-energy transients of
unusually-long duration. The detection rate or the non-detection of these
transients by current and upcoming surveys can thus be used to place meaningful
constraints on the extrapolation of the MBH mass function to moderate masses.

between the colours and specific star formation rates (SFR/$M_*$) of galaxies
on large scales: 1) the formation times of their surrounding dark matter halos
are correlated (commonly referred to as ""assembly bias""), 2) gas is heated over
large scales at early times, leading to coherent modulation of cooling and star
formation between well-separated galaxies (commonly referred to as
""pre-heating"") . To distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly bias
scenarios, we search for relics of energetic feedback events in the
neighbourhood of central galaxies with different specific star formation rates.
We find a significant excess of very high mass ($\log M_* > 11.3$) galaxies out
to a distance of 2.5 Mpc around low SFR/$M_*$ central galaxies compared to
control samples of higher SFR/$M_*$ central galaxies with the same stellar mass
and redshift. We also find that very massive galaxies in the neighbourhood of
low SFR/$M_*$ galaxies have much higher probability of hosting radio loud
active galactic nuclei. The radio-loud AGN fraction in neighbours with $\log
M_* > 11.3$ is four times higher around passive, non star-forming centrals at
projected distances of 1 Mpc and two times higher at projected distances of 4
Mpc. Finally, we carry out an investigation of conformity effects in the
recently publicly-released Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation,
which includes energetic input both from quasars and from radio mode accretion
onto black holes. We do not find conformity effects of comparable amplitude on
large scales in the simulations and we propose that gas needs to be pushed out
of dark matter halos more efficiently at high redshifts.

significantly to the observed type Ia supernova rate. In this paper, we study
the ignition and propagation of detonation through post-merger remnants and we
follow the resulting nucleosynthesis up to the point where a homologous

of Dyson spheres to harvest radiation energy, this could affect the
characteristics of their host galaxies. Potential signatures of such
astroengineering projects include reduced optical luminosity, boosted infrared
luminosity and morphological anomalies. Here, we apply a technique pioneered by
Annis (1999) to search for Kardashev type III civilizations in disk galaxies,
based on the predicted offset of these galaxies from the optical Tully-Fisher
relation. By analyzing a sample of 1359 disk galaxies, we are able to set a
conservative upper limit at 3% on the fraction of local disks subject to
Dysonian astroengineering on galaxy-wide scales. However, the available data
suggests that a small subset of disk galaxies actually may be underluminous
with respect to the Tully-Fisher relation in the way expected for Kardashev
type III objects. Based on the optical morphologies and infrared-to-optical
luminosity ratios of such galaxies in our sample, we conclude that none of them
stand out as strong Kardashev type III candidates and that their inferred
properties likely have mundane explanations. This allows us to set a tentative
upper limit at 0.3% on the fraction of Karashev type III disk galaxies in the
local Universe.

the available ribosomes has important implications to the cell's functioning
and evolution. Developing a better understanding of the intricate correlations
between these simultaneous processes, rather than focusing on the translation
of a single isolated transcript, should help in gaining a better understanding
of mRNA translation regulation and the way elongation rates affect organismal
fitness. A model of simultaneous translation is specifically important when
dealing with highly expressed genes, as these consume more resources. In
addition, such a model can lead to more accurate predictions that are needed in
the interconnection of translational modules in synthetic biology. We develop
and analyze a general model for large-scale simultaneous mRNA translation and
competition for ribosomes. This is based on combining several ribosome flow
models (RFMs) interconnected via a pool of free ribosomes. We prove that the
compound system always converges to a steady-state and that it always entrains
or phase locks to periodically time-varying transition rates in any of the mRNA
molecules. We use this model to explore the interactions between the various
mRNA molecules and ribosomes at steady-state. We show that increasing the
length of an mRNA molecule decreases the production rate of all the mRNAs.
Increasing any of the codon translation rates in a specific mRNA molecule
yields a local effect: an increase in the translation rate of this mRNA, and
also a global effect: the translation rates in the other mRNA molecules all
increase or all decrease. These results suggest that the effect of codon
decoding rates of endogenous and heterologous mRNAs on protein production is
more complicated than previously thought.

polynomial vector field on $\mathbb{C}^2$ completely determined (up to affine
equivalence) by the spectra of its singularities? We will see that for
quadratic vector fields this is not the case: given a generic quadratic vector
field there is, up to affine equivalence, exactly one other vector field which
has the same spectra of singularities. Moreover, we will see that we can always
assume that both vector fields have the same singular locus and at each
singularity both vector fields have the same spectrum. Let us say that two
vector fields are twin vector fields if they have the same singular locus and
the same spectrum at each singularity.
  To formalize the above claim we shall prove the following: any two generic
quadratic vector fields with the same spectra of singularities (yet possibly
different singular locus) can be transformed by suitable affine maps to be
either the same vector field or a pair of twin vector fields.
  We then analyze the case of quadratic Hamiltonian vector fields in more
detail and find necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of
non-zero complex numbers to arise as the spectra of singularities of a
quadratic Hamiltonian vector field.

determined (up to affine equivalence) by the spectra of its singularities

methylammonium orientation, the water molecule can infiltrate into the hollow
site of the surface and get trapped. Controlling dipole orientation via poling
or interfacial engineering could thus enhance its moisture stability. We do not
see a direct reaction between the water and methylammonium molecules.
Furthermore, calculations with an implicit solvation model indicate that a
higher water concentration may facilitate degradation.

and has drawn the attention of scientists for several decades. The stream is
unusual, among others, for several reasons: its very short duration around
maximum activity (~12 - 14 hours) as detected by visual, photographic and radar
observations, its recent onset (around 1835 AD) and because it had been the
only major stream without an obvious parent body until 2003. Ever since, there
have been debates as to the age of the stream and the nature of its proposed
parent body, asteroid 2003 EH1.
  In this work, we present results on the most probable age and formation
mechanism of the narrow portion of the Quadrantid meteoroid stream. For the
first time we use data on eight high precision photographic Quadrantids,
equivalent to gram - kilogram size, to constrain the most likely age of the
core of the stream. Out of eight high-precision photographic Quadrantids, five
pertain directly to the narrow portion of the stream. In addition, we also use
data on five high-precision radar Quadrantids, observed within the peak of the
shower.
  We performed backwards numerical integrations of the equations of motion of a
large number of 'clones' of both, the eight high-precision photographic and
five radar Quadrantid meteors, along with the proposed parent body, 2003 EH1.
According to our results, from the backward integrations, the most likely age
of the narrow structure of the Quadrantids is between 200 - 300 years. These
presumed ejection epochs, corresponding to 1700 - 1800 AD, are then used for
forward integrations of large numbers of hypothetical meteoroids, ejected from
the parent 2003 EH$_1$, until the present epoch. The aim is to constrain
whether the core of the Quadrantid meteoroid stream is consistent with a
previously proposed relatively young age (~ 200 years).}

the excess is compatible with a compressed stop spectrum and is not excluded by
any other relevant search, finding some regions of parameter space with signal

largest number of Hamming neighbors of a point which differ from it in function
value). The structure of smooth or equivalently low-sensitivity functions is
still a mystery. A well-known conjecture states that every such Boolean
function can be computed by a shallow decision tree. While this conjecture
implies that smooth functions are easy to compute in the simplest computational
model, to date no non-trivial upper bounds were known for such functions in any
computational model, including unrestricted Boolean circuits. Even a bound on
the description length of such functions better than the trivial $2^n$ does not
seem to have been known.
  In this work, we establish the first computational upper bounds on smooth
Boolean functions:
  1) We show that every sensitivity s function is uniquely specified by its
values on a Hamming ball of radius 2s. We use this to show that such functions
can be computed by circuits of size $n^{O(s)}$.
  2) We show that sensitivity s functions satisfy a strong pointwise
noise-stability guarantee for random noise of rate O(1/s). We use this to show
that these functions have formulas of depth O(s log n).
  3) We show that sensitivity s functions can be (locally) self-corrected from
worst-case noise of rate $\exp(-O(s))$.
  All our results are simple, and follow rather directly from (variants of) the
basic fact that that the function value at few points in small neighborhoods of
a given point determine its function value via a majority vote. Our results
confirm various consequences of the conjecture. They may be viewed as providing
a new form of evidence towards its validity, as well as new directions towards
attacking it.

be written as $\Delta H(\rho_m, \rho) + \langle \mathcal{Q}\rangle_{F|m}\geq

fundamental challenge for the algorithmic strategies results from the fact that
particles may run through the grid without velocity constraints. To facilitate
this, we rely on multiscale grid representations. They allow us to lift and
drop particles between different spatial resolutions. We call this cell-based
strategy particle in tree (PIT). Our second approach assigns particles to
vertices describing a dual grid (PIDT) and augments the lifts and drops with
multiscale linked cells.
  Our experiments validate the two schemes at hands of an electrostatic
particle-in-cell code by retrieving the dispersion relation of Langmuir waves
in a thermal plasma. They reveal that different particle and grid
characteristics favour different realisations. The possibility that particles
can tunnel through an arbitrary number of grid cells implies that most data is
exchanged between neighbouring ranks, while very few data is transferred
non-locally. This constraints the scalability as the code potentially has to
realise global communication. We show that the merger of an analysed tree

outperform several established implementations based upon trees and/or

Solar eruptions and high flare activity often accompany the rapid
rotation of sunspots. The study of sunspot rotation and the mechanisms driving
this motion are therefore key to our understanding of how the solar atmosphere
attains the conditions necessary for large energy release.
  Aims. We aim to demonstrate and investigate the rotation of sunspots in a 3D
numerical experiment of the emergence of a magnetic flux tube as it rises
through the solar interior and emerges into the atmosphere. Furthermore, we
seek to show that the sub-photospheric twist stored in the interior is injected
into the solar atmosphere by means of a definitive rotation of the sunspots.
  Methods. A numerical experiment is performed to solve the 3D resistive
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a Lagrangian-Remap code. We track the
emergence of a toroidal flux tube as it rises through the solar interior and
emerges into the atmosphere investigating various quantities related to both
the magnetic field and plasma.
  Results. Through detailed analysis of the numerical experiment, we find clear
evidence that the photospheric footprints or sunspots of the flux tube undergo
a rotation. Significant vertical vortical motions are found to develop within
the two polarity sources after the field emerges. These rotational motions are
found to leave the interior portion of the field untwisted and twist up the
atmospheric portion of the field. This is shown by our analysis of the relative
magnetic helicity as a significant portion of the interior helicity is
transported to the atmosphere. In addition, there is a substantial transport of
magnetic energy to the atmosphere. Rotation angles are also calculated by
tracing selected fieldlines; the fieldlines threading through the sunspot are
found to rotate through angles of up to 353 degrees over the course of the
experiment.

coupling method is very flexible, and it has shown initial promise by providing
improved algorithms for packing and covering linear programs. Somewhat
surprisingly, however, while the dependence of the convergence rate on the
error parameter $\epsilon$ for packing problems was improved to
$O(1/\epsilon)$, which corresponds to what accelerated gradient methods are
designed to achieve, the dependence for covering problems was only improved to
$O(1/\epsilon^{1.5})$, and even that required a different more complicated

and since previous algorithms for these very related problems have led to the

the question of the exact role that the linear coupling is playing in
coordinating the complementary gradient and mirror descent step of the

algorithms for packing and covering linear programs, illustrating that the
linear coupling method can lead to improved $O(1/\epsilon)$ dependence for both
packing and covering problems in a unified manner, i.e., with the same

corresponding recursion tree defines an additional lattice
$\mathcal{B}^*_{\Gamma}$, whose elements are certain subgames $\Gamma'\subseteq
\Gamma$ that we call basic subgames. The extremal-SEPMs of a given \MPG
$\Gamma$ coincide with the least-SEPMs of the basic subgames of $\Gamma$; so,
$\mathcal{X}^*_{\Gamma}$ is the energy-lattice comprising all and only the
least-SEPMs of the \emph{basic} subgames of $\Gamma$. The complexity of the
proposed enumeration for both $\mathcal{B}^*_{\Gamma}$ and
$\mathcal{X}^*_{\Gamma}$ is $O(|V|^3|E|W |\mathcal{B}^*_{\Gamma}|)$ total time
and $O(|V||E|)+\Theta\big(|E| \mathcal{B}^*_{\Gamma}|\big)$ working space.
Finally, it is constructed an \MPG $\Gamma$ for which $|\mathcal{B}^*_{\Gamma}|
> |\mathcal{X}^*_\Gamma|$, this proves that $\mathcal{B}^*_{\Gamma}$ and
$\mathcal{X}^*_\Gamma$ are not isomorphic.

between the crystalline and amorphous regimes at {\alpha} ~ 0.3, which can be
identified by a turnover of the temperature dependence in thermal conductivity,
and explained by the dominance of thermal hopping processes. The determination
of this critical disorder level is also validated by the analysis of the
participation ratio of localized vibrational modes, and the spatial
localization of heat flux. These factors can serve as key indicators in
characterizing the transition in heat transport mechanisms.

judgments of state-of-the-art MT systems outputs. This makes trainable metrics
biases in many ways. One of them is preferring longer translations. These
biased metrics when used for tuning are evaluating different types of
translations -- n-best lists of translations with very diverse quality. Systems
tuned with these metrics tend to produce overly long translations that are
preferred by the metric but not by humans. This is usually solved by manually
tweaking metric's weights to equally value recall and precision. Our solution
is more general: (1) it does not address only the recall bias but also all
other biases that might be present in the data and (2) it does not require any
knowledge of the types of features used which is useful in cases when manual
tuning of metric's weights is not possible. This is accomplished by
self-training on unlabeled n-best lists by using metric that was initially
trained on standard human judgments. One way of looking at this is as domain
adaptation from the domain of state-of-the-art MT translations to diverse
n-best list translations.

formation in the range of 10^{10} -- 10^{12} Lsun. We find that: 1.) the
specific star formation rates in the host galaxies are generally consistent
with those of normal star-forming (main sequence) galaxies; 2.) there is a
strong correlation between the luminosities from star formation and the AGN;
and 3.) however, the correlation may not result from a causal connection, but
could arise because the black hole mass (and hence AGN Eddington luminosity)
and star formation are both correlated with the galaxy mass.

different times, have to meet at the same node. This problem is known as
$\mathit{rendezvous}$. Agents move in synchronous rounds. Each agent has a
distinct integer label from the set $\{1,\dots,L\}$. Two main efficiency
measures of rendezvous are its $\mathit{time}$ (the number of rounds until the
meeting) and its $\mathit{cost}$ (the total number of edge traversals). We
investigate tradeoffs between these two measures. A natural benchmark for both
time and cost of rendezvous in a network is the number of edge traversals
needed for visiting all nodes of the network, called the exploration time.
Hence we express the time and cost of rendezvous as functions of an upper bound
$E$ on the time of exploration (where $E$ and a corresponding exploration
procedure are known to both agents) and of the size $L$ of the label space. We
present two natural rendezvous algorithms. Algorithm $\mathtt{Cheap}$ has cost
$O(E)$ (and, in fact, a version of this algorithm for the model where the
agents start simultaneously has cost exactly $E$) and time $O(EL)$. Algorithm
$\mathtt{Fast}$ has both time and cost $O(E\log L)$. Our main contributions are
lower bounds showing that, perhaps surprisingly, these two algorithms capture
the tradeoffs between time and cost of rendezvous almost tightly. We show that
any deterministic rendezvous algorithm of cost asymptotically $E$ (i.e., of
cost $E+o(E)$) must have time $\Omega(EL)$. On the other hand, we show that any
deterministic rendezvous algorithm with time complexity $O(E\log L)$ must have
cost $\Omega (E\log L)$.

autoregression, the Bayesian information criterion is known to be consistent,
and so is the new criterion. When the true order is infinity or suitably high
with respect to the sample size, the Akaike information criterion is known to
be efficient in the sense that its prediction performance is asymptotically
equivalent to the best offered by the candidate models; in this case, the new
criterion behaves in a similar manner. Different from the two classical
criteria, the proposed criterion adaptively achieves either consistency or
efficiency depending on the underlying true model. In practice where the
observed time series is given without any prior information about the model
specification, the proposed order selection criterion is more flexible and
robust compared with classical approaches. Numerical results are presented
demonstrating the adaptivity of the proposed technique when applied to various

sites is coupled to a particular vibrational mode which is taken to be either
harmonic or anharmonic- a truncated (two-state) spectrum. Considering these
models we derive the cumulant generating function in steady state for charge
and energy transfer, correct to second-order in the electron-phonon
interaction, but exact to all orders in the metal-molecule coupling strength.
This is achieved by using the non-equilibrium Green's function approach
(harmonic mode) and a kinetic quantum master equation method (anharmonic mode).
From the cumulant generating function we calculate the charge current and its
noise and the large deviation function for the thermoelectric efficiency. We
demonstrate that at large bias the charge current, differential conductance,
and the current noise can identify energetic and structural properties of the
junction. We further examine the operation of the junction as a thermoelectric
engine and show that while the macroscopic thermoelectric efficiency is
indifferent to the nature of the mode (harmonic or anharmonic), efficiency
fluctuations do reflect this property.

transformation in this approach. This leads to a proof of the equality of
renormalized masses of bosons and fermions and identities relating fermionic
amplitudes to bosonic amplitudes after taking into account the effect of mass
renormalization. This also relates unbroken supersymmetry to a given order in
perturbation theory to absence of tadpoles of massless scalars to higher order.
The results are valid at the perturbative vacuum as well as in the shifted
vacuum when the latter describes the correct ground state of the theory. We
apply this to SO(32) heterotic string theory on Calabi-Yau 3-folds where a one
loop Fayet-Iliopoulos term apparently breaks supersymmetry at one loop, but
analysis of the low energy effective field theory indicates that there is a
nearby vacuum where supersymmetry is restored. We explicitly prove that the
perturbative amplitudes of this theory around the shifted vacuum indeed satisfy
the Ward identities associated with unbroken supersymmetry. We also test the
general arguments by explicitly verifying the equality of bosonic and fermionic
masses at one loop order in the shifted vacuum, and the appearance of two loop

quadratic perturbations in the system Hamiltonian. A small gain approach is
used to evaluate the performance of the given quantum system. In order to get
improved control performance, we propose two methods to design a coherent
controller for the system. One is to formulate a static quantum controller by
adding a controller Hamiltonian to the given system, and the other is to build
a dynamic quantum controller which is directly coupled to the given system.
Both controller design methods are given in terms of LMIs and a non-convex
equality. Hence, a rank constrained LMI method is used as a numerical
procedure. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the proposed methods
and also to make a performance comparison with different controller design
methods. Results show that for the same uncertain quantum system, the dynamic
quantum controller can offer an improvement in performance over the static
quantum controller.

  arXiv:1503.07258",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vertical stabilizer is the key aerodynamic surface that provides an

rudder are the primary control surfaces that give pilots control authority of
the yawing and banking maneuvers. Losing the vertical stabilizer will,
therefore, result in the consequential loss of lateral/directional stability
and control, which is likely to cause a fatal crash. In this paper, we
construct a scenario of a damaged aircraft model which has no physical rudder
control surface, and then a strategy based on differential thrust is proposed
to be utilized as a control input to act as a ""virtual"" rudder to help maintain
stability and control of the damaged aircraft. The $H_{\infty}$ loop-shaping
approach based robust control system design is implemented to achieve a stable
and robust flight envelope, which is aimed to provide a safe landing.
Investigation results demonstrate successful application of such robust
differential thrust methodology as the damaged aircraft can achieve stability
within feasible control limits. Finally, the robustness analysis results
conclude that the stability and performance of the damaged aircraft in the
presence of uncertainty remain within desirable limits, and demonstrate not
only a robust, but a safe flight mission through the proposed $H_{\infty}$
loop-shaping robust differential thrust control methodology.

into the medium hit the receptors after a random delay. Coding over the
diffusion channel is performed by choosing the type, intensity, or the released
time of molecules diffused in the environment over time. To avoid intersymbol
interference (ISI), molecules of the same type should be released at time
instances that are sufficiently far apart. This ensures that molecules of a
previous transmission are faded in the environment, before molecules of the
same type are reused for signaling. In this paper, we consider ISI-free
time-slotted modulation schemes. The maximum reliable transmission rate for
these modulations is given by the constrained coding capacity of the graph that
represents the permissible transmission sequences. However, achieving the
constrained coding capacity requires long blocklengths and delays at the
decoder, making it impractical for simple nanomachines. The main contribution
of this paper is to consider modulations with small delay (short blocklength)
and show that they get very close to constrained coding capacity.

of representations extracted from Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) is quickly
gaining ground on Fisher Vectors (FVs) as favoured state-of-the-art global
image descriptors for image instance retrieval. While the good performance of
CNNs for image classification are unambiguously recognised, which of the two
has the upper hand in the image retrieval context is not entirely clear yet. In
this work, we propose a comprehensive study that systematically evaluates FVs
and CNNs for image retrieval. The first part compares the performances of FVs
and CNNs on multiple publicly available data sets. We investigate a number of
details specific to each method. For FVs, we compare sparse descriptors based
on interest point detectors with dense single-scale and multi-scale variants.
For CNNs, we focus on understanding the impact of depth, architecture and
training data on retrieval results. Our study shows that no descriptor is
systematically better than the other and that performance gains can usually be
obtained by using both types together. The second part of the study focuses on
the impact of geometrical transformations such as rotations and scale changes.
FVs based on interest point detectors are intrinsically resilient to such
transformations while CNNs do not have a built-in mechanism to ensure such
invariance. We show that performance of CNNs can quickly degrade in presence of
rotations while they are far less affected by changes in scale. We then propose
a number of ways to incorporate the required invariances in the CNN pipeline.
Overall, our work is intended as a reference guide offering practically useful
and simply implementable guidelines to anyone looking for state-of-the-art
global descriptors best suited to their specific image instance retrieval
problem.

and computer simulations. In this paper, we use an existing mathematical model
to predict and simulate human brain response to the consumption of a single
dose of methamphetamine. The model is implemented and coded in Matlab. Three
types of personalities including introverts, ambiverts and extroverts are
studied. The parameters of the mathematical model are calibrated and optimized,
according to psychological theories, using a real coded genetic algorithm. The
simulations show significant correlation between people response to
methamphetamine abuse and their personality. They also show that one of the
causes of tendency to stimulants roots in consumers personality traits. The
results can be used as a tool for reducing attitude towards addiction.

important objectives of biotechnology. Computational simulation is an
established methodology for the design and optimization of bioprocesses, where
the finite elements method (FEM) is at the state-of-art engineering
multi-physics simulation system, with tools such as Finite Element Analysis
(FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Although FEA and CFD are
currently applied to bioreactor design, most simulations are restricted to the
multi-physics capabilities of the existing sofware packages. This manuscript is
a contribution for the consolidation of FEM in computational biotechnology, by
presenting a comprehensive review of finite element procedures of the most
common enzymatic mechanisms found in biotechnological processes, such as,
enzyme activation, Michaelis Menten, competitive inhibition, non-competitive
inhibition, anti-competitive inhibition, competition by substrate, sequential
random mechanism, ping-pong bi-bi and Theorel-Chance. Most importantly, the
manuscript opens the possibility for the use of FEM in conjunction with
{\guillemotleft}in-silico{\guillemotright} models of metabolic networks, as
well as, chemical networks in order to simulate complex bioprocesses in
biotechnology, putting emphasis into flux balance analysis, pheno-metabolomics
space exploration in time and space, overcoming the limitations of assuming
chemostat conditions in systems biology computations.

feature of this gravitational theory is that the divergence of the

the model in terms of an equivalent scalar-tensor theory, with two arbitrary
potentials. By using the formalism of open thermodynamic systems, we interpret
the energy balance equations in this gravitational theory from a thermodynamic
point of view, as describing irreversible matter creation processes. The
particle number creation rates, the creation pressure, and the entropy
production rates are explicitly obtained as functions of the scalar field and
its potentials, as well as of the matter Lagrangian. The temperature evolution
laws of the newly created particles are also obtained. The cosmological
implications of the model are briefly investigated, and it is shown that the
late-time cosmic acceleration may be due to particle creation processes.
Furthermore, it is also shown that due to the curvature--matter coupling,
during the cosmological evolution a large amount of comoving entropy is also
produced.

magnetic field and flowing current in case of not only normal state but also
quench state [3]. In case of quench on hexapole coils, unbalanced flowing
current among the hexapole coils is generated and it causes unbalanced

than those in normal state due to unbalanced electromagnetic force among

of points along contiguous sections of the curve, and the efficiency of the
R-tree depends on the size of the bounding boxes---smaller is better. Since
there are many different ways to generalize the Hilbert curve to higher

smallest bounding boxes. Familiar methods, such as the one by Butz, can result
in curve sections whose bounding boxes are a factor $\Omega(2^{d/2})$ larger

bounded by such bounding boxes would not contain any data points. In this paper
we present a new way of generalizing Hilbert's curve to higher dimensions,

measures from how many states the state of interest can be obtained via LOCC,
the accessible entanglement measures how many states can be reached via LOCC

driving continuum variations in the best-studied AGN NGC 5548. For a particular
choice of BLR geometry, Hb surface emissivity based on photoionization models,
and using a scaled version of the 13 yr optical continuum light curve as a
proxy for the driving ionizing continuum, we explore several key factors that
determine the broad emission line luminosity L, characteristic size R(RW), and
variability amplitude (i.e., responsivity) eta, as well as the interplay
between them.
  For fixed boundary models which extend as far as the hot-dust the predicted
delays for Hb are on average too long. However, the predicted variability
amplitude of Hb provides a remarkably good match to observations except during
low continuum states. We suggest that the continuum flux variations which drive
the redistribution in Hb surface emissivity F(r) do not on their own lead to
large enough changes in R(RW) or eta(eff). We thus investigate dust-bounded
BLRs for which the location of the effective outer boundary is modulated by the
continuum level and the dust-sublimation and dust-condensation timescales. We
find that in order to match the observed variability amplitude of broad Hb in
NGC 5548 a rather static outer boundary is preferred.
  Intriguingly, we show that the most effective way of reducing the Hb delay,
while preserving its responsivity and equivalent width, is to invoke a smaller
value in the incident ionizing photon flux Phi(H) for a given ionizing
source--cloud radial distance r, than is normally inferred from the observed UV
continuum flux and typical models of the continuum SED.

surface isomorphically represents $\mathbb H$ with a kinematic subspace
$\mathbb V \subset\mathbb K$. The isomorphism induces the complete sets of
Dirac observables in $\mathbb D$, which faithfully represent the corresponding
complete sets of self-adjoint operators in $\mathbb V$. Due to the constraints,
a specific subset of the observables would be ""frozen"" as number operators,
providing a background physical time for the rest of the observables.
Therefore, a proper foliation with the quantum Cauchy surfaces may provide an
observer frame describing the physical states of spacetimes in a Schr\""odinger
picture, with the evolutions under a specific physical background. A simple
model will be supplied as an initiative trial.

non-zero temperature behavior of a two-dimensional (2D) Fermi gas. We include a
generic combination of Rashba and Dresselhaus terms into the system
Hamiltonian, which allows us to study both the experimentally relevant
equal-Rashba-Dresselhaus (ERD) limit and the Rashba-only (RO) limit. At zero
temperature, we derive the phase diagram as a function of the two-body binding
energy and Zeeman field. In the ERD case, this phase diagram reveals several
topologically distinct uniform superfluid phases, classified according to the
nodal structure of the quasiparticle excitation energies. Furthermore, we use a
momentum dependent SU(2)-rotation to transform the system into a generalized
helicity basis, revealing that spin-orbit coupling induces a triplet pairing
component of the order parameter. At non-zero temperature, we study the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition by including phase
fluctuations of the order parameter up to second order. We show that the
superfluid density becomes anisotropic due to the presence of spin-orbit
coupling (except in the RO case). This leads both to elliptic vortices and
antivortices, and to anisotropic sound velocities. The latter prove to be
sensitive to quantum phase transitions between topologically distinct phases.
We show further that at a fixed non-zero Zeeman field, the BKT critical
temperature is increased by the presence of ERD spin-orbit coupling.
Subsequently, we demonstrate that the Clogston limit becomes infinite:
$T_{\rm{BKT}}$ remains non-zero at all finite values of the Zeeman field. We

mainly of sporadic uplink transmissions. In such a setting, the amount of

assigning more random access opportunities may actually worsen performance; and
2) the additional signaling that follows the ARP has very large impact on the

using the Stokes drag force, but without taking into account contributions from

contributions influence, under a variety of hydrodynamic conditions, the force
at the anchor point of a tethered cell and the survival probability of a
bacterium that is attached to a host by either a slip or a catch bond via a
tether with a few different biomechanical properties. We show that a
consequence of not including some of these contributions is that the force to
which a bond is exposed can be significantly underestimated; in general by
~32-46 %, where the influence of the surface corrections dominate (the parallel
and normal correction coefficients contribute with ~5-8 or 23-26 %,
respectively). The Basset force is a major contributor, up to 20 %, for larger
cells and shear rates. The lift force and inertia contribute when cells with
radii >3 micrometer reside in shear rates >2000 1/s. Buoyancy contributes
significantly for cells with radii >3 micrometer in shear rates <10 1/s. Since
the lifetime of a bond depends strongly on the force, both the level of
approximations and the biomechanical model of the tether significantly affect
the survival probability of tethered bacteria. For a cell attached with a
FimH-mannose bond and an extendable tether in a shear rate of 3000 1/s,
neglecting the surface correction coefficients or the Basset force can imply
that the survival probability is overestimated by more than an order of
magnitude. This work thus shows that in order to quantitatively assess
bacterial attachment forces and survival probabilities, both the fluid forces

coils, the optimization of the transmit signals can dramatically improve the
power efficiency. In this work, we propose an iterative algorithm for the
optimization of the transmit signals for a transmitter with three orthogonal
coils and multiple single coil receivers. The proposed scheme significantly
outperforms the traditional baseline algorithms in terms of power efficiency.

forty years, remains elusive and undetected. It also suffers, in its original
context of gravitational black holes, from practical and conceptual
difficulties. Of particular note is the trans-Planckian problem, which is
concerned with the apparent origin of the radiation in absurdly high
frequencies. In order to gain better theoretical understanding and, it is
hoped, experimental verification of Hawking radiation, much study is being
devoted to laboratory systems which use moving media to model the spacetime
geometry of black holes, and which, by analogy, are also thought to emit
Hawking radiation. These analogue systems typically exhibit dispersion, which
regularizes the wave behaviour at the horizon at the cost of a more complicated
theoretical framework. This tutorial serves as an introduction to Hawking
radiation and its analogues, developing the moving medium analogy for black
holes and demonstrating how dispersion can be incorporated into this

accretion disc around a spinning black hole. During accretion, rotating matter
experiences centrifugal pressure supported shock transition that effectively
produces a virtual barrier around the black hole in the form of post-shock
corona (hereafter, PSC). Due to shock compression, PSC becomes hot and dense
that eventually deflects a part of the inflowing matter as bipolar outflows
because of the presence of extra thermal gradient force. In our approach, we
study the outflow properties in terms of the inflow parameters, namely specific
energy (${\mathcal E}$) and specific angular momentum ($\lambda$) considering
the realistic outflow geometry around the rotating black holes. We find that
spin of the black hole ($a_k$) plays an important role in deciding the outflow
rate $R_{\dot m}$ (ratio of mass flux of outflow and inflow), in particular,
$R_{\dot m}$ is directly correlated with $a_k$ for the same set of inflow
parameters. It is found that a large range of the inflow parameters allows
global accretion-ejection solutions and the effective area of the parameter
space (${\mathcal E}$, $\lambda$) with and without outflow decreases with black
hole spin ($a_k$). We compute the maximum outflow rate ($R^{max}_{\dot m}$) as
function of black hole spin ($a_k$) and observe that $R^{max}_{\dot m}$ weakly
depends on $a_k$ that lies in the range $\sim 10\%-18\%$ of the inflow rate for
the adiabatic index $(\gamma)$ with $1.5 \ge \gamma \ge 4/3$. We present the
observational implication of our approach while studying the steady/persistent
Jet activities based on the accretion states of black holes. We discuss that
our formalism seems to have the potential to explain the observed Jet kinetic

13224-3809. We considered all five archival XMM-Newton observations, and we
applied the 'flux-flux plot' (FFP) method. We found that the flux-flux plots
were highly affected by the choice of the light curves' time bin size, most
probably because of the fast and large amplitude variations, and the intrinsic
non-linear flux--flux relations in this source. Therefore, we recommend that
the smallest bin-size should be used in such cases. Hence, We constructed FFPs
in 11 energy bands below 1.7 keV, and we considered the 1.7-3 keV band, as
being representative of the primary emission. The FFPs are reasonably well
fitted by a 'power-law plus a constant' model. We detected significant positive
constants in three out of five observations. The best-fit slopes are flatter
than unity at energies below $\sim 0.9$ keV, where the soft excess is
strongest. This suggests the presence of intrinsic spectral variability. A
power-law-like primary component, which is variable in flux and spectral slope
(as $\Gamma\propto N_{\rm PL}^{0.1}$) and a soft-excess component, which varies
with the primary continuum (as $F_{\rm excess}\propto F_{\rm primary}^{0.46}$),
can broadly explain the FFPs. In fact, this can create positive `constants',
even when a stable spectral component does not exist. Nevertheless, the
possibility of a stable, soft--band constant component cannot be ruled out, but
its contribution to the observed 0.2-1 keV band flux should be less than $\sim
15$ %. The model constants in the FFPs were consistent with zero in one
observation, and negative at energies below 1 keV in another. It is hard to
explain these results in the context of any spectral variability scenario, but
they may signify the presence of a variable, warm absorber in the source.

require machines to recognize and understand queries and their semantics, as in
search or question answering systems. Latent variable models have increasingly
gained attention for the statistical modeling of knowledge graphs, showing
promising results in tasks related to knowledge graph completion and cleaning.
Besides storing facts about the world, schema-based knowledge graphs are backed
by rich semantic descriptions of entities and relation-types that allow
machines to understand the notion of things and their semantic relationships.
In this work, we study how type-constraints can generally support the
statistical modeling with latent variable models. More precisely, we integrated
prior knowledge in form of type-constraints in various state of the art latent
variable approaches. Our experimental results show that prior knowledge on
relation-types significantly improves these models up to 77% in link-prediction
tasks. The achieved improvements are especially prominent when a low model
complexity is enforced, a crucial requirement when these models are applied to
very large datasets. Unfortunately, type-constraints are neither always
available nor always complete e.g., they can become fuzzy when entities lack
proper typing. We show that in these cases, it can be beneficial to apply a
local closed-world assumption that approximates the semantics of relation-types
based on observations made in the data.

represent contemporary species (""taxa"") and interior vertices represent extinct
ancestors. Informally, convex characters are measurements on the contemporary
species in which the subset of species (both contemporary and extinct) that
share a given state, form a connected subtree. Given an unrooted, binary
phylogenetic tree T on a set of n >= 2 taxa, a closed (but fairly opaque)
expression for the number of convex characters on T has been known since 1992,
and this is independent of the exact topology of T. In this note we prove that
this number is actually equal to the (2n-1)th Fibonacci number. Next, we define
g_k(T) to be the number of convex characters on T in which each state appears
on at least k taxa. We show that, somewhat curiously, g_2(T) is also
independent of the topology of T, and is equal to to the (n-1)th Fibonacci
number. As we demonstrate, this topological neutrality subsequently breaks down
for k >= 3. However, we show that for each fixed k >= 1, g_k(T) can be computed
in O(n) time and the set of characters thus counted can be efficiently listed
and sampled. We use these insights to give a simple but effective exact
algorithm for the NP-hard maximum parsimony distance problem that runs in time
$\Theta( \phi^{n} \cdot n^2 )$, where $\phi \approx 1.618...$ is the golden
ratio, and an exact algorithm which computes the tree bisection and
reconnection distance (equivalently, a maximum agreement forest) in time
$\Theta( \phi^{2n}\cdot \text{poly}(n))$, where $\phi^2 \approx 2.619$.

effort to handle fine grids to resolve the geometries as well as sophisticated
tissue models is very challenging. One possibility to derive a strongly
scalable parallel solution algorithm is to consider finite element tearing and
interconnecting (FETI) methods. In this study we propose and investigate the
application of FETI methods to simulate the elastic behavior of biological soft
tissues. As one particular example we choose the artery which is - as most
other biological tissues - characterized by anisotropic and nonlinear material
properties. We compare two specific approaches of FETI methods, classical and
all-floating, and investigate the numerical behavior of different
preconditioning techniques. In comparison to classical FETI, the all-floating
approach has not only advantages concerning the implementation but in many
cases also concerning the convergence of the global iterative solution method.
This behavior is illustrated with numerical examples. We present results of
linear elastic simulations to show convergence rates, as expected from the
theory, and results from the more sophisticated nonlinear case where we apply a
well-known anisotropic model to the realistic geometry of an artery. Although
the FETI methods have a great applicability on artery simulations we will also
discuss some limitations concerning the dependence on material parameters.

spectral and polarization data revealed the frequency dependence of the degree
of circular polarization and the delay between two polarized components for the
first time. The degree of circular polarization was 50-70 percent right-handed
and it varied little as a function of frequency. Cross-correlation analysis
determined that the left-handed circularly polarized component was delayed by
50-70 ms relative to the right-handed component over the entire frequency range
of the ZP and this delay increased with the frequency. We examined the obtained
polarization characteristics by using pre-existing ZP models and concluded that
the ZP was generated by the double plasma resonance process. Our results
suggest that the ZP emission was originally generated in a completely polarized
state in the O-mode and was partly converted into the X-mode near the source.
Subsequently, the difference between the group velocities of the O-mode and

temperature theories. Here the RGOPT adapted to finite temperature is
illustrated with a detailed evaluation of the two-loop pressure for the thermal
scalar $ \lambda\phi^4$ field theory. We show that already at the simple
one-loop level this quantity is exactly scale-invariant by construction and
turns out to qualitatively reproduce, with a rather simple procedure, results
from more sophisticated resummation methods at two-loop order, such as the
two-particle irreducible approach typically. This lowest order also reproduces
the exact large-$N$ results of the $O(N)$ model. Although very close in spirit,
our RGOPT method and corresponding results differ drastically from similar
variational approaches, such as the screened perturbation theory or its
QCD-version, the (resummed) hard thermal loop perturbation theory. The latter
approaches exhibit a sensibly degrading scale dependence at higher orders,
which we identify as a consequence of missing RG invariance. In contrast RGOPT
gives a considerably reduced scale dependence at two-loop level, even for
relatively large coupling values $\sqrt{\lambda/24}\sim {\cal O}(1)$, making
results much more stable as compared with standard perturbation theory, with
expected similar properties for thermal QCD.

ground for such studies, as they are nonlinear solutions that would be expected
to reflect the background geometry. In particular, we assess the role of black
hole quasinormal modes in gravitational experiments devised to be sensitive to
the existence of the brane, in a lower-dimensional setting where we have
analytical control. We compute quasinormal modes of brane-localized black holes

charged particles are discussed. We consider a very transparent example of an
ideal pion gas with quantum statistics, which can be viewed as a
multi-component gas of Boltzmann particles with different charges and masses.
Cumulants of net-electric charge fluctuations $\chi_n^Q$ are calculated in a
static and expanding medium with flow parameters adjusted to the experimental
data. We show that the transverse momentum cut, $p_{t_\text{min}}\leq p_t\leq
p_{t_\text{max}}$, weakens the effects of Bose statistics, i.e. contributions
of effectively multi-charged states to higher order moments. Consequently, cuts
in $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We
discuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of
electric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent
data of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We find that the different momentum
cuts of $p_{t_\text{min}}=0.2$~GeV (STAR) and $p_{t_\text{min}}=0.3$~GeV
(PHENIX) are responsible for more than 30\% of the difference between these two
data sets. We argue that the $p_t$ cuts imposed on charged particles will
influence the normalized kurtosis {$\kappa_Q\sigma_Q^2 = \chi_4^Q/\chi_2^Q$} of
the electric charge fluctuations. In particular, the reduction of
$\kappa_Q\sigma_Q^2$ with increasing $p_{t_\text{min}}$ will lead to
differences between PHENIX and STAR data of ${\cal O}(6\%)$ which currently are
buried under large statistical and systematic errors. We furthermore introduce
the relation between momentum cut-off and finite volume effects, which is of

correlation to this $\hat{G}$ sample (Griffith et al. 2015). I demonstrate that
the mid-IR and radio luminosities are correlated for the sample with
$q_{22}=1.35\pm0.42 $. By comparison, the First Look Survey (FLS) has
$q_{22}=0.87\pm0.27$. The fact that the G-HAT sample largely follows the Mid-IR
radio correlation, strongly suggests the vast majority of these sources are
associated with galaxies in which natural astrophysical processes are dominant.
This simple application of the mid-IR radio correlation can substantially
reduce the number of false positives in the $\hat{G}$ catalogue, since galaxies
occupied by advanced Kardashev Type III civilisations would be expected to
exhibit very high values of $q$. Indeed I identify 9 outliers in the sample
with $q_{22} > 2$ of which at least 3 have properties that are relatively well
explained via standard astrophysical interpretations e.g. dust emission
associated with nascent star formation and/or nuclear activity from a heavily
obscured AGN. I also note that the comparison of resolved Mid-IR and radio
images of galaxies on sub-galactic (kpc) scales can also be useful in
identifying and recognising artificial mid-IR emission from less advanced
intermediate Type II/III civilisations. Nevertheless, from the bulk properties
of the $\hat{G}$ sample, I conclude that Kardashev Type-III civilisations are
either very rare or do not exist in the local Universe.

rearrange internally while still providing Stokes-Einstein-like diffusion of

we provide a complete solution by extending results for $s=0=\tilde s$ by do
Carmo and Dajczer and by Dajczer and the second author. Our main results are
for the most interesting case $n=3$, and these are new even in the Riemannian
case $s=0=\tilde s$. In particular, we characterize the solutions that have
dimension $n=3$ and three distinct principal curvatures. We show that these are
closely related to conformally flat hypersurfaces of $\mathbb{Q}_s^{4}(c)$ with
three distinct principal curvatures, and we obtain a similar characterization
of the latter that improves a theorem by Hertrich-Jeromin. We also derive a
Ribaucour transformation for both classes of hypersurfaces, which gives a
process to produce a family of new elements of those classes, starting from a
given one, in terms of solutions of a linear system of PDE's. This enables us
to construct explicit examples of three-dimensional solutions of the problem,
as well as new explicit examples of three-dimensional conformally flat
hypersurfaces that have three distinct principal curvatures.

updating process is defined by a sequence of non-negative random vectors
$\{(D_{1,n}, D_{2,n});n\geq1\}$ and randomly evolving thresholds which utilize
accruing statistical information for the updates. Let $m_1=E[D_{1,n}]$ and
$m_2=E[D_{2,n}]$. Motivated by applications, in this paper we undertake a
detailed study of the dynamics of the ARRU model. First, for the case $m_1 \neq
m_2$, we establish $L_1$ bounds on the increments of the urn proportion at
fixed and increasing times under very weak assumptions on the random threshold
sequence. As a consequence, we deduce weak consistency of the evolving urn
proportions. Second, under slightly stronger conditions, we establish the
strong consistency of the urn proportions for all finite values of $m_1$ and
$m_2$. Specifically, we show that when $m_1=m_2$ the proportion converges to a
non-degenerate random variable. Third, we establish the asymptotic
distribution, after appropriate centering and scaling, of the proportion of
sampled balls in the case $m_1=m_2$. In the process, we settle the issue of
asymptotic distribution of the number of sampled balls for a randomly
reinforced urn (RRU). To address the technical issues, we establish results on
the harmonic moments of the total number of balls in the urn at different times
under very weak conditions, which is of independent interest.

studies of exoplanet transits--especially transmission spectroscopy, where the
transit modelling is carried out for custom narrow passbands--eclipsing
binaries (EBs), interferometry, and microlensing events. First, LDTk can be
used to compute custom limb darkening profiles with uncertainties propagated

directly integrated into the log posterior computation of any pre-existing
modelling code with minimal modifications. The last approach can be used to
constrain the LD model parameter space directly by the LD profile, allowing for
the marginalization over the LD parameter space without the need to approximate
the constraint from the LD profile using a prior.

role in fields like optical sensing, cavity quantum electrodynamics and cavity

to the polarizability of the perturbation. Here we demonstrate that particles
perturbing a radiating cavity can induce strong frequency shifts that are
opposite to, and even exceed, the effects based on the particles'
polarizability. A full electrodynamic theory reveals that these anomalous
results rely on a non-trivial phase relation between cavity and nanoparticle
radiation, allowing back-action via the radiation continuum. In addition, an
intuitive model based on coupled mode theory is presented that relates the
phenomenon to retardation. Because of the ubiquity of dissipation, we expect
