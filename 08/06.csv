numbers. For example the transmission of numerical clock readings is implicit
in the concept of a coordinate system. The transmission of numbers and other
logical distinctions is often achieved over a computer-mediated communications
network in the face of an unpredictable environment. By unpredictable we mean
something stronger than the spread of probabilities over given possible
outcomes, namely an opening to unforeseeable possibilities. Unpredictability,
until now overlooked in theoretical physics, makes the transmission of numbers
interesting. Based on recent proofs within quantum theory that provide a
theoretical foundation to unpredictability, here we show how regularities in
physics rest on a background of channels over which numbers are transmitted.
  As is known to engineers of digital communications, numerical transmissions
depend on coordination reminiscent of the cycle of throwing and catching by
players tossing a ball back and forth. In digital communications, the players
are computers, and the required coordination involves unpredictably adjusting
""live clocks"" that step these computers through phases of a cycle. We show how
this phasing, which we call `logical synchronization,' constrains
number-carrying networks, and, if a spacetime manifold in invoked, put
""stripes"" on spacetime. Via its logically synchronized channels, a network of
live clocks serves as a reference against which to locate events. Such a
network in any case underpins a coordinate frame, and in some cases the direct
use of a network can be tailored to investigate an unpredictable environment.
Examples include explorations of gravitational variations near Earth.

First, the cosmological constant only curves the compact bulk geometry into a

term is introduced in order to circumvent Weinberg's fine-tuning argument,
which otherwise enters here through a backdoor via the flux quantization
condition. In this paper, we show that the latter mechanism does not work in

flat on-brane geometry is one which preserves the scale invariance of the bulk
theory. Consequently, Weinberg's argument applies, making a fine-tuning
necessary again. The only remaining window of opportunity lies within scale
invariance breaking brane couplings, for which the tuning could be avoided.
Whether the corresponding 4D curvature could be kept under control and in
agreement with the observed value will be answered in our companion paper

quasi-optimal interpolation of multidimensional analytic functions defined over
a product of one dimensional bounded domains. The goal of such approach is to
construct an interpolant in space that corresponds to the ""best $M$-terms""
based on sharp a priori estimate of polynomial coefficients. In the past, SG
methods have been successful in achieving this, with a traditional construction
that relies on the solution to a Knapsack problem: only the most profitable
hierarchical surpluses are added to the SG. However, this approach requires
additional sharp estimates related to the size of the analytic region and the
norm of the interpolation operator, i.e., the Lebesgue constant. Instead, we
present an iterative SG procedure that adaptively refines an estimate of the
region and accounts for the effects of the Lebesgue constant. Our approach does
not require any a priori knowledge of the analyticity or operator norm, is
easily generalized to both affine and non-affine analytic functions, and can be
applied to sparse grids build from one dimensional rules with arbitrary growth
of the number of nodes. In several numerical examples, we utilize our
dynamically adaptive SG to interpolate quantities of interest related to the
solutions of parametrized elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs, and compare the
performance of our quasi-optimal interpolant to several alternative SG schemes.

formed using an ensemble of particles. A stratified sample is taken from this
distribution and weighted under the posterior, a state-of-the-art ensemble
transport resampling method is then used to create an evenly weighted sample
ready for the next iteration. We demonstrate that this ensemble transport
adaptive importance sampling (ETAIS) method outperforms MCMC methods with
equivalent proposal distributions for low dimensional problems, and in fact
shows better than linear improvements in convergence rates with respect to the
number of ensemble members. We also introduce a new resampling strategy,
multinomial transformation (MT), which while not as accurate as the ensemble
transport resampler, is substantially less costly for large ensemble sizes, and
can then be used in conjunction with ETAIS for complex problems. We also focus
on how algorithmic parameters regarding the mixture proposal can be quickly
tuned to optimise performance. In particular, we demonstrate this methodology's
superior sampling for multimodal problems, such as those arising from inference
for mixture models, and for problems with expensive likelihoods requiring the
solution of a differential equation, for which speed-ups of orders of magnitude
are demonstrated. Likelihood evaluations of the ensemble could be computed in a

probability distributions defined on a finite interval $[a,b] \in \mathbb{R}$,
it is the uniform probability distribution that minimizes the path length of
the associated cumulative distribution function $F_{\mathcal{P}}$ on $[a,b]$.
This intuition is extended to situations where there are constraints on the
allowable probability distributions. In particular, constraints on the first
and second raw moments of a distribution are discussed in detail, including the
analytical form of the solutions and numerical studies of particular examples.
The resulting ""shortest path"" distributions are found to be decidedly more
heavy-tailed than the associated maximum-entropy distributions, suggesting that
entropy and ""CDF path length"" measure two different aspects of uncertainty for
bounded distributions.

electrical resistance should be less than 30% of the total leg resistance for
zero thermal contact resistance, while the thermal contact resistance should be

averaging despite its quantum nature. We refer to this phenomenon as the
quantum resonant inverse Faraday effect. For weak electromagnetic field, when
the characteristic coupling energy is small compared to the energy level
spacing, we predict narrow resonances in the circulating current and,
consequently, in the magnetic moment of the ring. For strong fields, the
resonances merge into a wide peak with a width determined by the spectral
curvature. We further demonstrate that weak short-range disorder splits the
resonances and induces additional particularly sharp and high resonant peaks in
dc current and magnetization. In contrast, long-range disorder leads to a
chaotic behavior of the system in the vicinity of the separatrix that divides
the phase space of the system into regions with dynamically localized and
delocalized states.

sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, or active galactic
nuclei are promising candidates. Multi-messenger programs offer a unique
opportunity to detect these transient sources. By combining the information

observatories, the probability of detecting a source is enhanced, allowing the
possibility of identifying a neutrino progenitor from a single detected event.
A method based on optical and X-ray follow-ups of high-energy neutrino alerts
has been developed within the ANTARES collaboration. This program, denoted as
TAToO, triggers a network of robotic optical telescopes (TAROT and ROTSE) and
the Swift-XRT with a delay of only a few seconds after a neutrino detection,
and is therefore well-suited to search for fast transient sources. To identify
an optical or X-ray counterpart to a neutrino signal, the images provided by
the follow-up observations are analysed with dedicated pipelines. A total of 42
alerts with optical and 7 alerts with X-ray images taken with a maximum delay

counterparts associated to the neutrino triggers have been found, and upper
limits on transient source magnitudes have been derived. The probability to
reject the gamma-ray burst origin hypothesis has been computed for each alert.

observation of the local Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365. The source, well known for
its dramatic X-ray spectral variability, was caught in a reflection-dominated,
Compton-thick state. The high spatial resolution afforded by Chandra allowed us
to isolate the soft X-ray emission from the active nucleus, neglecting most of
the contribution from the kpc-scale starburst ring. The HETG spectra thus
revealed a wealth of He- and H-like lines from photoionized gas, whereas in
larger aperture observations these are almost exclusively produced through
collisional ionization in the circumnuclear environment. Once the residual
thermal component is accounted for, the emission-line properties of the
photoionized region close to the hard X-ray continuum source indicate that NGC
1365 has some similarities to the local population of obscured active galaxies.
In spite of the limited overall data quality, several soft X-ray lines seem to
have fairly broad profiles (~800-1300 km/s full-width at half maximum), and a
range of outflow velocities (up to ~1600 km/s, but possibly reaching a few
thousands km/s) appears to be involved. At higher energies, the K$\alpha$
fluorescence line from neutral iron is resolved with > 99 per cent confidence,
and its width of ~3000 km/s points to an origin from the same broad-line region

luminosity function (LF) across cosmic time where star formation is linked to
the assembly of dark matter halos under the assumption of a mass dependent, but
redshift independent, efficiency. We introduce a new self-consistent treatment
of the halo star formation history, which allows us to make predictions at
$z>10$ (lookback time $\lesssim500$ Myr), when growth is rapid. With a
calibration at a single redshift to set the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and no
further degrees of freedom, our model captures the evolution of the UV LF over
all available observations ($0\lesssim z\lesssim10$). The significant drop in
luminosity density of currently detectable galaxies beyond $z\sim8$ is
explained by a shift of star formation toward less massive, fainter galaxies.
Assuming that star formation proceeds down to atomic cooling halos, we derive a
reionization optical depth $\tau = 0.056^{+0.007}_{-0.010}$, fully consistent
with the latest Planck measurement, implying that the universe is fully
reionized at $z=7.84^{+0.65}_{-0.98}$. In addition, our model naturally
produces smoothly rising star formation histories for galaxies with $L\lesssim
L_*$ in agreement with observations and hydrodynamical simulations. Before the
epoch of reionization at $z>10$ we predict the LF to remain well-described by a
Schechter function, but with an increasingly steep faint-end slope
($\alpha\sim-3.5$ at $z\sim16$). Finally, we construct forecasts for surveys
with \JWST~and \WFIRST and predict that galaxies out to $z\sim14$ will be
observed. Galaxies at $z>15$ will likely be accessible to JWST and WFIRST only
through the assistance of strong lensing magnification.

best-fit models, the epoch of resonant particle creation reenters the horizon
at wave numbers of $k_* \sim 0.00011 \pm 0.0004 $ ($h$ Mpc$^{-1}$). The

that such a jump can also resolve the excessively large dark flow predicted

the proposed formulations, we adopted a two-stage approach, including a power
distribution phase among distinct subcarriers, and a power allocation phase

learning because they are more accurate than linear models. Variable selection
for kernel regression models is a challenge partly because, unlike the linear
regression setting, there is no clear concept of an effect size for regression
coefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that provides an
effect size analog of each explanatory variable for Bayesian kernel regression
models when the kernel is shift-invariant --- for example, the Gaussian kernel.
We use function analytic properties of shift-invariant reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to define a linear vector space that: (i) captures
nonlinear structure, and (ii) can be projected onto the original explanatory
variables. The projection onto the original explanatory variables serves as an
analog of effect sizes. The specific function analytic property we use is that
shift-invariant kernel functions can be approximated via random Fourier bases.
Based on the random Fourier expansion we propose a computationally efficient
class of Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR) models for both
nonlinear regression and binary classification for which one can compute an
analog of effect sizes. We illustrate the utility of BAKR by examining two
important problems in statistical genetics: genomic selection (i.e. phenotypic
prediction) and association mapping (i.e. inference of significant variants or
loci). State-of-the-art methods for genomic selection and association mapping
are based on kernel regression and linear models, respectively. BAKR is the
first method that is competitive in both settings.

Martens","The Minimum of Solar Cycle 23: As Deep as It Could Be?",,"The Astrophysical Journal, 804:68 (12pp), 2015 May 1","10.1088/0004-637X/804/1/68",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we introduce a new way of binning sunspot group data with the
purpose of better understanding the impact of the solar cycle on sunspot
properties and how this defined the characteristics of the extended minimum of
cycle 23. Our approach assumes that the statistical properties of sunspots are
completely determined by the strength of the underlying large-scale field and
have no additional time dependencies. We use the amplitude of the cycle at any
given moment (something we refer to as activity level) as a proxy for the
strength of this deep-seated magnetic field.
  We find that the sunspot size distribution is composed of two populations:
one population of groups and active regions and a second population of pores
and ephemeral regions. When fits are performed at periods of different activity
level, only the statistical properties of the former population, the active
regions, is found to vary.
  Finally, we study the relative contribution of each component (small-scale
versus large-scale) to solar magnetism. We find that when hemispheres are
treated separately, almost every one of the past 12 solar minima reaches a
point where the main contribution to magnetism comes from the small-scale
component. However, due to asymmetries in cycle phase, this state is very
rarely reached by both hemispheres at the same time. From this we infer that
even though each hemisphere did reach the magnetic baseline, from a
heliospheric point of view the minimum of cycle 23 was not as deep as it could
have been.

adjusting the tunnel coupling. We find that this method reduces the dephasing

near a charge-state anti-crossing, increasing the number of observable exchange
oscillations in our qubit by a similar factor. Performance also improves with

wettability or temperature. However, the pinning defects on the surface
manifested in terms of a wetting hysteresis, or first-order nonlinear friction,
limit the motion in the sense that a critical size has to be exceeded for a
drop to move. The effect of hysteresis can, however, be mitigated by an
external vibration that can be either structured or stochastic, thereby
creating a directed motion of the drop. Many of the well-known features of
rectification, amplification, and switching that are generic to electronics can
be engineered with such types of movements. A specific case of interest is the
random coalescence of drops on a surface that gives rise to self-generated
noise. This noise overcomes the pinning potential, thereby generating a random
motion of the coalesced drops. Randomly moving coalesced drops themselves
exhibit a directed diffusive flux when a boundary is present to eliminate them
by absorption. With the presence of a bias, the coalesced drops execute a
diffusive drift motion that can have useful applications in various water and
thermal management technologies.

deriving an estimate of the between-study variation, the heterogeneity, and
subsequently using this as the basis for combining results, i.e., for
estimating the effect, the figure of primary interest. The heterogeneity
variance estimate however is commonly associated with substantial uncertainty,
especially in contexts where there are only few studies available, such as in
small populations and rare diseases.
  METHODS: Confidence intervals and tests for the effect may be constructed via
a simple normal approximation, or via a Student-t distribution, using the
Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) approach, which additionally uses a refined
estimator of variance of the effect estimator. The modified Knapp-Hartung
method (mKH) applies an ad hoc correction and has been proposed to prevent
counterintuitive effects and to yield more conservative inference. We performed
a simulation study to investigate the behaviour of the standard HKSJ and
modified mKH procedures in a range of circumstances, with a focus on the common
case of meta-analysis based on only a few studies.
  RESULTS: The standard HKSJ procedure works well when the treatment effect
estimates to be combined are of comparable precision, but nominal error levels
are exceeded when standard errors vary considerably between studies (e.g. due
to variations in study size). Application of the modification on the other hand
yields more conservative results with error rates closer to the nominal level.
Differences are most pronounced in the common case of few studies of varying
size or precision.
  CONCLUSIONS: Use of the modified mKH procedure is recommended, especially
when only a few studies contribute to the meta-analysis and the involved
studies' precisions (standard errors) vary.

several astrophysical discrepancies (cusp-vs-core problem, missing satellite

promising framework for solving all these problems, and self-interaction cross
sections are duly constrained in the literature. Following the work of Tulin,
Yu, and Zurek [1], we can constrain the dark matter mass and the mass of a
light mediator assuming a generic scalar Yukawa-type interaction. In
particular, we constrain the strongly coupled inflationary dark matter of the
luminogenesis model, a unification model with the gauge group $SU(3)_C \times
SU(6) \times U(1)_Y$, which breaks to the Standard Model with an extra gauge
group for dark matter when the inflaton rolls into its true vacuum. The
luminogenesis model is additionally subject to constraints on inflation, and we
find an upper bound on the scale of symmetry breaking of the inflaton and the
decoupling scale $M_1$ of certain representations of the gauge group. We
emphasize that the luminogenesis model enables a unique connection between
astrophysical constraints, the nature of dark matter, and inflation.

The paper demonstrates the formulation on two classes of models: 1) multi-level
directed acyclic graphs, and 2) interdependent coupled networks. For both
models synthetic case studies are used to explore trends. For the first class,
the approach is also applied to the Linux operating system. Results indicate
that desired resilience and robustness levels are achievable by trading off
different design parameters, such as redundancy, node recovery time, and backup

resilience levels confirms the utility of the proposed approach, which is of

is ideal for this study, because M can be many 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals
in an M-Sb chain and is a minor elemental constituent. We find

Similarity-based Imbalanced Classification (SBIC) that learns patterns in the
training data based on an empirical similarity function. To take the imbalanced
structure of the training data into account, SBIC utilizes the concept of
absent data, i.e. data from the minority class which can help better find the
boundary between the two classes. SBIC simultaneously optimizes the weights of
the empirical similarity function and finds the locations of absent data
points. As such, SBIC uses an embedded mechanism for synthetic data generation
which does not modify the training dataset, but alters the algorithm to suit
imbalanced datasets. Therefore, SBIC uses the ideas of both major schools of
thoughts in imbalanced classification: Like cost-sensitive approaches SBIC
operates on an algorithm level to handle imbalanced structures; and similar to
synthetic data generation approaches, it utilizes the properties of unobserved
data points from the minority class. The application of SBIC to imbalanced
datasets suggests it is comparable to, and in some cases outperforms, other
commonly used classification techniques for imbalanced datasets.

stars most likely formed through mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch
star that polluted the surface of the BS with the nucleosynthesis products
generated during thermal pulsations. This conclusion aligns with the results
from the substantial work done on the BSs in old open cluster NGC 188 that

We give a new bound that uses degree information to more tightly bound the

worst case bounds. We show that using only a constant amount of degree
information, we are able to obtain join algorithms with a running time that has
a smaller exponent than existing algorithms--{\em for any database instance}.
We also show that this degree information can be obtained in nearly linear

lower communication algorithms in the MapReduce setting.
  In the serial setting, the data complexity of join processing can be
expressed as a function $O(\IN^x + \OUT)$ in terms of input size $\IN$ and
output size $\OUT$ in which $x$ depends on the query. An upper bound for $x$ is
given by fractional hypertreewidth. We are interested in situations in which we

time, for a restricted class of joins which we call $1$-series-parallel graphs,
we obtain a complete decision procedure for identifying subquadratic
solvability (subject to the $3$-SUM problem requiring quadratic time). Our
$3$-SUM based quadratic lower bound is tight, making it the only known tight

model that are not observable or controllable in its associated physical
system. We focus on functional calibration, which arises in many manufacturing
processes where the unobservable features, called calibration variables, are a
function of the input variables. A major challenge in many applications is that
computational models are expensive and can only be evaluated a limited number
of times. Furthermore, without making strong assumptions, the calibration
variables are not identifiable. We propose Bayesian non-isometric matching
calibration (BNMC) that allows calibration of expensive computational models
with only a limited number of samples taken from a computational model and its
associated physical system. BNMC replaces the computational model with a
dynamic Gaussian process (GP) whose parameters are trained in the calibration
procedure. To resolve the identifiability issue, we present the calibration
problem from a geometric perspective of non-isometric curve to surface
matching, which enables us to take advantage of combinatorial optimization
techniques to extract necessary information for constructing prior
distributions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that in terms of
prediction accuracy BNMC outperforms, or is comparable to, other existing
calibration frameworks.

similar nature to that observed in non-colloidal suspensions, i.e., a
stress-induced transition from a flow of lubricated near-contacting particles
to a flow of a frictionally contacting network of particles. Abrupt (or
discontinuous) shear thickening is found to be a geometric rather than
hydrodynamic phenomenon; it stems from the strong sensitivity of the jamming
volume fraction to the nature of contact forces between suspended particles.
The thickening obtained in a colloidal suspension of purely hard frictional
spheres is qualitatively similar to experimental observations. However, the
agreement cannot be made quantitative with only hydrodynamics, frictional
contacts and Brownian forces. Therefore the role of a short-range repulsive
potential mimicking the stabilization of actual suspensions on the thickening
is studied. The effects of Brownian and repulsive forces on the onset stress

indirectly, from the observation that post-inflationary electric currents,

magnetic fields after inflation, are indeed vanishing on superhorizon scales

Pseudo-input Local Kriging (SPLK), which utilizes hyperplanes to partition a

find the desired hyperplanes. To alleviate the problem of discontinuity in the
global predictor, we impose continuity constraints on the boundaries of the
neighboring subdomains. Furthermore, partitioning the domain into smaller
subdomains makes it possible to use different parameter values for the
covariance function in each region and, therefore, the heterogeneity in the
data structure can be effectively captured. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that SPLK outperforms, or is comparable to, the algorithms commonly applied to

their host stars. Accurately measuring stellar masses is particularly important
because they likely influence planet occurrence and the architectures of
planetary systems. Single main-sequence stars typically have masses estimated
from evolutionary tracks, which generally provide accurate results due to their
extensive empirical calibration. However, the validity of this method for
subgiants and giants has been called into question by recent studies, with
suggestions that the masses of these evolved stars could have been
overestimated. We investigate these concerns using a sample of 59 benchmark
evolved stars with model-independent masses (from binary systems or
asteroseismology) obtained from the literature. We find very good agreement
between these benchmark masses and the ones estimated using evolutionary
tracks. The average fractional difference in the mass interval $\sim$0.7 - 4.5
M$_{\odot}$, is consistent with zero (-1.30 $\pm$ 2.42%), with no significant
trends in the residuals relative to the input parameters. A good agreement
between model-dependent and -independent radii (-4.81 $\pm$ 1.32%) and surface
gravities (0.71 $\pm$ 0.51%) is also found. The consistency between
independently determined ages for members of binary systems adds further
support for the accuracy of the method employed to derive the stellar masses.
Taken together, our results indicate that determination of masses of evolved
stars using grids of evolutionary tracks is not significantly affected by
systematic errors, and is thus valid for estimating the masses of isolated
stars beyond the main sequence.

with longer timescale variability, these observations place strong constraints
on the nature and location of the absorbing material. Swift monitoring has
revealed a secular decrease since ~2010 accompanied by flattening of the
optical and UV photometry that suggests variable reddening. Analysis of four
Hubble Space Telescope COS observations since 2010, including a Director's
Discretionary time observation during the occultation, shows that the
broad-absorption-line velocity offset and the CIV emission-line width both
decrease as the reddening increases. The occultation dynamical timescale, the
BAL variability dynamical timescale, and the density of the BAL gas show that
both the reddening material and the broad-absorption-line gas are consistent
with an origin in the torus. These observations can be explained by a scenario
in which the torus is clumpy with variable scale height, and the BAL gas is
blown from the torus material like spray from the crest of a wave. As the
obscuring material passes into our line of sight, we alternately see
high-velocity broad absorption lines and a clear view to the central engine, or
low-velocity broad absorption lines and strong reddening. WPVS 007 has a small

applied to a non-intrusive gas concentration measurement of a mixing flow in a
millimeter-scale channel. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen were chosen as test
fluids and CARS signals from the fluids were generated by adjusting the
wavelengths of the Pump and the Stokes beams. The generated CARS signals, whose
wavelengths are different from those of the Pump and the Stokes beams, were
captured by an EM-CCD camera after filtering out the excitation beams. A
calibration experiment was performed in order to confirm the applicability of
the built-up CARS system by measuring the intensity of the CARS signal from
known concentrations of the samples. After confirming that the measured CARS
intensity was proportional to the second power of the concentrations as was
theoretically predicted, the CARS intensities in the gas mixing flow channel
were measured. Ten different measurement points were set and concentrations of
both carbon dioxide and nitrogen at each point were obtained. Consequently, it
was observed that the mixing of two fluids progressed as the measurement point
moved downstream. The results show the applicability of CARS to the
non-intrusive concentration measurement of gas flows without any preprocess
such as gas absorption into liquid or solid.

interface between a core of quark matter and a mantle of nuclear matter.
  Firstly, we analyze the mass-radius relation. We describe a generic ""Constant
Speed of Sound"" (CSS) parameterization of the quark matter equation of state
(EoS), in which the speed of sound is independent of density. In terms of the
three parameters of the CSS EoS we obtain the phase diagram of possible forms
of the hybrid star mass-radius relation, and we show how observational
constraints on the maximum mass and typical radius of neutron stars can be
expressed as constraints on the CSS parameters.
  Secondly, we propose a mechanism for the damping of density oscillations,
including r-modes, in hybrid stars with a sharp interface. The dissipation
arises from the periodic conversion between quark matter and nuclear matter
induced by the pressure oscillations in the star. We find the damping grows
nonlinearly with the amplitude of the oscillation and is powerful enough to
saturate an r-mode at very low saturation amplitude, of order $10^{-10}$, which
is compatible with currently-available observations of neutron star spin
frequencies and temperatures.

This exponential decay arises from a statistical charge transfer process where
a particle can be effectively ""transported"" to an arbitrary lattice site. In a
many-body localized phase, this non-local transport and the associated
exponential StOC phenomenon persist in the presence of interactions. We study
experimental consequences of the exponential StOC on Loschmidt echo and

cold atomic experiments through Ramsey interference and radio-frequency
spectroscopy.

volume of the outer halo, i.e. with SCUSS data blue horizontal branch (BHB)
stars can trace the outer halo of the Milky Way as far as 100-150 kpc.
Utilizing this advantage we combine SCUSS u band with SDSS DR9 gri photometric
bands to identify BHB stars and explore halo substructures. We confirm the
existence of the Pisces overdensity, which is a structure in the outer halo (at
around 80 kpc) that was discovered using RR Lyrae stars. For the first time we

a stream with a clear distance gradient. The stream, which is ~5 degrees wide
and stretches along ~25 degrees, consists of 20-30 BHBs with a total
significance of around 6sigma over the background. Assuming we have detected
the entire stream and that the progenitor has fully disrupted, then the number
of BHBs suggests the original system was similar to smaller classical or a
larger ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. On the other hand, if the progenitor still
exists, it can be hunted for by reconstructing its orbit from the distance
gradient of the stream. This new picture of the Pisces overdensity sheds new

relativity through covariance under the full diffeomorphism group. We show how
this independence can be maintained in a Hamilton-Jacobi approach that does not
accord special privilege to any geometric structure. Intrinsic spacetime
curvature based coordinates grant equal status to all geometric backgrounds.
They play an essential role as a starting point for inequivalent semi-classical
quantizations. The scheme calls into question Wheeler's geometrodynamical
approach and the associated Wheeler-DeWitt equation in which three-metrics are
featured geometrical objects. The formalism deals with variables that are
manifestly invariant under the full diffeomorphism group. Yet, perhaps
paradoxically, the liberty in selecting intrinsic coordinates is precisely as
broad as is the original diffeomorphism freedom. We show how various ideas from
the past five decades concerning the true degrees of freedom of general
relativity can be interpreted in light of this new constrained Hamiltonian
description. In particular, we show how the Kucha\v{r} multi-fingered time
approach can be understood as a means of introducing full four-dimensional
diffeomorphism invariants. Every choice of new phase space variables yields new
Einstein-Hamilton-Jacobi constraining relations, and corresponding intrinsic
Schr\""odinger equations. We show how to implement this freedom by canonical
transformation of the intrinsic Hamiltonian. We also reinterpret and rectify

projection chamber (TPC), that is the Compton-scattering target and the tracker
of recoil electrons, and a position-sensitive scintillation camera that absorbs
of the scattered gamma rays, to measure gamma rays in the environment from
contaminated soil. To measure of environmental gamma rays from soil

system for the SMILE-II experiment. We checked the gamma-ray imaging ability
and ETCC performance in the laboratory by using several gamma-ray point
sources. The performance test indicates that the field of view (FoV) of the

gamma-ray source with a significance of 5$\sigma$ in 13 min in the laboratory.
In this paper, we report the specifications of the ETCC and the results of the

the resulting soft parameters are derived. New interference terms between the
GMSB type and AMSB type contributions are the unique feature of this scenario.
Messenger-matter interactions involving sleptons can be used to solve the
tachyonic slepton problem and naturally lead to positive slepton masses
regardless of the sign of deflection parameter. Besides, due to the new
contributions, large $|A_t|$ that will not trigger color-breaking stop VEV are
also possible in this scenario, thus can easily give the 125 GeV higgs which
was discovered by LHC. This type of deflected AMSB scenario need very few
messenger species, thus can avoid possible non-perturbative gauge couplings
below the GUT scale ( or Landau pole below the Planck scale ).

neighbors and perform any local computations. The topology of the network is
unknown and nodes are unlabeled, but ports at each node have arbitrary fixed
labelings which, together with the topology of the network, can create
asymmetries to be exploited in leader election. We consider two versions of the
leader election problem: strong LE in which exactly one leader has to be
elected, if this is possible, while all nodes must terminate declaring that
leader election is impossible otherwise, and weak LE, which differs from strong
LE in that no requirement on the behavior of nodes is imposed, if leader
election is impossible. We show that the time of leader election depends on
three parameters of the network: its diameter $D$, its size $n$, and its level
of symmetry $\lambda$, which, when leader election is feasible, is the smallest
depth at which some node has a unique view of the network. It also depends on
the knowledge by the nodes, or lack of it, of parameters $D$ and $n$.

popular regularizations for image processing problems and has sparked a
tremendous amount of research, particularly to move from scalar to
vector-valued functions. In this paper, we consider the gradient of a color
image as a three dimensional matrix or tensor with dimensions corresponding to
the spatial extend, the differences to other pixels, and the spectral channels.
The smoothness of this tensor is then measured by taking different norms along
the different dimensions. Depending on the type of these norms one obtains very
different properties of the regularization, leading to novel models for color
images. We call this class of regularizations collaborative total variation
(CTV). On the theoretical side, we characterize the dual norm, the
subdifferential and the proximal mapping of the proposed regularizers. We
further prove, with the help of the generalized concept of singular vectors,
that an $\ell^{\infty}$ channel coupling makes the most prior assumptions and
has the greatest potential to reduce color artifacts. Our practical
contributions consist of an extensive experimental section where we compare the
performance of a large number of collaborative TV methods for inverse problems

search algorithm based on continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW). However, this
algorithm is known to run in optimal time only for a handful of graphs. In this
work, we prove that for Erd\""os-Renyi random graphs, i.e.\ graphs of $n$
vertices where each edge exists with probability $p$, search by CTQW is
\textit{almost surely} optimal as long as $p\geq \log^{3/2}(n)/n$.
Consequently, we show that quantum spatial search is in fact optimal for
\emph{almost all} graphs, meaning that the fraction of graphs of $n$ vertices
for which this optimality holds tends to one in the asymptotic limit. We obtain
this result by proving that search is optimal on graphs where the ratio between
the second largest and the largest eigenvalue is bounded by a constant smaller
than 1. Finally, we show that we can extend our results on search to establish
high fidelity quantum communication between two arbitrary nodes of a random
network of interacting qubits, namely to perform quantum state transfer, as
well as entanglement generation. Our work shows that quantum information tasks
typically designed for structured systems retain performance in very disordered

three observations of NGC6946 X-1, but data from other ULXs are generally not
sufficient to constrain any rms-flux relation. The presence of this relation
was previously reported in only two observations of NGC 5408X-1; our results
show this is a persistent property of the variability of NGC5408 X-1 and
extends to at least one other variable ULX. We speculate this is a ubiquitous
property of ULX variability, as it is for X-ray variability in other luminous
accreting sources. We also recover the time delay between hard and soft bands
in NGC5408 X-1, with the soft band (<1 keV) delayed with respect to the hard
band (>1 keV) by up to ~10 s (~0.2 rad) at frequencies above ~few mHz. For the
first time, we extend the lag analysis to lower frequencies and find some
evidence for a reversal of the lag, a hard lag of ~1 ks at frequencies of ~0.1
mHz. Our energy-resolved analysis shows the time delays are energy dependent.
We argue that the lag is unlikely to be a result of reflection from an
accretion disc (`reverberation') based on the lack of reflection features in
the spectra, and the large size of the reflector inferred from the magnitude of
the lag. We also argue that associating the soft lag with a quasi-periodic
oscillation (QPO) in these ULXs - and drawing an analogy between soft lags in
ULXs and soft lags seen in some low-frequency QPOs of Galactic X-ray binaries -
is premature.

winds in the gravitational potential of a dark matter halo (DMH) with a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) are studied. The solutions are classified in
terms of their topological features, and the gravitational potential of the
SMBH adds a new branch to the transonic solutions generated by the gravity of
the DMH. The topological types of the transonic solutions depend on the mass
distribution, the amount of supplied energy, the polytropic index $\gamma$, and
the slope $\alpha$ of the DMH mass distribution. When $\alpha$ becomes larger
than a critical value $\alpha_\mathrm{c}$, the transonic solution types change
dramatically. Further, our model predicts that it is possible for a slowly
accelerating outflow to exist, even in quiescent galaxies with small $\gamma$.
This slowly accelerating outflow differs from those considered in many of the
previous studies focusing on supersonic outflows in active star-forming
galaxies. In addition, our model indicates that outflows in active star-forming
galaxies have only one transonic point in the inner region ($\sim$ 0.01 kpc).
The locus of this transonic point does not strongly depend on $\gamma$. We
apply the polytropic model incorporating mass flux supplied by stellar
components to the Sombrero Galaxy, and conclude that it can reproduce the
observed gas density and the temperature distribution well. This result differs
significantly from the isothermal model, which requires an unrealistically
large mass flux (Igarashi et al. 2014). Thus, we conclude that the polytropic
model is more realistic than the isothermal model, and that the Sombrero Galaxy
can have a slowly accelerating outflow.

at up to 13 MeV u-1 or are sharper than thermal. The fastest sharp peak may
indicate shock-wave acceleration by many-body energy transfer. A magnetic field
of 0.4 T deflects only a small part of the multi-MeV particle flux which thus
mainly consists of neutral particles. By combining the TOF method with magnetic

any slower particle emission from the target. The neutral multi-MeV particles

entropy (i.e. is a Beurling-Carleson set) if and only if any singular measure
supported on $E$ gives rise to a wepable singular inner function. As a
corollary, we see that singular measures which spread their mass too evenly
cannot give rise to wepable singular inner functions. Furthermore, we prove
that the stronger property of porosity of $E$ is equivalent to a stronger form
of wepability (""easy wepability"") for the singular inner functions with support

lead to a deficit of cluster members with excess in JHKs and Spitzer/IRAC bands

sufficient surface density of disk-bearing sources to reliably test for spatial

graphs, based on non-parametric estimation of edge density in directed
multigraphs. Following coclustering approach, we use a clustering of the
vertices, with a piecewise constant estimation of the density of the edges
across the clusters, and address the problem of automatically and reliably
inferring the number of clusters, which is the granularity of the coclustering.
We use a model selection technique with data-dependent prior and obtain an
exact evaluation criterion for the posterior probability of edge density
estimation models. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that our
data-dependent modeling technique is consistent, resilient to noise, valid non
asymptotically and asymptotically behaves as an universal approximator of the
true edge density in directed multigraphs. We evaluate our method using
artificial graphs and present its practical interest on real world graphs. The
method is both robust and scalable. It is able to extract insightful patterns
in the unsupervised learning setting and to provide state of the art accuracy
when used as a preparation step for supervised learning.

computed as a weighted average of the official duration of each cycle and
attainment rates, thus omitting differences in educational achievement within
levels of education. This aggregation into different groups may result in a
loss of information introducing, therefore, a potential source of measurement
error. We explore here a more nuanced alternative to estimate educational
attainment, which considers the continuous nature of the educational variable.
This `continuous approach' allows us to impose more plausible assumptions about
the distribution of years of schooling within each level of education, and to
take into account the right censoring of the data in the estimation, thus
leading to more accurate estimates of educational attainment and education
inequality. These improved series may help to better understand the role of
education on different socio-economic aspects, such as quality of life and
human capital formation.

interdependent. While significant research has explored the resilience of
interdependent networks, there has been no analysis of the effects of
modularity. Here we develop a theoretical framework for attacks on
interdependent modular networks and support our results by simulations. We
focus on the case where each network has the same number of communities and the
dependency links are restricted to be between pairs of communities of different
networks. This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city
has its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within
the city. However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities.
For example, a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication
network, yet a power station and communication tower that are interdependent
will likely be in the same city. It has been shown that single networks are
very susceptible to the failure of the interconnected nodes (between
communities) Shai et al. and that attacks on these nodes are more crippling
than attacks based on betweenness da Cunha et al. In our example of cities
these nodes have long range links which are more likely to fail. For both
treelike and looplike interdependent modular networks we find distinct regimes
depending on the number of modules, $m$. (i) In the case where there are fewer
modules with strong intraconnections, the system first separates into modules
in an abrupt first-order transition and then each module undergoes a second
percolation transition. (ii) When there are more modules with many
interconnections between them, the system undergoes a single transition.
Overall, we find that modular structure can influence the type of transitions
observed in interdependent networks and should be considered in attempts to
make interdependent networks more resilient.

of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), found using public imaging from the first
year of the Dark Energy Survey. The structure appears to emanate from the edge
of the outer LMC disk at a radius $\approx 13.5$ degrees due north of its
centre, and stretches more than $10$ kpc towards the east. It is roughly $1.5$
kpc wide and has an integrated $V$-band luminosity of at least $M_V = -7.4$.
The stellar populations in the feature are indistinguishable from those in the
outer LMC disk. We attempt to quantify the geometry of the outer disk using
simple planar models, and find that only a disk with mild intrinsic ellipticity
can simultaneously explain the observed stellar density on the sky and the
azimuthal line-of-sight distance profile. We also see possible non-planar
behaviour in the outer disk that may reflect a warp and/or flare, as well as
deviations that resemble a ring-like structure between $\sim9-12$ degrees from
the LMC centre. Based on all these observations, we conclude that our remote,
stream-like feature is likely comprised of material that has been stripped from
the outskirts of the LMC disk, although we cannot rule out that it represents a
transient overdensity in the disk itself. We conduct a simple $N$-body
simulation to show that either type of structure could plausibly arise due to
the tidal force of the Milky Way; however we also recognize that a recent close
interaction between the LMC and the SMC may be the source of the stripping or
perturbation. Finally, we observe evidence for extremely diffuse LMC
populations extending to radii of $\sim 18.5$ kpc in the disk plane ($\approx
20$ degrees on the sky), corroborating previous spectroscopic detections at
comparable distances.

characterized by a random length scale. The resulting stochastic process shows
subdiffusion with a behavior in qualitative agreement with single particle
tracking experiments in living cells, such as ergodicity breaking, p-variation
and aging. In particular, this approach recapitulates characteristic features
previously described in part by the fractional Brownian motion and in part by
the continuous-time random walk. Moreover, for a proper distribution of the
length scale, a single parameter controls the ergodic-to-nonergodic transition
and, remarkably, also drives the transition of the diffusion equation of the
process from non-fractional to fractional, thus demonstrating that fractional
kinetics emerges from ergodicity breaking.

However, one could also invoke a steep density gradient created by inward drift

explain the formation of close-in super Earths. Here we show that the asteroid
belt's orbital excitation provides a crucial constraint against this scenario
for the Solar System. We performed a series of simulations of terrestrial
planet formation and asteroid belt evolution starting from disks of
planetesimals and planetary embryos with various radial density gradients and
including Jupiter and Saturn on nearly circular and coplanar orbits. Disks with
shallow density gradients reproduce the dynamical excitation of the asteroid
belt by gravitational self-stirring but form Mars analogs significantly more
massive than the real planet. In contrast, a disk with a surface density
gradient proportional to $r^{-5.5}$ reproduces the Earth/Mars mass ratio but
leaves the asteroid belt in a dynamical state that is far colder than the real
belt. We conclude that no disk profile can simultaneously explain the structure
of the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt. The asteroid belt must have been
depleted and dynamically excited by a different mechanism such as, for
instance, in the Grand Tack scenario.

(DM) can leave imprints in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy
power spectrum. However, the relevance of DM annihilations in halos for
cosmological observables is still subject to debate, with previous works
reaching different conclusions on this point. Also, all previous studies used a
single type of parameterization for the astrophysical reionization, and
included no astrophysical source for the heating of the intergalactic medium.
In this work, we revisit these problems. When standard approaches are adopted,
we find that the ionization fraction does exhibit a very particular (and
potentially constraining) pattern, but the currently measurable optical depth
to reionization is left almost unchanged: In agreement with the most of the
previous literature, for plausible halo models we find that the modification of
the signal with respect to the one coming from annihilations in the smooth
background is tiny, below cosmic variance within currently allowed parameter
space. However, if different and probably more realistic treatments of the
astrophysical sources of reionization and heating are adopted, a more
pronounced effect of the DM annihilation in halos is possible. We thus conclude
that within currently adopted baseline models the impact of the virialised DM
structures cannot be uncovered by CMB power spectra measurements, but a larger
impact is possible if peculiar models are invoked for the redshift evolution of
the DM annihilation signal or different assumptions are made for the
astrophysical contributions. A better understanding (both theoretical and
observational) of the reionization and temperature history of the universe,
notably via the 21 cm signal, seems the most promising way for using halo
formation as a tool in DM searches, improving over the sensitivity of current
cosmological probes.

the differential emission measure (DEM) at different locations in the

pattern is unclear in this data set. We obtain an electron density of log(n_e)

the applicability of this approach to small system sizes. Methods based on the
time evolution of a single pure quantum state can be used to study larger
systems. One such method exploits the property that the expectation value of
the autocorrelation function obtained for a few samples of so-called thermal
typical states yields a good estimate of the thermal equilibrium value. In this
paper, we propose a new method based on a Wiener-Khinchin-like theorem for
quantum system. By comparison with exact diagonalization results, it is shown
that both methods yield correct results. As the Wiener-Khinchin-based method
involves sampling over thermal typical states, we study the statistical
properties of the sampling distribution. Effects due to finite observation time
are investigated and found to be different for the two methods but it is also
found that for both methods, the effects vanish as the system size increases.

of a Fermi-LAT excess in the Reticulum-2 dwarf galaxy have been put forward as
signatures compatible with of neutralino dark matter. These are of particular
interest as the neutralino annihilation models which fit these observations
might have observable consequences from radio to gamma-ray emission. Since dark
matter is expected to be a major matter constituent of cosmic structure, these
multi-frequency consequences should also be common to structures across the
mass spectrum. Thus, in this work we make predictions for the multi-frequency
spectra of three well-known sources dominated by dark matter, e.g. the Coma
cluster, the galaxy M81, and the Draco dwarf galaxy using models favoured by
dark matter interpretations of the aforementioned observations. We pay special
attention to the consequences for these models when their cross-sections are
renormalised to reproduce the recent gamma-ray excess observed in the
Reticulum-2 dwarf galaxy, which throw a dark matter interpretation of this
excess into doubt. We find that the multi-frequency data of Coma and Draco
disfavour the dark matter interpretation of the AMS, PAMELA and Fermi
anti-particle excess. Models derived from Fermi-LAT galactic centre
observations present somewhat lesser conflicts. We determine the detection
prospects of the Square Kilometre Array, the Cherenkov Telescope Array, as well
as the ASTROGAM and ASTRO-H satellites for the studied models. This
demonstrates that ASTRO-H is well positioned to probe the X-ray emissions from
neutralino annihilation. Thus, multi-frequency observation with the next

resulting phenomena: tidal heating and tidal disruption, binary capture and
hyper-velocity star ejection, gravitational wave (GW) emission by inspiraling
compact remnants, or hydrodynamical interactions with an accretion disk, are of
interest as they can produce observable signatures and thereby reveal the
existence of the MBH, affect its mass and spin evolution, probe strong gravity,
and provide information on stars and gas near the MBH. The continuous loss of
stars and the processes that resupply them shape the central stellar
distribution. We investigate relativistic stellar dynamics near the loss-cone
of a non-spinning MBH in steady-state analytically and by Monte Carlo
simulations of the diffusion of the orbital parameters. These take into account
Newtonian mass precession due to enclosed stellar mass, in-plane precession due
to general relativity, dissipation by GW, uncorrelated two-body relaxation,
correlated resonant relaxation (RR) and adiabatic invariance due to secular
precession, using a rigorously derived description of correlated post-Newtonian
dynamics in the diffusion limit. We argue that general maximal entropy
considerations strongly constrain orbital diffusion in steady-state,
irrespective of the relaxation mechanism. We identify the exact phase-space
separatrix between plunges and inspirals, predict their steady-state rates, and
verify they are robust under a wide range of assumptions. We derive the
dependence of the rates on the mass of the MBH, show that the contribution of
RR is small, and discuss special cases where unquenched RR in restricted

opportunities to probe both the long-wavelength mass-mixing parameters (delta

together with the subtle interference effects associated with the neutrino mass
hierarchy (either normal or inverted). In a given experimental setting - here
taken as in the JUNO project for definiteness - the achievable hierarchy
sensitivity and parameter accuracy depend not only on the accumulated

state-of-the-art estimates. It turns out that energy-scale and flux-shape
systematics can noticeably affect the performance of a JUNO-like experiment,
both on the hierarchy discrimination and on precision oscillation physics. It
is shown that a significant reduction of the assumed energy-scale and

Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) since its own inauguration
in 2007. HAWC and VERITAS are separated by only 14 degrees in longitude, and so
can view much of the same sky at the same time. In combination with other
ground-based facilities, and with the instruments onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, VERITAS and HAWC will give an unprecedented view of the
gamma-ray sky. We provide an overview of VERITAS, and discuss the
complementarity of the two observatories for future gamma-ray observations.

fields, many of which display strong bands of azimuthal fields that are
toroidal. A number of explanations have been proposed to explain how such
fields might be generated though none are definitive. In this paper, we examine
the toroidal fields of a sample of 55 stars with magnetic maps, with masses in
the range 0.1-1.5$\,{\rm M}_\odot$. We find that the energy contained in
toroidal fields has a power law dependence on the energy contained in poloidal
fields. However the power index is not constant across our sample, with stars
less and more massive than 0.5$\,{\rm M}_\odot$ having power indices of
0.72$\pm$0.08 and 1.25$\pm$0.06 respectively. There is some evidence that these
two power laws correspond to stars in the saturated and unsaturated regimes of
the rotation-activity relation. Additionally, our sample shows that strong
toroidal fields must be generated axisymmetrically. The latitudes at which
these bands appear depend on the stellar rotation period with fast rotators
displaying higher latitude bands than slow rotators. The results in this paper
present new constraints for future dynamo studies.

up-crossing (crossing points with positive slope at a given threshold of height
($\alpha$)), and $N_{tot}$ (the generalized roughness function), it is possible
to distinguish the nature of anisotropy, rotational invariance and Gaussianity
of any given surface. For the case of anisotropic correlated self- or

The method systematically distinguishes the directions of anisotropy, at

typical method in determining the corresponding scaling exponents in identified
anisotropic directions, we are able to determine the kind and ratio of
correlation length anisotropy. To demonstrate capability and accuracy of the

calculated on synthetic stochastic rough interfaces and rough interfaces

geometrical disorder as commonly conjectured, which has substantial
consequences on the mechanical properties of wet granular beds, including a
history dependent rheology and lowered strength. Our findings are obtained
using a novel model where the Laplace pressures, bridge volumes and contact
angles are dynamical variables associated to the contact points. While
accounting for contact line pinning, we track the temporal evolution of each
bridge. We observe a cross-over to a power-law decay of the variance of
capillary pressures at late times and a saturation of the variance of bridge
volumes to a finite value connected to contact line pinning. Large scale
simulations of liquid transport in the bridge network reveal that the
equilibration dynamics at early times is well described by a mean field model.
The spread of final bridge volumes can be directly related to the magnitude of
contact angle hysteresis.

the Adaptive Extended Stencil Finite Element Method (AES-FEM) as a means for
overcoming this dependence on element shape quality. Our method replaces the
traditional basis functions with a set of generalized Lagrange polynomial (GLP)
basis functions, which we construct using local weighted least-squares
approximations. The method preserves the theoretical framework of FEM, and
allows imposing essential boundary conditions and integrating the stiffness
matrix in the same way as the classical FEM. In addition, AES-FEM can use
higher-degree polynomial basis functions than the classical FEM, while
virtually preserving the sparsity pattern of the stiffness matrix. We describe
the formulation and implementation of AES-FEM, and analyze its consistency and
stability. We present numerical experiments in both 2D and 3D for the Poison
equation and a time-independent convection-diffusion equation. The numerical
results demonstrate that AES-FEM is more accurate than linear FEM, is also more
efficient than linear FEM in terms of error versus runtime, and enables much
better stability and faster convergence of iterative solvers than linear FEM

Conclusions Training on a multiple sclerosis (MS) microarray data using both
SAM-GSR and our modification of SAM-GSR, excellent discriminative performance
on an independent test set was achieved. To conclude, absorbing biological
information from a gene set may be helpful for classification and feature
selection. Discussion Given the fact the complete pathway information is far
from completeness, a statistical method capable of constructing biologically
meaningful gene networks is in demand. The basic requirement is that interplay
among genes must be taken into account.

with vanishing cosmological constant, with initial conditions as in standard
linear perturbation theory. A non-perturbative approach to the dynamics of such
a universe is combined with a distance formula based on the Sachs optical
equations. Then a numerical study implies a redshift-distance relation that
roughly agrees with observations. Interpreted in the standard homogeneous
setup, our results would appear to imply the currently accepted values for the
Hubble rate and the deceleration parameter; furthermore there is consistency
with density perturbations at last scattering. The determination of these three
quantities relies only on a single parameter related to a cutoff scale.
Discrepancies with the existing literature are related to subtleties of higher
order perturbation theory which make both the reliability of the present
approach and the magnitude of perturbative effects beyond second order hard to
assess.

renormalization scale of the QCD running coupling in order to achieve maximally
precise fixed-order predictions for physical observables. The Principle of
Maximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the ambiguities associated with the
conventional renormalization scale-setting procedure, giving predictions which
are independent of the choice of renormalization scheme. The scales of the QCD
couplings and the effective number of quark flavors are set order by order in
the pQCD series. The PMC has a solid theoretical foundation, satisfying the
standard renormalization group invariance and all of the the self-consistency
conditions derived from the renormalization group......In this brief report, we
summarize the results of our recent PMC applications for a number of collider
processes, emphasizing their generality and applicability....... These results
demonstrate that the application of the PMC systematically eliminates a major
theoretical uncertainty for pQCD predictions, thus increasing the sensitivity
of the colliders to possible new physics beyond the Standard Model.

are used to topologically characterize near force-free magnetic fields which
describe a variety of physical processes, including plasma equilibrium. As a
byproduct, the topological characterization of force-free magnetic fields
associated with current-carrying links, as conjectured by Crager and Kotiuga,
is shown to be necessary and conditions for sufficiency are given. Along the
way a paradox is exposed: The seemingly unintuitive mathematical tools, often
associated to higher dimensional topology, have their origins in three
dimensional contexts but in the hands of late-onset visually impaired
topologists. This paradox was previously exposed in the context of algorithms
for the visualization of three-dimensional magnetic fields. For this reason,
the paper concludes by developing connections between mathematics and cognitive
science in this specific context.

grids and transportation to ecology, climate, biology and even human
communities and the Internet, have been examined through network science. While
the response to perturbations has been quantified, recovery strategies for
perturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through
anecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science-based quantitative
methods framework for measuring, comparing and interpreting hazard responses
and as well as recovery strategies. The framework, motivated by the recently
proposed temporal resilience paradigm, is demonstrated with the Indian Railways
Network. The methods are demonstrated through the resilience of the network to
natural or human-induced hazards and electric grid failure. Simulations
inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as
well as a cyber-physical attack scenario. Multiple metrics are used to generate
various recovery strategies, which are simply sequences in which system
components should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of
recovery strategies suggests that faster and more resource-effective recovery
is possible through network centrality measures. Case studies based on two
historical events, specifically the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2012
North Indian blackout, and a simulated cyber-physical attack scenario, provides
means for interpreting the relative performance of various recovery strategies.
Quantitative evaluation of recovery strategies suggests that faster and more
resource-effective restoration is possible through network centrality measures,
even though the specific strategy may be different for sub-networks or for the
partial recovery.
