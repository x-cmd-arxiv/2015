theoretically investigated for a localized spin model that includes a staggered
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction and anisotropic exchange interactions, which
arise from the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling and the multi-orbital
correlation effect. We show that the model exhibits a Neel-type
antiferromagnetic order, which simultaneously accompanies a ferroic toroidal
order. We find that the occurrence of toroidal order modulates the magnon
dispersion in an asymmetric way with respect to the wave number: a toroidal
dipole order on the zigzag chain leads to a band-bottom shift, while a toroidal
octupole order on the honeycomb lattice gives rise to a valley splitting. These
asymmetric magnon excitations could be a source of unusual magnetic responses,
such as nonreciprocal magnon transport. A variety of modulations are discussed
while changing the lattice and magnetic symmetries. Implications of candidate
materials for asymmetric magnon excitations are presented.

  problems",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In various industrial contexts, estimating the distribution of unobserved
random vectors Xi from some noisy indirect observations H(Xi) + Ui is required.
If the relation between Xi and the quantity H(Xi), measured with the error Ui,
is implemented by a CPU-consuming computer model H, a major practical
difficulty is to perform the statistical inference with a relatively small
number of runs of H. Following Fu et al. (2014), a Bayesian statistical
framework is considered to make use of possible prior knowledge on the
parameters of the distribution of the Xi, which is assumed Gaussian. Moreover,
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is carried out to estimate their
posterior distribution by replacing H by a kriging metamodel build from a
limited number of simulated experiments. Two heuristics, involving two
different criteria to be optimized, are proposed to sequentially design these
computer experiments in the limits of a given computational budget. The first
criterion is a Weighted Integrated Mean Square Error (WIMSE). The second one,
called Expected Conditional Divergence (ECD), developed in the spirit of the
Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) criterion, is based on the discrepancy
between two consecutive approximations of the target posterior distribution.
Several numerical comparisons conducted over a toy example then a motivating
real case-study show that such adaptive designs can significantly outperform
the classical choice of a maximin Latin Hypercube Design (LHD) of experiments.
Dealing with a major concern in hydraulic engineering, a particular emphasis is
placed upon the prior elicitation of the case-study, highlighting the overall
feasibility of the methodology. Faster convergences and manageability
considerations lead to recommend the use of the ECD criterion in practical
applications.

process, the consideration of a separable function which is the sum of two
convex functions, one of them possibly non-smooth. Recently a few works have
discussed inexact versions of several accelerated proximal methods aiming at
solving this minimization problem. This paper shows that inexact versions of a
method of Beck and Teboulle (FISTA) preserve, in a Hilbert space setting, the
same (non-asymptotic) rate of convergence under some assumptions on the decay
rate of the error terms. The notion of inexactness discussed here seems to be
rather simple, but, interestingly, when comparing to related works, closely
related decay rates of the errors terms yield closely related convergence
rates. The derivation sheds some light on the somewhat mysterious origin of
some parameters which appear in various accelerated methods. A consequence of
the analysis is that the accelerated method is perturbation resilient, making
it suitable, in principle, for the superiorization methodology. By taking this
into account, we re-examine the superiorization methodology and significantly
extend its scope.

the scalar superpartner of the Goldstone fermion associated with SUSY breaking,
the sgoldstino. This scalar couples strongly to the Standard Model vector
bosons and weakly to the fermions, with all coupling strengths determined by
ratios of soft SUSY breaking parameters over the SUSY breaking scale.
Explaining the ATLAS excess selects particular relations and ranges for the

emerges from the covariant theory of the scalar field $\phi$ with the

$\Lambda(t)=\Lambda_{\text{bare}}+\frac{\alpha^2}{t^2}$ we show the existence
of a mechanism of the modification of the scaling law for energy density of
dark matter: $\rho_{\text{dm}}\propto a^{-3+\lambda(t)}$. We discuss the
evolution of $\Lambda(t)$ term and pointed out that during the cosmic evolution
there is a long phase in which this term is approximately constant. This effect
justifies Alcaniz and Lima's approach to $\Lambda(H)$ cosmologies. We also
present the statistical analysis of both the $\Lambda(t)$CDM model with dark
energy and decaying dark matter and the $\Lambda$CDM standard cosmological
model. We divide the observational data into two groups: low $z$ data (SNIa,
BAO, $H(z)$ and AP test) and high $z$ data (Planck, WP and lensing). While for
the former we find the best fit value of the parameter $\lambda$ is positive
($\lambda=0.0338$, energy transfer is from the dark energy to dark matter
sector), for the latter we find that $\lambda$ is $-0.0199$ which is an
evidence that the energy transfer is from decaying dark matter. This
disagreement correlates with estimated values of $H_0$ ($67.77$ km/(s Mpc) and
$65.62$ km/(s Mpc) respectively). The decaying dark matter causes to lowering a
mass of dark matter particles which are lighter than CDM particles and remain
relativistic. The rate of the process of decaying matter is estimated. We show
that in the models of decaying dark matter, the cosmological constant problem
disappears naturally. The model with decaying dark matter possesses one
parameter more but in light of the AIC it is better than the $\Lambda$CDM
standard cosmological model.

respect to the background magnetic field, using linear and quasi-linear

anisotropic alpha particles can drive a parallel fire hose instability
analogous to that generated by protons, but that, remarkably, the instability
can be triggered also when the parallel plasma beta of alpha particles is below
unity. The wave activity generated by the alpha anisotropy affects the
evolution of the more abundant protons, leading to their anisotropic heating.
When both ion species have sufficient parallel anisotropies both of them can
drive the instability, and we observe generation of two distinct peaks in the
spectra of the fluctuations, with longer wavelengths associated to alphas and
shorter ones to protons. If a non-zero relative drift is present, the unstable
modes propagate preferentially in the direction of the drift associated with
the unstable species. The generated waves scatter particles and reduce their
temperature anisotropy to marginally stable state, and, moreover, they
significantly reduce the relative drift between the two ion populations. The
coexistence of modes excited by both species leads to saturation of the plasma
in distinct regions of the beta/anisotropy parameter space for protons and
alpha particles, in good agreement with in situ solar wind observations. Our
results confirm that fire hose instabilities are likely at work in the solar
wind and limit the anisotropy of different ion species in the plasma.

velocities ($v \sin i$ $\gtrsim$ 170 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) and are expected to
be oblate. These interferometric measurements, the stars' observed photometric
energy distributions, and $v \sin i$ values are used to computationally
construct model oblate stars from which stellar properties (inclination,
rotational velocity, and the radius and effective temperature as a function of
latitude, etc.) are determined. The results are compared with MESA stellar
evolution models (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013) to determine masses and ages. The
value of this new technique is that it enables the estimation of the
fundamental properties of rapidly rotating stars without the need to fully
image the star. It can thus be applied to stars with sizes comparable to the
interferometric resolution limit as opposed to those that are several times
larger than the limit. Under the assumption of coevality, the spread in ages
can be used as a test of both the prescription presented here and the MESA
evolutionary code for rapidly rotating stars. With our validated technique, we
combine these age estimates and determine the age of the moving group to be 414

importance of these chains to characterizing the stress state and dynamics of
the system, there is no common framework for quantifying their their
properties. Recently, attention has turned to the tools of network science as a
promising route to such a description. In this paper, we apply community
detection techniques to numerically-generated packings of spheres over a range
of interparticle friction coefficients and confining pressures. In order to
extract chain-like features, we use a modularity maximization with a
recently-developed geographical null model \cite{Bassett2015}, and optimize the
technique to detect branched structures by minimizing the normalized convex
hull of the detected communities. We characterize the force chain communities
by their size (number of particles), network strength (internal forces), and
normalized convex hull ratio (sparseness). We find the that the first two
exhibit an approximately linear correlation and are therefore largely
redundant. For both pressure $P$ and interparticle friction $\mu$, we observe
crossovers in behavior. For $\mu \lesssim 0.1$, the packings exhibit more
sensitivity to pressure. In addition, we identify a crossover pressure where
the frictional dependence switches from having more large/strong communities at
low $\mu$ vs. high $\mu$. We explain these phenomena by comparison to the
spatial distribution of communities along the vertical axis of the system.
These results provide new tools for considering the mesoscale structure of a
granular system and pave the way for reduced descriptions based on the force
chain structure.

this to the role of correlations in uncertainty quantification of
non-renormalizable effective field theories of the nuclear regime. In addition,

shapes to galaxies, instead compressing the pixel data D into a vector of

vertex set consisting of all complete subgraphs of G, on which f changes sign
and where x,y are connected if one is contained in the other. For d-graphs,
finite simple graphs for which every unit sphere is a d-sphere, the zero locus
of (f-c) is a (d-1)-graph for all c different from the range of f. If this Sard
lemma is inductively applied to an ordered list functions f_1,...,f_k in which
the functions are extended on the level surfaces, the set of critical values
(c_1,...,c_k) for which F-c=0 is not a (d-k)-graph is a finite set. This
discrete Sard result allows to construct explicit graphs triangulating a given
algebraic set. We also look at a second setup: for a function F from the vertex
set to R^k, we give conditions for which the simultaneous discrete algebraic
set { F=c } defined as the set of simplices of dimension in {k, k+1,...,n} on
which all f_i change sign, is a (d-k)-graph in the barycentric refinement of G.
This maximal rank condition is adapted from the continuum and the graph { F=c }
is a (n-k)-graph. While now, the critical values can have positive measure, we
are closer to calculus: for k=2 for example, extrema of functions f under a
constraint {g=c} happen at points, where the gradients of f and g are parallel
D f = L D g, the Lagrange equations on the discrete network. As for an
application, we illustrate eigenfunctions of geometric graphs and especially
the second eigenvector of 3-spheres, which by Courant-Fiedler has exactly two
nodal regions. The separating nodal surface of the second eigenfunction f_2
belonging to the smallest nonzero eigenvalue always appears to be a 2-sphere in
experiments if G is a 3-sphere.

for the slow neutron capture process ($s$-process) in massive stars and
contributes, together with the $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O, to the production
of neutrons for the $s$-process in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars.
However, the reaction is endothermic and competes directly with the
$^{22}$Ne($\alpha,\gamma)^{26}$Mg radiative capture. The uncertainties for both
reactions are large owing to the uncertainty in the level structure of
$^{26}$Mg near the alpha and neutron separation energies. These uncertainties
are affecting the s-process nucleosynthesis calculations in theoretical stellar
models. Indirect studies in the past have been successful in determining the
energies, $\gamma$-ray and neutron widths of the $^{26}$Mg states in the energy
region of interest. But, the high Coulomb barrier hinders a direct measurement
of the resonance strengths, which are determined by the $\alpha$-widths for
these states. The goal of the present experiments is to identify the critical
resonance states and to precisely measure the $\alpha$-widths by $\alpha$
transfer techniques . Hence, the $\alpha$-inelastic scattering and
$\alpha$-transfer measurements were performed on a solid $^{26}$Mg target and a
$^{22}$Ne gas target, respectively, using the Grand Raiden Spectrometer at
RCNP, Osaka, Japan. Six levels (E$_x$ = 10717 keV , 10822 keV, 10951 keV, 11085

reaction channels by the resonance contributions of the states at E$_x$ =
10951, 11167 and 11317 keV. The E$_x$ =11167 keV has the most appreciable
impact on the ($\alpha,\gamma$) rate and therefore plays an important role for
the prediction of the neutron production in s-process environments.

intersect all symplectic leaves transversally and symplectically. In a previous

communication, we promote that result to a normal form theorem for Poisson maps

a Poisson transversal, and our first main result states that simultaneous
normal forms exist around such transversals, for which the Poisson map becomes
transversally linear, and intertwines the normal form data of the transversals.
  Our second main result concerns symplectic integrations. We prove that a
neighborhood of a Poisson transversal is integrable exactly when the Poisson
transversal itself is integrable, and in that case we prove a normal form
theorem for the symplectic groupoid around its restriction to the Poisson

discover dynamically unstable features of a dynamical system in an experiment.
This approach feeds back only terms that depend on the difference between the
current output and the output from a fixed time T ago. Thus, any periodic orbit
of period T in the feedback controlled system is also a periodic orbit of the
uncontrolled system, independent of any modelling assumptions. It has been an
open problem whether this approach can be successful in general, that is, under
genericity conditions similar to those in linear control theory
(controllability), or if there are fundamental restrictions to time-delayed
feedback control. We show that there are no restrictions in principle. This
paper proves the following: for every periodic orbit satisfying a genericity
condition slightly stronger than classical linear controllability, one can find
control gains that stabilise this orbit with extended time-delayed feedback
control. While the paper's techniques are based on linear stability analysis,
they exploit the specific properties of linearisations near autonomous periodic
orbits in nonlinear systems, and are, thus, mostly relevant for the analysis of
nonlinear experiments.

root-mean-density scaling relation can be useful when trying to match the
observed properties of a particular star. It is often assumed that this
relation is valid for p mode frequencies in rotating stars. To examine the
change in frequency with rotation and mass, we have studied oscillation
frequencies of two-dimensional uniformly rotating zero-age main sequence
stellar models in the delta Scuti mass range. We identified 370 p and g
axisymetric modes for non-rotating models and then traced the changes in their
frequencies as the rotational velocity was increased. For each mass we
considered a rotation sequence of ten models, with the largest rotation rate
being about 200 km s$^{-1}$. We constrained the models to have the same surface
shape, which can be characterized for uniform rotation by the ratio between the
polar and the equatorial radii. We find that scaling relationships exist among
the oscillation frequencies of the same mode for different masses when the
models have the same shape. For p modes, this scaling closely follows the
period root-mean-density relation found in spherical stars. The g modes also
scale between models of the same shape, with the scaling reflecting the change
in properties outside the convective core as the stellar mass increases. These
scaling relationships can be particularly useful in finding specific stellar
models to match the oscillation frequencies of individual stars.

global symmetry is implemented in the partition function. In this paper, we
systematically study TQFT of three-dimensional SPTs with unitary Abelian
symmetry (e.g., $\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\times\cdots$). In
addition to the usual multi-component $BF$ topological term at level-$1$, we
find that there are new topological terms with quantized coefficients (e.g.,
$a^1\wedge a^2\wedge d a^2$ and $a^1\wedge a^2\wedge a^3\wedge a^4$) in TQFT
actions, where $a^{1},a^2,\cdots$ are 1-form U(1) gauge fields. These
additional topological terms cannot be adiabatically turned off as long as $G$
is unbroken. By investigating symmetry transformations for the TQFT partition
function, we end up with the classification of SPTs that is consistent with the
well-known group cohomology approach. We also discuss how to gauge the global
symmetry and possible TQFT descriptions of Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theory.

$\xi^{ee}(G)=\sum_{uv\in E_G}(1/\varepsilon_G(u)+1/\varepsilon_G(v))$, where
$\varepsilon_G(v)$ is the eccentricity of the vertex $v$. In this paper we
first introduced four edge-grafting transformations to study the mathematical

The average network performance depends on the choice of the modulation index,

remnant planetary systems. Most explanations for this pollution predict a sharp
decrease in the number of polluted systems with white dwarf cooling age.
Observations do not confirm this trend, and metal pollution in old (1-5 Gyr)
white dwarfs is difficult to explain. We propose an alternative,
time-independent mechanism to produce the white dwarf pollution. The orbit of a
wide binary companion can be perturbed by Galactic tides, approaching close to
the primary star for the first time after billions of years of evolution on the
white dwarf branch. We show that such a close approach perturbs a planetary
system orbiting the white dwarf, scattering planetesimals onto star-grazing
orbits, in a manner that could pollute the white dwarf's atmosphere. Our
estimates find that this mechanism is likely to contribute to metal pollution,
alongside other mechanisms, in up to a few percent of an observed sample of
white dwarfs with wide binary companions, independent of white dwarf age. This
age independence is the key difference between this wide binary mechanism and
others mechanisms suggested in the literature to explain white dwarf pollution.
Current observational samples are not large enough to assess whether this
mechanism makes a significant contribution to the population of polluted white
dwarfs, for which better constraints on the wide binary population are
required, such as those that will be obtained in the near future with Gaia.

in hot-Jupiter atmospheric flow simulations, originally investigated by Cho et
al. (2008) and Thrastarson & Cho (2010). The flow in the lower region (~1 to 20
MPa) `dragged' to immobility and uniform temperature on a very short timescale,
as in Liu & Showman (2013), leads to effectively a complete cessation of
variability as well as sensitivity in three-dimensional (3D) simulations with
traditional primitive equations. Such momentum (Rayleigh) and thermal
(Newtonian) drags are, however, ad hoc for 3D giant planet simulations. For 3D
hot-Jupiter simulations, which typically already employ strong Newtonian drag
in the upper region, sensitivity is not quenched if only the Newtonian drag is
applied in the lower region, without the strong Rayleigh drag: in general, both
sensitivity and variability persist if the two drags are not applied
concurrently in the lower region. However, even when the drags are applied
concurrently, vertically-propagating planetary waves give rise to significant
variability in the ~0.05 to 0.5 MPa region, if the vertical resolution of the
lower region is increased (e.g. here with 1000 layers for the entire domain).
New observations on the effects of the physical setup and model convergence in
`deep' atmosphere simulations are also presented.

of strong or very strong interference. For general GIC's, many inner bounds
have been provided over the years, among of them, the Han-Kobayashi (HK)
region, is the most celebrated one. Unfortunately, the calculation of the HK
region is prohibitively complex, due to the appearance of some auxiliary random
variables, whose optimal choice is an open problem. As in other multi-user

i.i.d. (memoryless) codewords, in the sense that the symbols within each

Specifically, we take known achievable regions for the GIC, and
generalize/improve them by allowing dependency between the code symbols. For
example, we improve the state-of-the-art HK region by drawing the codewords (of
each codeword and for each user) from a first-order autoregressive moving

field induced lattice strain and the propensity for non-180o domain switching
on two closeby compositions of a high performance piezoelectric alloy
(1-x)PbTiO3-(x)BiScO3, one within the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region
exhibiting d33 of 425 pC/N and another just outside the MPB region exhibiting
d33 of 260 pC/N, unravelled that, inspite of the MPB specimen exhibiting
considerably high piezoelectric response, its lattice strain and domain
switching propensity is considerably less as compared to the non-MPB specimen.
These new experimental observations contradict the commonly held view that
anomalous piezoelectric response in MPB based piezoelectrics arise due to
enhanced propensity for domain switching. Our results show the dominant
mechanism contributing to the anomalous piezo-response is field induced
interferroelectric transformation.

In general, the minimum uncertainty of an observable can depend on the

$\beta$-relaxation process, appears in glass formers. It involves all parts of
the molecule and is particularly important in glassy systems because of its
very close relationship with the $\alpha$-relaxation process. However, the
absence of a J-G $\beta$-relaxation mode in colloidal glasses raises questions
regarding its universality. In the present work, we study the microscopic
relaxation processes in Laponite suspensions, a model soft glassy material, by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. $\alpha$ and $\beta$-relaxation
timescales are estimated from the autocorrelation functions obtained by DLS
measurements for Laponite suspensions with different concentrations, salt
concentrations and temperatures. Our experimental results suggest that the
$\beta$-relaxation process in Laponite suspensions involves all parts of the
constituent Laponite particle. The ergodicity breaking time is also seen to be
correlated with the characteristic time of the $\beta$-relaxation process for
all Laponite concentrations, salt concentrations and temperatures. The width of
the primary relaxation process is observed to be correlated with the secondary
relaxation time. The secondary relaxation time is also very sensitive to the
concentration of Laponite. We measure primitive relaxation timescales from the
$\alpha$-relaxation time and the stretching exponent ($\beta$) by applying the
coupling model for highly correlated systems. The order of magnitude of the
primitive relaxation time is very close to the secondary relaxation time. These
observations indicate the presence of a J-G $\beta$-relaxation mode for soft
colloidal suspensions of Laponite.

at SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada. It reuses the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
detector, consisting of a 12m diameter acrylic vessel which will be filled with
about 780 tonnes of ultra-pure liquid scintillator. Designed as a multipurpose
neutrino experiment, the primary goal of SNO+ is a search for the neutrinoless
double-beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) of 130Te. In Phase I, the detector will be
loaded with 0.3% natural tellurium, corresponding to nearly 800 kg of 130Te,
with an expected effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity in the region of
55-133 meV, just above the inverted mass hierarchy. Recently, the possibility
of deploying up to ten times more natural tellurium has been investigated,
which would enable SNO+ to achieve sensitivity deep into the parameter space
for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in the future. Additionally, SNO+ aims
to measure reactor antineutrino oscillations, low-energy solar neutrinos, and
geoneutrinos, to be sensitive to supernova neutrinos, and to search for exotic
physics. A first phase with the detector filled with water will begin soon,
with the scintillator phase expected to start after a few months of water data
taking. The 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Phase I is foreseen for 2017.

conversations about diabetes through the systematic analysis of 2.5 million

address three questions: (1) what themes arise in these tweets?, (2) who are
the most influential users?, (3) which type of users contribute to which
themes? We answer these questions using a mixed-methods approach, integrating
techniques from anthropology, network science and information retrieval such as
thematic coding, temporal network analysis, and community and topic detection.
Diabetes-related tweets fall within broad thematic groups: health information,
news, social interaction, and commercial. At the same time, humorous messages
and references to popular culture appear consistently, more than any other type
of tweet. We classify authors according to their temporal 'hub' and 'authority'
scores. Whereas the hub landscape is diffuse and fluid over time, top
authorities are highly persistent across time and comprise bloggers, advocacy
groups and NGOs related to diabetes, as well as for-profit entities without
specific diabetes expertise. Top authorities fall into seven interest
communities as derived from their Twitter follower network. Our findings have
implications for public health professionals and policy makers who seek to use
social media as an engagement tool and to inform policy design.

construct Fr\'echet algebras $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb D^n)$ and $\mathcal
O_q(\mathbb B^n)$ such that for $q=1$ they are isomorphic to the algebras of

which asserts that $\mathbb D^n$ and $\mathbb B^n$ are not biholomorphically
equivalent unless $n=1$. In contrast, $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb D^n)$ and $\mathcal
O_q(\mathbb B^n)$ are shown to be isomorphic for $|q|\ne 1$. Next we prove that
$\mathcal O_q(\mathbb D^n)$ is isomorphic to a quotient of J. L. Taylor's ""free

quotient of G. Popescu's ""free ball algebra"" (2006). This enables us to show
that $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb D^n)$ and $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb B^n)$ yield strict
deformation quantizations (in Rieffel's sense) of $\mathcal O(\mathbb D^n)$ and
$\mathcal O(\mathbb B^n)$, respectively. Finally, we study relations between

execution to worker processors through the Internet. We model the workers
decision of whether to comply (compute the task) or not (return a bogus result
to save the computation cost) as a mixed extension of a strategic game among
workers. That is, we assume that workers are rational in a game-theoretic
sense, and that they randomize their strategic choice. Workers are assigned
multiple tasks in subsequent rounds. We model the system as an infinitely
repeated game of the mixed extension of the strategic game. In each round, the
master decides stochastically whether to accept the answer of the majority or
verify the answers received, at some cost. Incentives and/or penalties are
applied to workers accordingly. Under the above framework, we study the
conditions in which the master can reliably obtain tasks results, exploiting
that the repeated games model captures the effect of long-term interaction.
That is, workers take into account that their behavior in one computation will
have an effect on the behavior of other workers in the future. Indeed, should a
worker be found to deviate from some agreed strategic choice, the remaining
workers would change their own strategy to penalize the deviator. Hence, being
rational, workers do not deviate. We identify analytically the parameter
conditions to induce a desired worker behavior, and we evaluate experi-
mentally the mechanisms derived from such conditions. We also compare the
performance of our mechanisms with a previously known multi-round mechanism
based on reinforcement learning.

resonators has been to apply the bias through a symmetry point in such a way
that it appears as an open circuit for certain frequencies. Here, we introduce
a microwave coupler for superconducting CPW cavities in the form of a large
shunt capacitance to ground. Such a coupler acts as a broadband mirror for
microwaves while providing galvanic connection to the center conductor of the
resonator. We demonstrate this approach with a two-port
$\lambda/4$-transmission resonator with linewidths in the MHz regime
($Q\sim10^3$) that shows no spurious resonances and apply a voltage bias up to
$80$ V without affecting the quality factor of the resonator. This resonator
coupling architecture, which is simple to engineer, fabricate and analyse,
could have many potential applications in experiments involving superconducting
hybrid circuits.

applied loads. It has been widely studied for, e.g., construction materials,
but much less has been done on soft materials. Here, we characterize the
fatigue dynamics of a colloidal gel. Fatigue is induced by large amplitude
oscillatory stress (LAOStress), and the local displacements of the gel are
measured through high-frequency ultrasonic imaging. We show that fatigue
eventually leads to rupture and fluidization. We evidence four successive steps
associated with these dynamics: (i) the gel first remains solid, (ii) it then
slides against the walls, (iii) the bulk of the sample becomes heterogeneous
and displays solid-fluid coexistence, and (iv) it is finally fully fluidized.
It is possible to homogeneously scale the duration of each step with respect to
the stress oscillation amplitude $\sigma_0$. The data are compatible with both
exponential and power-law scalings with $\sigma_0$, which hints at two possible
interpretations in terms of delayed yielding in terms activated processes or of
the Basquin law. Surprisingly, we find that the model parameters behave
nonmonotonically as we change the oscillation frequency and/or the gel
concentration.

Newton-Raphson method. The non-convex structure is addressed by initializing
the learning rule based on 1) location estimates, and 2) a newly developed

There the scaling was related to the existence of a Kelvin-wave cascade which

alternative explanation that does not involve the Kelvin-wave cascade but is
due to the sharp cusp generated by a reconnection event in a situation where
the maximum curvature is limited by the computational resolution. We also
suggest a method for identifying the Kelvin spectrum based on the decay of the
rms curvature by mutual friction. Our vortex filament simulation calculations
show that the spectrum of Kelvin waves after the reconnection is not simply
$n(k) \propto k^{-\eta}$ with constant $\eta$. At large scales the spectrum

distribution in a $d-$dimensional unit cube ($d\ge 2$). The sensors have
identical sensing range equal to $r$, for some $r >0$. We are interested in
moving the sensors from their initial positions to new positions so as to
ensure that the $d-$dimensional unit cube is completely covered, i.e., every
point in the $d-$dimensional cube is within the range of a sensor. If the
$i$-th sensor is displaced a distance $d_i$, what is a displacement of minimum
cost? As cost measure for the displacement of the team of sensors we consider
the $a$-total movement defined as the sum $M_a:= \sum_{i=1}^n d_i^a$, for some
constant $a>0$. We assume that $r$ and $n$ are chosen so as to allow full
coverage of the $d-$dimensional unit cube and $a > 0$.
  The main contribution of the paper is to show the existence of a tradeoff
between the $d-$dimensional cube, sensing radius and $a$-total movement. The
main results can be summarized as follows for the case of the $d-$dimensional
cube.
  If the $d-$dimensional cube sensing radius is $\frac{1}{2n^{1/d}}$ and
$n=m^d$, for some $m\in N$, then we present an algorithm that uses
$O\left(n^{1-\frac{a}{2d}}\right)$ total expected movement (see Algorithm 2 and

$\frac{3^{3/d}}{(3^{1/d}-1)(3^{1/d}-1)}\frac{1}{2n^{1/d}}$ and $n$ is a natural
number then the total expected movement is
$O\left(n^{1-\frac{a}{2d}}\left(\frac{\ln n}{n}\right)^{\frac{a}{2d}}\right)$
(see Algorithm 3 and Theorem 7).
  In addition, we simulate Algorithm 2 and discuss the results of our

In this paper, we study the problem of recovering shape images with smooth

minimizing the shape perimeter over the set of consistent binary shapes. Next,
we relax the non-convex shape constraint to transform the problem into
minimizing the total variation over consistent non-negative-valued images. We
also introduce a requirement (called reducibility) that guarantees equivalence
between the two problems. We illustrate that the reducibility property
effectively sets a requirement on the minimum sampling density. One can draw
analogy between the reducibility property and the so-called restricted isometry
property (RIP) in compressed sensing which establishes the equivalence of the
$\ell_0$ minimization with the relaxed $\ell_1$ minimization. We also evaluate

time-invariant discord. We study two qubits experiencing local dephasing with
an Ohmic class spectrum and subject to dynamical decoupling protocols. We
investigate the connection between the dynamics of both classical and quantum
correlations and the behaviour of information flow between system and
environment. Finally, we establish a set of necessary conditions for which
time-invariant discord can be created using dynamically decoupling techniques.

thermodynamic limit, such systems are known to heat up to infinite temperature
states after infinite-time evolution, irrespective of dynamical details. In the
present study, instead of considering infinitely long-time scale, we aim to
provide a framework to understand the long but finite time behavior, namely the
transient dynamics. In the analysis, we focus on the Floquet-Magnus (FM)
expansion that gives a formal expression of the effective Hamiltonian on the
system. Although in general the full series expansion is not convergent in the
thermodynamics limit, we give a clear relationship between the FM expansion and
the transient dynamics. More precisely, we rigorously show that a truncated
version of the FM expansion accurately describes the exact dynamics for a
finite-time scale. Our result reveals a reliable time scale of the validity of
the FM expansion, which can be comparable to the experimental time scale.
Furthermore, we discuss several dynamical phenomena, such as the effect of
small integrability breaking, efficient numerical simulation of periodically
driven systems, dynamical localization and thermalization. Especially on
thermalization, we discuss generic scenario of the prethermalization phenomenon
in periodically driven systems.

Non-commutative effects at high densities are also identified, the most
prominent being the existence of a minimal volume at which the gas becomes

exhibited by these systems, which in turn is a manifestation of an
infra-red/ultra violet duality in the single particle spectrum. Both
non-rotating and slowly rotating gasses are studied. Approximations are
benchmarked against exact numerical computations for the non-rotating case and
several other properties of the gas are demonstrated with numerical

distributed, nitrogen atoms may prefer to be located on one of the two
sub-lattices of graphene. It has been suggested that such a preference may
present a possible avenue to tailor the band gap of graphene whilst maintaining
its excellent electronic transport properties. Among the proposed mechanisms to
explain this effect is the suggestion that long-range inter-impurity
interactions mediated by the conduction electrons of graphene may give rise to
the asymmetry between sub-lattice occupations. Electron-mediated interactions
are known to be prevalent not only between N atoms but also between impurities
that are adsorbed to a specific location within the hexagonal structure, namely
to the top of the carbon atom. Furthermore, this interaction is known to become
more long-ranged as the dimensionality of the system is lowered. For that
reason, in this paper we investigate whether a similar sub-lattice asymmetry
appears in the case of metallic carbon nanotubes doped with Hydrogen adatoms.
Our results indicate that similar sub-lattice asymmetries are observable and
even more pronounced in small-diameter CNTs with a dilute concentration of
adsorbates, diminishing with increasing diameter or impurity concentrations.

turbulent regime, which is much more pronounced than for the well-explored
$\eta=0.71$ case, for which the ultimate regime sets in at much lower Ta. By
measuring at varying axial positions, roll structures are found for
counter-rotation while no clear coherent structures are seen for pure inner
cylinder rotation. In addition, turbulent plumes coming from the inner and
outer cylinder are investigated. For pure inner cylinder rotation, the plumes
in the radial velocity move away from the inner cylinder, while the plumes in
the azimuthal velocity mainly move away from the outer cylinder. For
counter-rotation, the mean radial flow in the roll structures strongly affects
the direction and intensity of the turbulent plumes. Furthermore, it is

refers to a relevance to context-free languages. The CFL functions tend to
behave quite differently from their corresponding context-free languages. We
extensively discuss containments, separations, and refinements among various
classes of functions obtained from the CFL functions by applying Boolean
operations, functional composition, many-one relativization, and Turing
relativization. In particular, Turing relativization helps construct a
hierarchy over the class of CFL functions. We also analyze the computational
complexity of optimization functions, which are to find optimal values of CFL
functions, and discuss their relationships to the associated languages.

the system displays properties that are similar to those of excitable systems.

TNM allows models to be constructed using an Application Programming Interface

different simulation back-ends can be applied to it. A discrete event
simulation and a network emulation back-end are implemented building on top of
open source tools. TNM is simple to create models for non technical users. The
model can be used to analyse information flows. The same model can be used for
a full network emulation. This allows real software and protocols to be tested

problem of image processing and image segmentation. For a $d$-dimensional image

Gaussian processes or finite random series priors using basis functions such as
trigonometric polynomials for 2-dimensional images and spherical harmonics for
3-dimensional images. For 2-dimensional images, we show a rescaled squared
exponential Gaussian process on $\mathbb{S}^1$ achieves four goals of
guaranteed geometric restriction, (nearly) minimax rate optimal and adaptive to
the smoothness level, convenient for joint inference and computationally
efficient. We conduct an extensive study of its reproducing kernel Hilbert

contexts. Simulations confirm excellent performance of the proposed method and
indicate its robustness under model misspecification at least under the

multiple transmitters to transmit in the same time slot with appropriately

from electronics to photonics, phononics as well as mechanics, bringing about
not only involved new physics but also potential applications in robust wave

is considered. On the basis of this connection, 4-point associators are
obtained. The Jacobiators for the product of four supersymmetric generators are
calculated. We discuss the possible physical meaning of numerical coefficients
presented on the right-hand sides of associators. The possible connection
between supersymmetry, hidden variables, and nonassociativity is discussed.

gorga, are the source of their exoticism. There are no identical patterns of
the ornaments within Batak houses and the drawings are closely related to the
way ancient Batak capture the dynamicity of the growing 'tree of life', one of
central things within their cosmology and mythology. The survey of ornaments of
Batak houses and buildings in Northern Sumatera Indonesia has made us possible
to observe the complex pattern. The fractal dimensions of the geometrical
shapes in gorga are calculated and they are conjectured into 1.5-1.6, between
the dimensional of a line and a plane. The way gorga is drawn is captured by
using some modification to the turtle geometry of L-System model, a popular
model to model the dynamics of growing plants. The result is a proposal to see
Bataknese gorga as one of traditional heritage that may enrich the studies to
the generative art.
