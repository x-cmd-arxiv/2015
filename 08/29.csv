an extraordinarily bright $\gamma$-ray outburst detected by the {\it Fermi}
Large Area Telescope in September-October 2012 when the source reached a flux
of F$_{>100~\mathrm{MeV}} =5.2\pm0.4\times10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.
At the same time the source displayed an unprecedented optical and NIR
outburst. We study the evolution of the parsec scale jet with ultra-high
angular resolution through a sequence of 80 total and polarized intensity Very
Long Baseline Array images at 43 GHz, covering the observing period from June
2007 to June 2014. We find that the $\gamma$-ray outburst is coincident with
flares at all the other frequencies and is related to the passage of a new
superluminal knot through the radio core. The powerful $\gamma$-ray emission is
associated with a change in direction of the jet, which became oriented more
closely to our line of sight ($\theta\sim$1.2$^{\circ}$) during the ejection of
the knot and the $\gamma$-ray outburst. During the flare, the optical polarized
emission displays intra-day variability and a clear clockwise rotation of
EVPAs, which we associate with the path followed by the knot as it moves along
helical magnetic field lines, although a random walk of the EVPA caused by a
turbulent magnetic field cannot be ruled out. We locate the $\gamma$-ray
outburst a short distance downstream of the radio core, parsecs from the black
hole. This suggests that synchrotron self-Compton scattering of near-infrared
to ultraviolet photons is the probable mechanism for the $\gamma$-ray
production.

along compact dimensions periodicity conditions with general phases are
imposed.There is a range in the space of values for the coefficient in the
boundary condition where Poincare vacuum is unstable.This range depends on the
brane location.In models with compact dimensions the stability condition is
less restrictive than for AdS bulk with trivial topology.Vacuum charge density
and components of current along non-compact dimensions vanish. VEV of the
current density along compact dimensions is a periodic function of the gauge
field flux with a period equal to the flux quantum.It is decomposed into the
boundary-free and brane-induced contributions.The asymptotic behavior of the
latter is investigated near the brane, AdS boundary and horizon.In contrast to
VEVs of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor, current density is finite
on brane and vanishes for the special case of Dirichlet boundary condition.Both
boundary-free and brane-induced contributions vanish on AdS
boundary.Brane-induced contribution vanishes on the horizon and for points near
the horizon the current is dominated by the boundary-free part.In the
near-horizon limit, the latter is connected to the corresponding quantity for a
massless field in the Minkowski bulk by a simple conformal relation.Depending
on the value of the Robin coefficient, the presence of the brane can either
increase or decrease the vacuum currents. Applications are given for a
higher-dimensional version of the Randall-Sundrum 1-brane model

increasing the speed of subways is not always beneficial and may lead to
unwanted uneven spatial distributions of accessibility. In fact, for London --

proficiency in their primary and non-primary (secondary) languages and find
that the English edition of Wikipedia displays different dynamics from the
Spanish and German editions. Users primarily editing the Spanish and German
editions make more complex edits than users who edit these editions as a second
language. In contrast, users editing the English edition as a second language
make edits that are just as complex as the edits by users who primarily edit
the English edition. In this way, English serves a special role bringing
together content written by multilinguals from many language editions.
Nonetheless, language remains a formidable hurdle to the spread of content: we
find evidence for a complexity barrier whereby editors are less likely to edit
complex content in a second language. In addition, we find that multilinguals
are less engaged and show lower levels of language proficiency in their second
languages. We also examine the topical interests of multilingual editors and
find that there is no significant difference between primary and non-primary

events which lie in both $A$ and $B$ for `disjoint reasons.' Precisely, with
${\bf n}:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $K \subset {\bf n}$, for ${\bf x} \in S$ letting
$[{\bf x}]_K=\{{\bf y} \in S: y_i = x_i, i \in K\}$, the set $A \Box B$

in general ${\bf 1}_{A \Box B} \le \max_{K \cap L = \emptyset}
\underline{f}_K({\bf x}) \underline{g}_L({\bf x})$.

shows a few low frequencies in its light and radial velocity curves, whose
origin is unclear. In this work, we check for the presence of a magnetic field

detected a clear magnetic signature in the Stokes V LSD profiles. The origin of

rotational modulation of surface spots possibly related to the presence of a
magnetic field. Consequently, HD 188774 is not a genuine hybrid {\delta}
Sct-{\gamma} Dor star, but the first known magnetic main sequence {\delta} Sct

all $\rho$ such that any $N$-free matroid $M$ with $|M|>\rho2^{r(M)}$ has
bounded critical number. In this paper, we resolve two conjectures of Geelen

$PG(t-1,2)$ is $1-3\cdot2^{-t}$. We do so by proving the following stronger
statement: if $M$ is $PG(t-1,2)$-free with $|M|>(1-3\cdot2^{-t})2^{r(M)}$, then
the critical number of $M$ is $t-1$ or $t$. Together with earlier results of
Geelen and Nelson [GN14] and Govaerts and Storme [GS06], this completes the
classification of dense $PG(t-1,2)$-free matroids.

common model helix to study the fundamentals of protein insertion and folding,
as well as helix-helix association in the membrane. Its structural properties
have been illuminated in a large number of experimental and simulation studies.
In this combined coarse-grained and atomistic simulation study, we probe the
thermodynamics of a single WALP peptide, focusing on both the insertion across
the water-membrane interface, as well as folding in both water and a membrane.
The potential of mean force characterizing the peptide's insertion into the
membrane shows qualitatively similar behavior across peptides and three force
fields. However, the Martini force field exhibits a pronounced secondary
minimum for an adsorbed interfacial state, which may even become the global
minimum---in contrast to both atomistic simulations and the alternative PLUM
force field. Even though the two coarse-grained models reproduce the free
energy of insertion of individual amino acids side chains, they both
underestimate its corresponding value for the full peptide (as compared with
atomistic simulations), hinting at cooperative physics beyond the residue
level. Folding of WALP in the two environments indicates the helix as the most
stable structure, though with different relative stabilities and chain-length
dependence.

time-reversal procedure, involving the inversion of the signs of every energy
and interaction, should produce the excitation revival. This idea,
experimentally coined in NMR, embodies the concept of the Loschmidt echo (LE).
While such an implementation involves a single spin autocorrelation $M_{1,1}$,
i.e. a local LE, theoretical efforts have focused on the study of the recovery
probability of a complete many-body state, referred here as global or many-body
LE $M_{MB}$. Here, we analyze the relation between these magnitudes, in what
concerns to their characteristic time scales and their dependence on the number
of spins $N$. We show that the global LE can be understood, to some extent, as
the simultaneous occurrence of $N$ independent local LEs, i.e. $M_{MB}\sim
\left( M_{1,1}\right) ^{N/4}$. This extensive hypothesis is exact for very
short times and confirmed numerically beyond such a regime. Furthermore, we
discuss a general picture of the decay of $M_{1,1}$ as a consequence of the
interplay between the time scale that characterizes the reversible interactions
($T_{2}$) and that of the perturbation ($\tau _{\Sigma }$). Our analysis
suggests that the short time decay, characterized by the time scale $\tau
_{\Sigma }$, is greatly enhanced by the complex processes that occur beyond
$T_{2}$ . This would ultimately lead to the experimentally observed $T_{3},$
which was found to be roughly independent of $\tau _{\Sigma }$ but closely tied
to $T_{2}$.

MBLT, starting with mapping to a Brownian motion process that analytically
relates the spectral properties to the statistics of matrix elements. We
demonstrate that the flow from Wigner-Dyson to Poisson statistics is a
two-stage process. First, fractal enhancement of matrix elements upon
approaching the MBLT from the metallic side produces an effective power-law
interaction between energy levels, and leads to a plasma model for level
statistics. At the second stage, the gas of eigenvalues has local interaction
and level statistics belongs to a semi-Poisson universality class. We verify
our findings numerically on the XXZ spin chain. We provide a microscopic
understanding of the level statistics across the MBLT and discuss implications
for the transition that are strong constraints on possible theories.

  First, we improve on results of Hurlbert, who introduced a linear

strengthen this lower bound to $2n - 5$, which is best possible. Further, we

Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS), which
effectively provides a sample selected on total stellar mass, over 0.2 < z <
1.8 within the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic (SWIRE) Survey fields.
20%, or 106 clusters have spectroscopically confirmed redshifts, and the rest
have redshifts estimated from the color of their red sequence. A comparison
with the public SWIRE images detects 125 individual BCGs at 24um > 100uJy, or
23%. The luminosity-limited detection rate of BCGs in similar richness clusters
(Ngal> 12) increases rapidly with redshift. Above z ~ 1, an average of ~20\% of
the sample have 24um-inferred infrared luminosities of LIR > 10^12 Lsun, while
the fraction below z ~ 1 exhibiting such luminosities is < 1 \%. The
Spitzer-IRAC colors indicate the bulk of the 24um-detected population is
predominantly powered by star formation, with only 7/125 galaxies lying within
the color region inhabited by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Simple arguments
limit the star-formation activity to several hundred million years and this may
therefore be indicative of the timescale for AGN feedback to halt the star
formation. Below redshift z ~ 1 there is not enough star formation to
significantly contribute to the overall stellar mass of the BCG population, and
therefore BCG growth is likely dominated by dry-mergers. Above z~ 1, however,
the inferred star formation would double the stellar mass of the BCGs and is
comparable to the mass assembly predicted by simulations through dry mergers.
We cannot yet constrain the process driving the star formation for the overall
sample, though a single object studied in detail is consistent with a gas-rich
merger.

that allows an analyst to check whether queries in a stream are greater or
lesser than a threshold. This technique has a unique property -- the algorithm
works by adding noise with a finite variance to the queries and the threshold,
and guarantees privacy that only degrades with (a) the maximum sensitivity of
any one query in stream, and (b) the number of positive answers output by the
algorithm. Recent work has developed variants of this algorithm, which we call
{\em generalized private threshold testing}, and are claimed to have privacy
guarantees that do not depend on the number of positive or negative answers
output by the algorithm. These algorithms result in a significant improvement
in utility over the sparse vector technique for a given privacy budget, and
have found applications in frequent itemset mining, feature selection in
machine learning and generating synthetic data.
  In this paper we critically analyze the privacy properties of generalized
private threshold testing. We show that generalized private threshold testing
does not satisfy \epsilon-differential privacy for any finite \epsilon. We
identify a subtle error in the privacy analysis of this technique in prior

natural metric fluctuations, quantum and classical. We show that gravitons as
well as classical gravitational waves of super-horizon wavelengths are able to
form the de Sitter state of the empty homogeneous isotropic Universe. This
state is the exact solution to the self-consistent equations of one-loop
quantum gravity for gravitons in the empty FLRW space. It also is the exact
solution to the self-consistent equations of back reaction for classical
gravitational waves. Technically, to get this de Sitter solution in both
quantum and classical cases, it is necessary to make the transition to
imaginary time and then come back to real time which is possible because this
de Sitter state is invariant with respect to Wick rotation. Such a procedure
means that the time was used as a complex variable, and this fact has a deep
but still not understood meaning. De Sitter accelerated expansion of the empty
Universe naturally explains the origin of dark energy and inflation because the
Universe is empty at the start and by the end of its evolution. This theory is
consistent with the existing observational data. The CMB anisotropy of the
order of 10^-5 is produced by fluctuations in the number of gravitons. The
existence of a threshold and unique coincidence of topologically impenetrable
barriers for tunneling takes place for the matter-dominated epoch and De Sitter
State only. These facts provide a solution to the coincidence problem. The
theoretical prediction that the equation-of-state parameter should be w>-1 for
inflation and w<-1 for dark energy is consistent with observational data. To
provide the reader with a complete picture, this paper gather together new and

most elegant mechanism to explain such tiny neutrino masses is the seesaw
mechanism with right handed neutrinos. However, the required seesaw scale is so
high, $\sim 10^{14}$ GeV, it will not have any collider implications. Recently,
an explicit model has been constructed to realize the seesaw mechanism with the
right handed neutrinos at the electroweak scale. The model has a mirror
symmetry having both the left and right lepton and quark doublets and singlets
for the same $SU(2)_W $ gauge symmetry. Additional Higgs multiplets have been
introduced to realize this scenario. It turns out that these extra Higgs fields
also help to satisfy the precision electroweak tests, and other observables.
Because the scale of the symmetry breaking is electroweak, both the mirror
quark and mirror leptons have masses in the electroweak scale in the range $
\sim 150 - 800 $ GeV. The mirror quarks / leptons decay to ordinary quarks
/leptons plus very light neutral scalars. In this work, we calculate the final
state signals arising from the pair productions of these mirror quarks and
their subsequent decays. We find that these signals are well observable over
the Standard Model background for $13$ TeV LHC. Depending on the associated
Yukawa couplings, these decays can also give rise displaced vertices with long
decay length, very different from the usual displaced vertices associated with

the cosmological evolution and feedback effects of a supermassive black hole at
the center of a Milky Way-type galaxy. ErisBH shares the same initial
conditions, resolution, recipes of gas cooling, star formation and feedback, as
the close Milky Way-analog ""Eris"", but it also includes prescriptions for the
formation, growth and feedback of supermassive black holes. We find that the
galaxy's central black hole grows mainly through mergers with other black holes
coming from infalling satellite galaxies. The growth by gas accretion is
minimal because very little gas reaches the sub-kiloparsec scales. The final
black hole is, at z=0, about 2.6 million solar masses and it sits closely to
the position of SgrA* on the MBH-MBulge and MBH-sigma planes, in a location
consistent with what observed for pseudobulges. Given the limited growth due to
gas accretion, we argue that the mass of the central black hole should be above
10^5 solar masses already at z~8. The effect of AGN feedback on the host galaxy
is limited to the very central few hundreds of parsecs. Despite being weak, AGN
feedback seems to be responsible for the limited growth of the central bulge
with respect to the original Eris, which results in a significantly flatter
rotation curve in the inner few kiloparsecs. Moreover, the disk of ErisBH is
more prone to instabilities, as its bulge is smaller and its disk larger then
Eris. As a result, the disk of ErisBH undergoes a stronger dynamical evolution
relative to Eris and around z=0.3 a weak bar grows into a strong bar of a few
disk scale lengths in size. The bar triggers a burst of star formation in the
inner few hundred parsecs, provides a modest amount of new fuel to the central
black hole, and causes the bulge of ErisBH to have, by z=0, a box/peanut
morphology.(Abridged)

red-sequence galaxies M87, M49 and M60. We show how UCDs can be selected with
high completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location in
color-color diagrams ($u^*iK_s$ or $u^*gz$). Although the central galaxies in
each of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellar
masses, we find large differences in the sizes of their UCD populations, with
M87 containing ~3.5 and 7.8 times more UCDs than M49 and M60, respectively. The
relative abundance of UCDs in the three regions scales in proportion to
sub-cluster mass, as traced by X-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, number
of globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. We find that the UCDs are
predominantly blue in color, with ~85% of the UCDs having colors similar to
blue GCs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. We present evidence that UCDs
surrounding M87 and M49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by the
prominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately merging
with the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominence
correlates with distance from either galaxy. Our analysis provides evidence
that tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in the
formation of UCDs.

rates of supermassive black hole binaries and the resulting low-frequency
stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We find this GWB to be
relatively insensitive ($\lesssim10\%$) to cosmological parameters, with only
slight variation between WMAP5 and Planck cosmologies. We find that uncertainty
in the astrophysical scaling relations changes the amplitude of the GWB by a
factor of $\sim 2$. Current observational limits are already constraining this
predicted range of models. We investigate the Poisson variance in the amplitude
of the GWB for randomly-generated populations of supermassive black holes,
finding a scatter of order unity per frequency bin below 10 nHz, and increasing
to a factor of $\sim 10$ near 100 nHz. This variance is a result of the rarity
of the most massive binaries, which dominate the signal, and acts as a
fundamental uncertainty on the amplitude of the underlying power law spectrum.
This Poisson uncertainty dominates at $\gtrsim 20$ nHz, while at lower
frequencies the dominant uncertainty is related to our poor understanding of
the astrophysical scaling relations, although very low frequencies may be
dominated by uncertainties related to the final parsec problem and the
processes which drive binaries to the gravitational wave dominated regime.
Cosmological effects are negligible at all frequencies.

synergy between diffusive transport and stimulated emission can lead to lasing
action. Below the threshold pump power, the emission spectrum is smooth and
consistent from shot-to-shot. Above the lasing threshold, the spectrum of
emitted light becomes spiky and shows strong fluctuations from shot-to-shot.
Recent experiments have reported that emitted intensity resembles a power-law
distribution (\emph{i.e.} L\'evy statistics). Recent theories have described
the emergence of L\'evy statistics as an intrinsic property of lasing in random
media. To separate intrinsic intensity fluctuations from the motion of
scatterers, we compare the statistics of samples with stationary or
freely-diffusing scatterers. Consistent with previous reports, we observe
L\'evy-like statistics when intensity data are pooled across an ensemble of
scatterer configurations. For fixed scatterers, we find exponential intensity
distributions whose mean intensities vary widely across wavelengths.
L\'evy-like statistics re-emerges when data are combined across many lasing
modes. Additionally, we find strong correlations of lasing peak intensities
across wavelengths. A simple mean-field statistical model captures the observed
one- and two-point statistics, where correlations in emission intensity arise
from competition among all lasing modes for limited gain.

blazars characterized by a spectral energy distribution (SED) with a
lower-energy synchrotron peak than the majority of extragalactic sources
detected by ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs).
Consequently, the peak gamma-ray flux falls outside the very-high-energy regime
(VHE, >100 GeV) covered by IACTs such as VERITAS, making IBLs difficult to
detect except during infrequent episodes of elevated flux. However, the study
of these sources in a low-flux state is essential for developing a complete
understanding of the blazar paradigm. We present the results of VHE analyses of
long-term low-flux-state observations completed for two IBL sources: 3C 66A and
W Comae. For both sources, data from VERITAS were analyzed for the VHE regime.
The study of 3C 66A extends from 2007 to 2015, resulting in a 12 standard
deviation ($\sigma$) detection from $\sim$61 observing hours. Analysis of W
Comae from 2010 to 2014, totaling $\sim$39 hours, resulted in a 6$\sigma$

describe contemporaneous multiwavelength data to be used in further analyses.

environments to variations of electron-capture rates on medium-heavy nuclei has
been developed. With this library, the sensitivity of the core-collapse and
early post-bounce phases of core-collapse supernovae to nuclear
electron-capture is examined by systematically and statistically varying
electron-capture rates of individual nuclei. The rates are adjusted by factors
consistent with uncertainties indicated by comparing theoretical rates to those
deduced from charge-exchange and $\beta$-decay measurements. To ensure a model
independent assessment, sensitivity studies across a comprehensive set of
progenitors and equations of state are performed. In our systematic study, we
find a +16/-4 % range in the mass of the inner-core at the time of shock
formation and a $\pm$20% range of peak {\nu}e-luminosity during the
deleptonization burst. These ranges are each five times as large as those seen
from a separate progenitor study in which we evaluated the sensitivity of these
parameters to 32 presupernova stellar models. It is also found that the
simulations are more sensitive to a reduction in the electron-capture rates
than an enhancement, and in particular to the reduction in the rates for
neutron-rich nuclei near the N = 50 closed neutron-shell. As measurements for
medium-heavy (A > 65) and neutron-rich nuclei are sparse, and because accurate
theoretical models which account for nuclear structure considerations on the
individual nucleus level are not readily available, rates for these nuclei may
be overestimated. If more accurate estimates confirm this, results from this
study indicate that significant changes to the core-collapse trajectory can be
expected. For this reason, experimental and theoretical efforts should focus in
this region of the nuclear chart.

fraction of X-ray emitting gas in massive galaxy clusters. The cluster gas
fraction, believed to be a fair sample of the average baryon fraction in the
Universe, is a well-understood observable, which has previously mainly been
used to constrain background cosmology. In some modified gravity models, such
as $f(R)$ gravity, gas temperature in a massive cluster is determined by the
effective mass of that cluster, which can be larger than its true mass. On the
other hand, X-ray luminosity is determined by the true gas density, which in
both modified gravity and $\Lambda$CDM models depends mainly on $\Omega_{\rm
b}/\Omega_{\rm m}$ and hence the true total cluster mass. As a result, the
standard practice of combining gas temperatures and X-ray surface brightnesses
of clusters to infer their gas fractions can, in modified gravity models, lead
to a larger - in $f(R)$ gravity this can be $1/3$ larger - value of
$\Omega_{\rm b}/\Omega_{\rm m}$ than that inferred from other observations such
as the CMB. A quick calculation shows that the Hu-Sawicki $n=1$ $f(R)$ model
with $|\bar{f}_{R0}|=3\sim5\times10^{-5}$ is in tension with the gas fraction

depends on agents being non-strategic, i.e. that they declare their true
demands when offered goods at particular prices, or in other words, that they
are price-takers. An important question is how much the equilibria degrade in
the face of strategic behavior, i.e. what is the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of the
market viewed as a mechanism?
  Often, PoA bounds are modest constants such as 4/3 or 2. Nonetheless, in
practice a guarantee that no more than 25% or 50% of the economic value is lost
may be unappealing. This paper asks whether significantly better bounds are
possible under plausible assumptions. In particular, we look at how these worst
case guarantees improve in the following large settings.
  Large Walrasian auctions: These are auctions with many copies of each item
and many agents. We show that the PoA tends to 1 as the market size increases,
under suitable conditions, mainly that there is some uncertainty about the
numbers of copies of each good and demands obey the gross substitutes
condition. We also note that some such assumption is unavoidable.
  Large Fisher markets: Fisher markets are a class of economies that has
received considerable attention in the computer science literature. A large
market is one in which at equilibrium, each buyer makes only a small fraction
of the total purchases; the smaller the fraction, the larger the market. Here
the main condition is that demands are based on homogeneous monotone utility
functions that satisfy the gross substitutes condition. Again, the PoA tends to
1 as the market size increases.
  Furthermore, in each setting, we quantify the tradeoff between market size
and the PoA.

only ~80 keV electron ponderomotive energy. Varying laser intensity confirms
electron energies in the laser-reflection direction well above what might be

This direct, normal-incidence energy spectrum measurement is made possible by
modifying the final focusing off-axis-paraboloid (OAP) mirror with a central

(CIRS) onboard Cassini showed the lowest Saturn's ring temperatures ever
observed. Detailed radiative transfer models show that the observed equinox
temperatures of Saturn's A ring are much higher than model predictions as long
as only the flux from Saturn is taken into account. This indicates that the A
ring was not completely cooled down at the equinox. We develop a simple
seasonal model for ring temperatures and first assume that the internal density
and the thermal inertia of a ring particle are uniform with depth. The particle
size is estimated to be 1-2 m. The seasonal thermal inertia is found to be
30-50 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ in the middle A ring whereas it is $\sim$ 10
Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ or as low as the diurnal thermal inertia in the
inner and outermost regions of the A ring. An additional internal structure
model, in which a particle has a high density core surrounded by a fluffy
regolith mantle, shows that the core radius relative to the particle radius is
about 0.9 for the middle A ring and is much less for the inner and outer
regions of the A ring. This means that the radial variation of the internal
density of ring particles exists across the A ring. Some mechanisms may be
confining dense particles in the middle A ring against viscous diffusion.
Alternatively, the (middle) A ring might have recently formed ($<$ 10$^{8}$ yr)
by destruction of an icy satellite, so that dense particles have not yet
diffused over the A ring and regolith mantles of particles have not grown
thick. Our model results also indicate that the composition of the core is

electronic conduction and enhanced magnetization. To date, however, ordered

on orthorhombic GdScO3 (010)O substrates, and their impact on exchange coupling
to metallic ferromagnets. Nanoscale ferroelectric 180 stripe domains with {112
} domain walls were observed in films < 32 nm thick to compensate for large
depolarization fields. With increasing film thickness, we observe a domain
structure crossover from the depolarization field-driven 180 stripe nanodomains
to 71 domains determined by the elastic energy. Interestingly, these 180 domain
walls (which are typically cylindrical or meandering in nature due to a lack of
strong anisotropy associated with the energy of such walls) are found to be
highly-ordered. Additional studies of Co0.9Fe0.1/BiFeO3 heterostructures reveal
exchange bias and exchange enhancement in heterostructures based-on BiFeO3 with
180 domain walls and an absence of exchange bias in heterostructures based-on
BiFeO3 with 71 domain walls; suggesting that the 180 domain walls could be the
possible source for pinned uncompensated spins that give rise to exchange bias.
This is further confirmed by X-ray circular magnetic dichroism studies, which
demonstrate that films with predominantly 180 domain walls have larger
magnetization than those with primarily 71 domain walls. Our results could be
useful to extract the structure of domain walls and to explore domain wall

tropics than the temperate zone include greater age and area, higher
temperature and metabolic rates, and greater ecological opportunity. These
ideas make contrasting predictions about the relationship between speciation
processes and latitude, which I elaborate and evaluate. Available data suggest
that per capita speciation rates are currently highest in the temperate zone,
and that diversification rates (speciation minus extinction) are similar
between latitudes. In contrast, clades whose oldest analyzed dates precede the
Eocene thermal maximum, when the extent of the tropics was much greater than
today, tend to show highest speciation and diversification rates in the
tropics. These findings are consistent with age and area, which is alone among
hypotheses in predicting a time trend. Higher recent speciation rates in the
temperate zone than the tropics suggest an additional response to high
ecological opportunity associated with low species diversity. These broad
patterns are compelling but provide limited insights into underlying
mechanisms, arguing that studies of speciation processes along the latitudinal
gradient will be vital. Using threespine stickleback in depauperate northern
lakes as an example, I show how high ecological opportunity can lead to rapid
speciation. The results support a role for ecological opportunity in
speciation, but its importance in the evolution of the latitudinal gradient
remains uncertain. I conclude that per-capita evolutionary rates are no longer
higher in the tropics than the temperate zone. Nevertheless, the vast numbers
of species that have already accumulated in the tropics ensure that total rate
of species production remains highest there. Thus, tropical evolutionary
momentum helps to perpetuate the steep latitudinal biodiversity gradient.

we made. In contrast, with f-OFDM, the assigned bandwidth is split up into
several subbands, and different types of services are accommodated in different
subbands with the most suitable waveform and numerology, leading to an improved
spectrum utilization. After outlining the general framework of f-OFDM, several
important design aspects are also discussed, including filter design and guard
tone arrangement. In addition, an extensive comparison among the existing 5G
waveform candidates is also included to illustrate the advantages of f-OFDM.
Our simulations indicate that, in a specific scenario with four distinct types
of services, f-OFDM provides up to 46% of throughput gains over the

  with IM/DD","need to be further improved and revised",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Besides atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors which cause the signal
intensity fluctuation, background radiation also impairs the free-space optical
intensity-modulation / direct-detection link performance by introducing a noisy
photocurrent component in the receiver. Methods such as adopting some specific
optics systems, using pilot symbols or line codes to estimate the background
information and cancel it accordingly, and pulse-position modulation (PPM), can
be adopted to mitigate the impact of background radiation. However, purely
depending on the optics system, the background radiation can only be reduced,
but not completely cancelled; and the use of any of pilot symbols, line codes
and PPM reduces the system spectral efficiency drastically. In this paper,
based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) principle, we develop a
Viterbi-type trellis-search sequence receiver (the GLRT sequence receiver) that
can estimate the unknown channel gain and the background radiation
simultaneously, and detect the data sequence accordingly. This receiver
requires very few pilot symbols, and therefore, does not significantly reduce
the bandwidth efficiency. Its error performance can approach that of detection
with perfect information of the channel state and the background radiation, as
the observation window length used for forming the decision metric increases.
Since a Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm is adopted, the search complexity
is very low and is independent of the observation window size. However, the
search complexity of the GLRT sequence receiver grows exponentially with the
modulation order. To further simplify the implementation, we derive a more
efficient decision-feedback symbol-by-symbol receiver which retains the same
error performance as that of the GLRT sequence receiver.

$3-CA(n,H, \prod_{i=1}^{k}g_{i})$, is a $k\times n$ array such that row $i$
corresponds to vertex $v_i$, entries in row $i$ are from $Z_{g_i}$; and if
$\{v_x,v_y,v_z\}$ is a hyperedge in $H$, then the rows $x,y,z$ are
3-qualitatively independent. The parameter $n$ is called the size of the array.
Given a weighted 3-uniform hypergraph $H$, a mixed covering array on $H$ with
minimum size is called optimal. We outline necessary background in the theory
of hypergraphs that is relevant to the study of covering arrays on hypergraphs.
In this article, we introduce five basic hypergraph operations to construct
optimal mixed covering arrays on hypergraphs. Using these operations, we
provide constructions for optimal mixed covering arrays on $\alpha$-acyclic
3-uniform hypergraphs, conformal 3-uniform hypertrees having a binary tree as

is the tangential component of a three dimensional unit vector $\sigma$
corresponding to the tilt or some external macromolecules on the surface of
disk topology. The sigma model Hamiltonian is assumed for the tangential
component of $\sigma$ with the interaction coefficient $\lambda$. For large
(small) $\lambda$, the surface becomes oblong (collapsed) at relatively small
bending rigidity. For the intermediate $\lambda$, the surface becomes planar.
Conversely, fixing the surface with the boundary of area $A$ or with the two
point boundaries of distance $L$, we find that the variable $\sigma$ changes
from random to aligned state with increasing of $A$ or $L$ for the intermediate
region of $\lambda$. This implies that an internal phase transition for
$\sigma$ is triggered not only by the thermal fluctuations but also by external
mechanical forces. We also find that the frame (string) tension shows the
expected scaling behavior with respect to $A/N$ ($L/N$) at the intermediate
region of $A$ ($L$) where the $\sigma$ configuration changes between the
disordered and ordered phases. Moreover, we find that the string tension
$\gamma$ at sufficiently large $\lambda$ is considerably smaller than that at
small $\lambda$. This phenomenon resembles the so-called soft-elasticity in the
liquid crystal elastomer, which is deformed by small external tensile forces.

with the \emph{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} (IRIS) on 30 August 2014.
Initially, magnetic flux cancellation constantly took place and a filament was
activated. Then the bright material from the filament moved southward and
tracked out several fine structures. These fine structures were twisted and
tangled with each other, and appeared as a small flux rope at 1330 {\AA}, with
a total twist of about 4$\pi$. Afterwards, the flux rope underwent a
counter-clockwise (viewed top-down) unwinding motion around its axis. Spectral
observations of C {\sc ii} 1335.71 {\AA} at the southern leg of the flux rope
showed that Doppler redshifts of 6$-$24 km s$^{-1}$ appeared at the western
side of the axis, which is consistent with the counter-clockwise rotation
motion. We suggest that the magnetic flux cancellation initiates reconnection
and some activation of the flux rope. The stored twist and magnetic helicity of
the flux rope are transported into the upper atmosphere by the unwinding motion
in the late stage. The small-scale flux rope (width of 8.3$^{\prime\prime}$)
had a cylindrical shape with helical field lines, similar to the morphology of
the large-scale CME core (width of 1.54 $R_{\odot}$) on 2 June 1998. This
similarity shows the presence of flux ropes of different scales on the Sun.

formulate a template $\mathfrak{CI}$ which converts a theorem of 'pure'
Nonstandard Analysis, i.e. formulated solely with the nonstandard definitions
(of continuity, integration, differentiability, convergence, compactness, et
cetera), into the associated effective theorem. The latter constitutes a
theorem of computable mathematics no longer involving Nonstandard Analysis. To
establish the vast scope of $\mathfrak{CI}$, we apply this template to
representative theorems from the Big Five categories from Reverse Mathematics.
The latter foundational program provides a classification of the majority of
theorems from 'ordinary', that is non-set theoretical, mathematics into the
aforementioned five categories. The Reverse Mathematics zoo gathers exceptions
to this classification, and is studied in [70,71] using $\mathfrak{CI}$. Hence,
the template $\mathfrak{CI}$ is seen to apply to essentially all of ordinary
mathematics, thanks to the Big Five classification (and associated zoo) from
Reverse Mathematics. Finally, we establish that certain 'highly constructive'
theorems, called Herbrandisations, imply the original theorem of Nonstandard
Analysis from which they were obtained via $\mathfrak{CI}$.

Koiter's rules, the presented scheme a priori detects a position of the unknown
stress tensor on the yield surface even if the constitutive solution cannot be

enables to analyze properties of the constitutive operator, and simplifies
construction of the consistent tangent operator which is important for the
semismooth Newton method applied on the incremental boundary value
elastoplastic problem. The incremental problem in Mohr-Coulomb plasticity is
combined with the limit load analysis. Beside a conventional direct method of
the incremental limit analysis, a recent indirect one is introduced and its
advantages are described. The paper contains 2D and 3D numerical experiments on

high energy (VHE; 100 GeV to 100 TeV) gamma rays from young and middle-aged
SNRs. However, the interpretation of the gamma-ray observations is not unique.
This is due to the fact that gamma rays can be produced by electrons through
non-thermal Bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering, and by protons
through proton-proton collisions and subsequent neutral pion decay. To
disentangle and quantify the contributions of electrons and protons to the
gamma-ray flux, it is necessary to measure precisely the spectra and morphology
of SNRs over a broad range of gamma-ray energies. Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is one
such young SNR ( 350 years) which is bright in radio and X-rays. It has been

such as fuzzy numbers, fuzzy star-shaped numbers with respect to the origin,
fuzzy star-shaped numbers, and the general fuzzy star-shaped numbers introduced

fuzzy sets spaces endowed with $L_p$ metric whose universe sets are the former
three kinds of common fuzzy sets respectively. Constructing completions of
fuzzy sets spaces with respect to $L_p$ metric is a problem which is closely

radial basis function is applied for solving Volterras population model. The
method reduces the solution of this problem to the solution of a system of
algebraic equations. Volterras model is a non-linear integro-differential
equation where the integral term represents the effect of toxin. To solve the
problem, we use the well-known CSRBF: Wendland3,5. Numerical results and
residual norm 2 show good accuracy and rate of convergence.

radial basis function collocation for obtaining the numerical solution of
unsteady gas equation. The unsteady gas equation is a second order non-linear
two-point boundary value ordinary differential equation on the semi-infinite
domain, with a boundary condition in the infinite. The compactly supported
radial basis function collocation method reduces the solution of the equation
to the solution of a system of algebraic equation. also, we compare the results
of this work with some results. It is found that our results agree well with
those by the numerical method, which verifies the validity of the present work

solving some well- known classes of astrophysics problems categorized as

collocation points, we use the compactly supported radial basis function
through the integral operations. Afterwards, some special cases of the equation
are presented as test examples to show the reliability of the method. Then we
compare the results of this work with some results and show that the new method
is efficient and applicable
