contributions at the macrolevel of both smooth geometrical changes and
non-smooth geometrical changes (disarrangements) at submacroscopic levels. For
each (first-order) structured deformation $(g,G)$ of a continuous body, the
tensor field $G$ is known to be a measure of deformations without
disarrangements, and $M:=\nabla g-G$ is known to be a measure of deformations
due to disarrangements. The tensor fields $G$ and $M$ together deliver not only
standard notions of plastic deformation, but $M$ and its curl deliver the
Burgers vector field associated with closed curves in the body and the
dislocation density field used in describing geometrical changes in bodies with
defects. Recently, Owen and Paroni [13] evaluated explicitly some relaxed
energy densities arising in Choksi and Fonseca's energetics of structured
deformations [4] and thereby showed: (1) $(trM)^{+}$, the positive part of
$trM$, is a volume density of disarrangements due to submacroscopic
separations, (2) $(trM)^{-}$, the negative part of $trM$, is a volume density
of disarrangements due to submacroscopic switches and interpenetrations, and
(3) $|trM|$, the absolute value of $trM$, is a volume density of all three of
these non-tangential disarrangements: separations, switches, and
interpenetrations. The main contribution of the present research is to show
that a different approach to the energetics of structured deformations, that
due to Ba\'ia, Matias, and Santos [1], confirms the roles of $(trM)^{+}$,
$(trM)^{-}$, and $|trM|$ established by Owen and Paroni. In doing so, we give
an alternative, shorter proof of Owen and Paroni's results, and we establish
additional explicit formulas for other measures of disarrangements.

influencers to effectively reach a large audience. Our recent results and
observations demonstrate that the shape and identity of this elite, especially
those contributing \emph{original} content, is difficult to predict.
Information acquisition is often cited as an example of a public good. However,
this emerging and powerful theory has yet to provably offer qualitative
insights on how specialization of users into active and passive participants
occurs.
  This paper bridges, for the first time, the theory of public goods and the
analysis of diffusion in social media. We introduce a non-linear model of
\emph{perishable} public goods, leveraging new observations about sharing of
media sources. The primary contribution of this work is to show that
\emph{shelf time}, which characterizes the rate at which content get renewed,
is a critical factor in audience participation. Our model proves a fundamental
\emph{dichotomy} in information diffusion: While short-lived content has simple
and predictable diffusion, long-lived content has complex specialization. This
occurs even when all information seekers are \emph{ex ante} identical and could
be a contributing factor to the difficulty of predicting social network
participation and evolution.

body due to YORP spin-up. On the assumption that the distribution of materials
in the body is homogeneous, failed regions first appearing in the body at
different spin rates are predicted by comparing the yield condition of an
elastic stress in the body. It is found that as the spin rate increases, the
locations of the failed regions move from the equatorial surface to the central
region. To avoid such failure modes, the body should have higher cohesive
strength. The results by this model are consistent with those by a plastic
finite element model. Then, this model and a two-layered-cohesive model first
proposed by Hirabayashi et al. are used to classify possible evolution and
disruption of a spherical body. There are three possible pathways to
disruption. First, because of a strong structure, failure of the central region
is dominant and eventually leads to a breakup into multiple components. Second,
a weak surface and a weak interior make the body oblate. Third, a strong
internal core prevents the body from failing and only allows surface shedding.
This implies that observed failure modes may highly depend on the internal
structure of an asteroid, which could provide crucial information for giving
constraints on the physical properties.

applications including laser cooling of atoms and molecules, optical
magnetometry, light storage and highly precise atomic clocks. Extending CPT
methods to individual solid-state quantum systems has been only achieved in
cryogenic environments for electron spin impurities and superconducting
circuits. Here, we demonstrate efficient CPT of a single nuclear spin in a room
temperature solid. To this end, we make use of a three-level system with a
$\Lambda$-configuration in the microwave domain, which consists of nuclear spin
states addressed through their hyperfine coupling to the electron spin of a
single nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Dark state pumping requires a
relaxation mechanism which, in atomic systems, is simply provided by
spontaneous emission. In this work, the relaxation process is externally
controlled through incoherent optical pumping and separated in time from
consecutive coherent microwave excitations of the nuclear spin
$\Lambda$-system. Such a pumping scheme with controlled relaxation allows us
(i) to monitor the sequential accumulation of population into the dark state
and (ii) to reach a new regime of CPT dynamics for which periodic arrays of
dark resonances can be observed, owing to multiple constructive interferences.
This work offers new prospects for quantum state preparation, information
storage in hybrid quantum systems and metrology.

literature, a large part of which relies on a criterion proposed by Fontes,
Isopi, Newman and Ravishankar (2004). One of their convergence condition,
called (B2), states that the probability of the event that there exists three
distinct paths for a time interval of length $t(>0)$, all starting within a
segment of length $\varepsilon$, is of small order of $\varepsilon$. This
condition is often verified by applying an FKG type correlation inequality
together with a coalescing time tail estimate for two paths. For many models
where paths have complex interactions, it is hard to establish FKG type
inequalities. In this article, we show that for a non-crossing path model, with
certain assumptions, a suitable upper bound on expected first collision time
among three paths can be obtained directly using Lyapunov functions. This, in
turn, provides an alternate verification of Condition (B2). We further show
that in case of independent simple symmetric one dimensional random walks or in
case of independent Brownian motions, the expected value can be computed
explicitly. We apply this alternate method of verification of (B2) to several
models in the basin of attraction of the Brownian web studied earlier in the

larger than photometric errors and the horizontal branch (HB) luminosity

different reddening free and metal independent Period-Wesenheit relations we
provide a new distance estimate $\mu$=19.62 mag ($\sigma_{\mu}$=0.04 mag) that
agrees well with literature estimates. We constrained the metallicity
distribution of the old population, using the $M_I$ Period-Luminosity relation,

narrower than suggested by low and intermediate spectroscopy of RGBs

distance. The HB in the innermost regions is dominated by red HB stars and by
RRLs, consistent with a more metal-rich population, while in the outermost

dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the
excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and
activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It
remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks
that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in
working memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single
neurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be
maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network
architecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network,
the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous
set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a
continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives
diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the
stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion
induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which
differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We
calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the
system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with
suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can
sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by
several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.

advanced viewpoint, essentially based on the orthomodular lattice of elementary
propositions, discussing some fundamental ideas, mathematical tools and
theorems also related to the representation of physical symmetries. The final
step consists of an elementary introduction the so-called (C*-) algebraic
formulation of quantum theories.

would be anti-correlated with those of $p_T^{\ell}$ based measurements by ATLAS

from the $p_T^{\ell}$ distribution. Considering PDF uncertainties, this average
is a factor of 1.3 more precise than an average of ATLAS and CMS alone. Despite
the relatively low rate of $W$ production in LHCb, we estimate that with the
Run-II dataset, a measurement could be performed with sufficient experimental
precision to exploit this anti-correlation in PDF uncertainties. The modelling
of the lepton-pair transverse momentum distribution in the neutral current
Drell-Yan process could be a limiting factor of this measurement and will

Friedmann-Keller hierarchy emerges from the property that the system of

possess a unique general solution, even when the complete infinite system is
formally considered. That is, even when imposing a sufficient number of initial
conditions to this infinite system, it still does not provide a unique
solution. This finding is supported by a Lie-group invariance analysis, in that
the imposed example analogous to the Friedmann-Keller hierarchy admits an
unclosed Lie algebra which allows for infinitely many functionally different
equivalence transformations which all can be made compatible with any
specifically chosen initial condition. Hence, if no prior modelling assumptions
are made to close the Friedmann-Keller system of equations, the existence of an
invariant solution within such a forward recursively defined system is then
without value, since it just represents an arbitrary solution among infinitely
many other, equally privileged invariant solutions.

the space dependence of the correlators, the novel aspect is that although one
considers systems with periodic boundary conditions, the observables are
described by boundary operators. From our experience with equilibrium problems
one would have expected bulk operators. Boundary operators have correlators
having critical exponents being half of those of bulk operators. If one studies
the space-time dependence of the two-point function, one has to consider one
boundary and one bulk operators. The Raise and Peel model has conformal
invariance as can be shown in the spin 1/2 basis of the Hamiltonian which gives
the time evolution of the system. This is an XXZ quantum chain with twisted
boundary condition and local interactions. This Hamiltonian is integrable and
the spectrum is known in the finite-size scaling limit. In the stochastic base
in which the process is defined, the Hamiltonian is not local anymore. The
mapping into an SOS model, helps to define new local operators. As a byproduct
some new properties of the SOS model are conjectured. The predictions of
conformal invariance are discussed in the new framework and compared with Monte

resulting lattice responses in the layered, Ruddlesden-Popper phases,
La1.85Sr0.15CuO4. We found that a drastically reduced Gibbs free energy for
oxygen vacancy formation near the typical growth temperature for
tensile-strained epitaxial LSCO accounts for the large oxygen
non-stoichiometry. Additionally, oxygen vacancies form preferentially in the
equatorial position of the CuO2 plane, leading to a lattice contraction, rather
than the expected expansion, observed with apical oxygen vacancies. Since
oxygen stoichiometry plays a key role in determining the physical properties of
many complex oxides, the strong strain coupling of oxygen nonstoichiometry and
the unusual structural response reported here can provide new perspectives and
understanding to the structure and property relationships of many other
functional oxide materials.

standard reconstruction. The reconstructed power spectrum is obtained by adding
specific simple 3- and 4-point statistics to the pre-reconstruction power
spectrum, making it very transparent how additional BAO information from
higher-point statistics is included in the power spectrum through the

introduce four additional reconstruction algorithms and discuss their

collective time-dependent external phase shifts, which can be related to
temperature drifts, mechanical vibrations or electromagnetic oscillations. In
contrast to decoherence, dephasing can in principle be reversed. Here, we
demonstrate in experiment and theory a method for the analysis and reduction of
the influence of dephasing noise and perturbations consisting of several
external frequencies in an electron interferometer. This technique uses the
high spatial and temporal resolution of a delay line detector to reveal and
remove dephasing perturbations by second order correlation analysis. It allows

enough to induce strong radial and vertical heating on the orbits of belt
particles. On the other hand, the presence of a giant planet close to the
debris disk, acts as a stability agent reducing the radial and vertical
heating. With enough DPs, even in the presence of a Neptune-like giant planet
some radial heating remains; this heating grows steadily, re-filling resonances
otherwise empty of cometary nuclei. Specifically for the solar system, this

around a supermassive black hole. In bright sources, such as the Seyfert 1
galaxy Mrk 335, reflection of the coronal emission off the accretion disc has
been observed. Reflection produces spectral features such as an iron emission
line, which allow for properties of the inner accretion disc and the corona to
be constrained. We perform a multi-epoch spectral analysis of all XMM-Newton,
Suzaku, and NuSTAR observations of Mrk 335, and we optimize our fitting
procedure to unveil correlations between the Eddington ratio and the spectral
parameters. We find that the disc's ionization parameter correlates strongly
with the Eddington ratio: the inner disc is more strongly ionized at higher
flux. The slope of the correlation is less steep than previously predicted.
Furthermore, the cut-off of the power-law spectrum increases in energy with the
Eddington ratio, whereas the reflection fraction exhibits a decrease. We
interpret this behaviour as geometrical changes of the corona as a function of
the accretion rate. Below ~10% of the Eddington limit, the compact and
optically thick corona is located close to the inner disc, whereas at higher
accretion rates the corona is likely optically thin and extends vertically
further away from the disc surface. Furthermore, we find a soft excess that
consists of two components. In addition to a contribution from reflection in
low ionization states, a second component is present that traces the overall
flux.

below $M_{\rm sph} \sim 10^{10}\ {\rm M}_\odot$, with a steeper, about
quadratic relation at smaller masses. We investigate the physical mechanisms
responsible for the change in slope of this relation, by comparing data with
the results of the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation MORGANA, which
already predicted such a break in its original formulation. We find that the
change of slope is mostly induced by effective stellar feedback in star-forming
bulges. The shape of the relation is instead quite insensitive to other
physical mechanisms connected to BH accretion such as disc instabilities,
galaxy mergers, Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback, or even the exact
modelling of accretion onto the BH, direct or through a reservoir of low
angular momentum gas. Our results support a scenario where most stars form in
the disc component of galaxies and are carried to bulges through mergers and
disc instabilities, while accretion onto BHs is connected to star formation in
the spheroidal component. Therefore, a model of stellar feedback that produces
stronger outflows in star-forming bulges than in discs will naturally produce a
break in the scaling relation. Our results point to a form of co-evolution
especially at lower masses, below the putative break, mainly driven by stellar
feedback rather than AGN feedback.

acquire close stellar or stellar-remnant companions. These companions are not
only gravitationally bound, they tend to hierarchically isolate from other
cluster stars through series of multibody encounters. In this paper, we study
the demographics of IMBH companions in compact star clusters through direct
$N$-body simulation. We study clusters initially composed of $10^5$ or $2\times
10^5$ stars with IMBHs of 75 and 150 solar masses, and follow their evolution
for 6-10 Gyr. A tight innermost binary pair of IMBH and stellar object rapidly
forms. The IMBH has a companion with orbital semi-major axis at least three
times tighter than the second-most bound object over 90% of the time. These
companionships have typical periods of order years and are subject to cycles of
exchange and destruction. The most frequently observed, long-lived pairings
persist for $\sim 10^7$ yr. The demographics of IMBH companions in clusters are
diverse; they include both main sequence, giant stars, and stellar remnants.
Companion objects may reveal the presence of an IMBH in a cluster in one of
several ways. Most-bound companion stars routinely suffer grazing tidal
interactions with the IMBH, offering a dynamical mechanism to produce repeated
flaring episodes like those seen in the IMBH candidate HLX-1. Stellar winds of
companion stars provide a minimum quiescent accretion rate for IMBHs, with
implications for radio searches for IMBH accretion in globular clusters.
Finally, gravitational wave inspirals of compact objects are found to occur
with promising frequency.

number of RSGs shown to have winds that are ionized from the outside in. The
fate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation
star formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014) showed that
external photoionization can stall the wind of RSGs and accumulate mass in a
dense static shell. We use 1D R-HD simulations of an externally photoionized
wind to predict the Halpha and [NII] emission arising from photoionized winds
both with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]
emission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted
synthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense
shell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities
that are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a
dense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good
tracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a
function of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when
only the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the
brightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial
velocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest
emission at zero radial velocity. Our results show that the bright nebula
surrounding W26 must be asymmetric; we suggest it is confined by external ram
pressure from the wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on
the nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar. The line ratio
strongly favours photoionization over shock ionization, and so even if the
observed nebula is pressure confined there should still be an ionization front
and a photoionization-confined shell closer to the star.

currently limited by a lack of constraints on the relative contributions of two
different formation pathways: on icy grain-surfaces and in the gas-phase. We
use archival ALMA observations of the resolved distribution of H$_2$CO emission
in the disk around the young low-mass star DM Tau to assess the relative
importance of these formation routes. The observed H$_2$CO emission has a
centrally peaked and radially broad brightness profile (extending out to 500
AU). We compare these observations with disk chemistry models with and without
grain-surface formation reactions, and find that both gas and grain-surface
chemistry are necessary to explain the spatial distribution of the emission.
Gas-phase H$_2$CO production is responsible for the observed central peak,
while grain-surface chemistry is required to reproduce the emission exterior to
the CO snowline (where H$_2$CO mainly forms through the hydrogenation of CO ice
before being non-thermally desorbed). These observations demonstrate that both
gas and grain-surface pathways contribute to the observed H$_2$CO in disks, and
that their relative contributions depend strongly on distance from the host

caused by winds from young main sequence stars. However, the progenitors of
these observed features are not well characterized and the mass-loss rates
inferred from the gas kinematics are several orders of magnitude greater than
those predicted by atomic line-driven stellar wind models. We use
magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model winds launching within turbulent
molecular clouds and explore the impact of wind properties on cloud morphology
and turbulence. We find that winds do not produce clear features in turbulent
statistics such as the Fourier spectra of density and momentum but do impact
the Fourier velocity spectrum. The density and velocity distribution functions,
especially as probed by CO spectral lines, strongly indicate the presence and
influence of winds. We show that stellar mass-loss rates for individual stars
must be $\dot m_w \gtrsim 10^{-7}$ Msun yr$^{-1}$, similar to those estimated
from observations, to reproduce shell properties. Consequently, we conclude
that B and A-type main sequence stars have mass-loss rates several orders of
magnitude larger that those predicted by models or that young stars are more
variable than expected due to magnetic activity or accretion.

revealing that the observed infall velocity is ~0.3 times smaller than the free

localization (MBL), in which disordered quantum systems can fail to thermalize
in spite of strong interactions and high excitation energy, was therefore
surprising and has attracted considerable theoretical attention. Here we
experimentally generate MBL states by applying an Ising Hamiltonian with
long-range interactions and programmably random disorder to ten spins
initialized far from equilibrium. We observe the essential signatures of MBL:
memory retention of the initial state, a Poissonian distribution of energy
level spacings, and entanglement growth in the system at long times. Our
platform can be scaled to higher numbers of spins, where detailed modeling of
MBL becomes impossible due to the complexity of representing such entangled

workhorse of the atomistic biomolecular simulations---is usually parameterized
by least-squares (LS) fitting of the point charge values to a reference
electrostatic potential, a procedure that suffers from numerical instabilities
due to the ill-conditioned nature of the LS problem. Here, to reveal the
origins of this ill-conditioning, we start with a general treatment of the
point charge fitting problem as an inverse problem, and construct an
analytically soluble model with the point charges spherically arranged
according to Lebedev quadrature naturally suited for the inverse electrostatic
problem. This analytical model is contrasted to the atom-centered point-charge
model that can be viewed as an irregular quadrature poorly suited for the
problem. This analysis shows that the numerical problems of the point charge
fitting are due to the decay of the curvatures corresponding to the
eigenvectors of LS sum Hessian matrix. In part, this ill-conditioning is
intrinsic to the problem and related to decreasing electrostatic contribution
of the higher multipole moments, that are, in the case of Lebedev grid model,
directly associated with the Hessian eigenvectors. For the atom-centered model,
this association breaks down beyond the first few eigenvectors related to the
high-curvature monopole and dipole terms; this leads to even wider spread-out
of the Hessian curvature values. Using these insights, it is possible to
alleviate the ill-conditioning of the LS point-charge fitting without
introducing external restraints and/or constraints. Also, as the analytical
Lebedev grid PC model proposed here can reproduce multipole moments up to a
given rank, it may provide a promising alternative to including explicit
multipole terms in a force field.

correctly identify subgroups of a heterogeneous population, so that specific
treatment can be given to each subgroup. In this paper, we consider the
situation with samples drawn from a population consisting of subgroups with
different means, along with certain covariates. We propose a penalized approach
for subgroup analysis based on a regression model, in which heterogeneity is
driven by unobserved latent factors and thus can be represented by using
subject-specific intercepts. We apply concave penalty functions to pairwise
differences of the intercepts. This procedure automatically divides the
observations into subgroups. We develop an alternating direction method of
multipliers algorithm with concave penalties to implement the proposed approach
and demonstrate its convergence. We also establish the theoretical properties
of our proposed estimator and determine the order requirement of the minimal
difference of signals between groups in order to recover them. These results
provide a sound basis for making statistical inference in subgroup analysis.
Our proposed method is further illustrated by simulation studies and analysis
of the Cleveland heart disease dataset.

evolution of the total Brackett-$\gamma$ luminosity is done. We concentrate on
two unsolved problems of the diffuse cloud scenario: the unphysical formation
epoch only shortly before the first detection and the too steep
Brackett-$\gamma$ light curve obtained in simulations, whereas the observations
indicate a constant Brackett-$\gamma$ luminosity between 2004 and 2013. For a

both, the observed Brackett-$\gamma$ light curve and the position-velocity
diagrams of all epochs. Assuming initial pressure equilibrium with the

Our main objective is to design a distributed control reconfiguration strategy

either remain bounded or converge to zero asymptotically, \textbf{b)} in
presence of actuator fault the output of the faulty system behaves exactly the
same as that of the healthy system, and \textbf{c)} the specified $H_{\infty}$

disturbances. The gains of the reconfigured control laws are selected first by
employing a geometric approach where a set of controllers guarantees that the
output of the faulty agent imitates that of the healthy agent and the consensus
achievement objectives are satisfied. Next, the remaining degrees of freedom in
the selection of the control law gains are used to minimize the bound on a

imperfections in the FDI module decision in correctly estimating the fault
severity as well as delays in invoking the reconfigured control laws are
investigated and a bound on the maximum tolerable estimation uncertainties and

However, the nature and origin of creep remains poorly understood, and
controversial. Here, we propose that concrete creep at RH (relative humidity) >
50%, but fixed moisture-contents (i.e., basic creep), arises from a
dissolution-precipitation mechanism, active at nanoscale grain contacts, as is
often observed in a geological context, e.g., when rocks are exposed to
sustained loads, in moist environments. Based on micro-indentation and vertical
scanning interferometry experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations carried
out on calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H's), the major binding phase in
concrete, of different compositions, we show that creep rates are well
correlated to dissolution rates - an observation which supports the
dissolution-precipitation mechanism as the origin of concrete creep. C-S-H
compositions featuring high resistance to dissolution, and hence creep are
identified - analysis of which, using topological constraint theory, indicates
that these compositions present limited relaxation modes on account of their
optimally connected (i.e., constrained) atomic networks.

instability that occurs in stellar radiative interiors in the presence of
unstable compositional gradients. Numerical simulations have been used in order
to estimate the efficiency of mixing induced by this instability. However,
fully three-dimensional (3D) computations in the parameter regime appropriate
for stellar astrophysics (i.e. low Prandtl number) are prohibitively expensive.
This raises the question of whether two-dimensional (2D) simulations could be
used instead to achieve the same goals. In this work, we address this issue by
comparing the outcome of 2D and 3D simulations of fingering convection at low
Prandtl number. We find that 2D simulations are never appropriate. However, we
also find that the required 3D computational domain does not have to be very
wide: the third dimension need only contain a minimum of two wavelengths of the
fastest-growing linearly unstable mode to capture the essentially 3D dynamics
of small-scale fingering. Narrow domains, however, should still be used with
caution since they could limit the subsequent development of any large-scale
dynamics typically associated with fingering convection.

an approach that can use the computing clusters in a distributed environment to

randomly drops out a portion of neurons in each hidden layer, for each training
case, making the remaining neurons only learn to detect features that are
generally helpful for producing the correct answer. Within our approach, we
have developed four methods to combine outcomes from each machine to form a

states. Their interactions with the impurity atom then cause a ""transport"" of
fermions from majority to minority superposition states, whose numbers can be
measured after applying another 3\pi/2 pulse. In particular, when the
interaction of one component of fermions with the impurity atom is tuned close
to a confinement-induced p-wave or higher partial-wave resonance, the resulting
conductance is shown to exhibit the Kondo signature, i.e., universal
logarithmic growth by lowering the temperature. The proposed transport
measurement will thus provide a clear evidence of the orbital Kondo effect
accessible in ultracold atom experiments and pave the way for developing new

Recently, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are emerging as a competitor.
Currently, SiPMs have advantages (e.g. lower operating voltage and tolerance to
high illumination levels) and disadvantages (e.g. higher capacitance and cross

technology has a strong potential to become superior to the PMT one in terms of

energy are hydrodynamic modes of Luttinger liquid, protected by the Lorentz
invariance of the linear dispersion. We show that beyond low energies, where
quadratic dispersion reduces the symmetry to Galilean, the main character of
the many-body excitations changes into a hierarchy: calculations of dynamic
correlation functions for fermions (without spin) show that the spectral
weights of the excitations are proportional to powers of
$\mathcal{R}^{2}/L^{2}$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a length-scale related to
interactions and $L$ is the system length. Thus only small numbers of
excitations carry the principal spectral power in representative regions on the
energy-momentum planes. We have analysed the spectral function in detail and
have shown that the first-level (strongest) excitations form a mode with
parabolic dispersion, like that of a renormalised single particle. The
second-level excitations produce a singular power-law line shape to the
first-level mode and multiple power-laws at the spectral edge. We have
illustrated crossover to Luttinger liquid at low energy by calculating the
local density of state through all energy scales: from linear to non-linear,
and to above the chemical potential energies. In order to test this model, we
have carried out experiments to measure momentum-resolved tunnelling of
electrons (fermions with spin) from/to a wire formed within a GaAs
heterostructure. We observe well-resolved spin-charge separation at low energy
with appreciable interaction strength and only a parabolic dispersion of the
first-level mode at higher energies. We find structure resembling the

invaluable source of information for cosmology, and a unique window to probe
the energy scale of inflation. Extracting such information from microwave
surveys requires disentangling between foreground emissions and the
cosmological signal, which boils down to solving a component separation
problem. Component separation techniques have been widely studied for the
recovery of CMB temperature anisotropies but quite rarely for the polarization
modes. In this case, most component separation techniques make use of
second-order statistics to discriminate between the various components. More
recent methods, which rather emphasize on the sparsity of the components in the
wavelet domain, have been shown to provide low-foreground, full-sky estimate of
the CMB temperature anisotropies. Building on sparsity, the present paper
introduces a new component separation technique dubbed PolGMCA (Polarized
Generalized Morphological Component Analysis), which refines previous work to
specifically tackle the estimation of the polarized CMB maps: i) it benefits
from a recently introduced sparsity-based mechanism to cope with partially
correlated components, ii) it builds upon estimator aggregation techniques to
further yield a better noise contamination/non-Gaussian foreground residual
trade-off. The PolGMCA algorithm is evaluated on simulations of full-sky

the finite-temperature phase transition concerning center and chiral

with three fundamental Wilson quarks by twisting quark boundary conditions in a
compact direction ($Z_3$-QCD model). We calculate the expectation value of
Polyakov loop and the chiral condensate as a function of temperature on 16^3 x
4 and 20^3 x 4 lattices along the line of constant physics realizing
$m_{PS}/m_{V}=0.70$. We find out the first-order center phase transition, where
the hysteresis of the magnitude of Polyakov loop exists depending on
thermalization processes. We show that chiral condensate decreases around the
critical temperature in a similar way to that of the standard three-flavor QCD,
as it has the hysteresis in the same range as that of Polyakov loop. We also
show that the flavor symmetry breaking due to the twisted boundary condition
gets qualitatively manifest in the high-temperature phase. These results are
consistent with the predictions based on the chiral effective model in the
literature. Our approach could provide novel insights to the nonperturbative
connection between the center and chiral properties.

attributes that cannot be measured or available in physical experiments.
Kennedy and O'Hagan \cite{kennedy2001bayesian} suggested an approach to
estimate them by using data from physical experiments and computer simulations.
A theoretical framework is given which allows us to study the issues of
parameter identifiability and estimation. We define the $L_2$-consistency for
calibration as a justification for calibration methods. It is shown that a
simplified version of the original KO method leads to asymptotically
$L_2$-inconsistent calibration. This $L_2$-inconsistency can be remedied by
modifying the original estimation procedure. A novel calibration method, called
the $L_2$ calibration, is proposed and proven to be $L_2$-consistent and enjoys
optimal convergence rate. A numerical example and some mathematical analysis
are used to illustrate the source of the $L_2$-inconsistency problem.

interactions can be described in terms of local exchange coefficients and
mapping the problem into a spin model is thus possible. For arbitrary external
confining potentials the local exchanges are given by highly non-trivial
geometric factors that depend solely on the geometry of the confinement through
the single-particle eigenstates of the external potential. To obtain accurate
effective Hamiltonians to describe such systems one needs to be able to compute
these geometric factors with high precision which is difficult due to the
computational complexity of the high-dimensional integrals involved. An
approach using the local density approximation would therefore be a most
welcome approximation due to its simplicity. Here we assess the accuracy of the
local density approximation by going beyond the simple harmonic oscillator that
has been the focus of previous studies and consider some double-wells of
current experimental interest. We find that the local density approximation
works quite well as long as the potentials resemble harmonic wells but break
down for larger barriers. In order to explore the consequences of applying the
local density approximation in a concrete setup we consider quantum state
transfer in the effective spin models that one obtains. Here we find that even
minute deviations in the local exchange coefficients between the exact and the
local density approximation can induce large deviations in the fidelity of
state transfer for four, five, and six particles.

of X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) produced by AGN. Of particular interest is
the question of whether the obscuring torus, which is required by AGN
unification models, can be observed via high-J CO cooling lines. Here we report
on the analysis of a deep Herschel-PACS observation of an extremely high J CO
transition (40-39) in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The line was not detected,
with a derived 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $2 \times
10^{-17}\,\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}$. We apply an XDR model in order to
investigate whether the upper limit constrains the properties of a molecular
torus in NGC 1068. The XDR model predicts the CO Spectral Line Energy
Distributions for various gas densities and illuminating X-ray fluxes. In our
model, the CO(40-39) upper limit is matched by gas with densities $\sim
10^{6}-10^{7}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, located at $1.6-5\,\text{pc}$ from the AGN,
with column densities of at least $10^{25}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. At such high
column densities, however, dust absorbs most of the CO(40-39) line emission at
$\lambda = 65.69\, \mu$m. Therefore, even if NGC 1068 has a molecular torus
which radiates in the CO(40-39) line, the dust can attenuate the line emission
to below the PACS detection limit. The upper limit is thus consistent with the
existence of a molecular torus in NGC 1068. In general, we expect that the
CO(40-39) is observable in only a few AGN nuclei (if at all), because of the
required high gas column density, and absorption by dust.

the neutrino mass hierarchy using an underground liquid scintillator detector.
It is located 53 km away from both Yangjiang and Taishan Nuclear Power Plants
in Guangdong, China. The experimental hall, spanning more than 50 meters, is
under a granite mountain of over 700 m overburden. Within six years of running,
the detection of reactor antineutrinos can resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy
at a confidence level of 3-4$\sigma$, and determine neutrino oscillation
parameters $\sin^2\theta_{12}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$, and $|\Delta m^2_{ee}|$ to
an accuracy of better than 1%. The JUNO detector can be also used to study
terrestrial and extra-terrestrial neutrinos and new physics beyond the Standard
Model. The central detector contains 20,000 tons liquid scintillator with an
acrylic sphere of 35 m in diameter. $\sim$17,000 508-mm diameter PMTs with high
quantum efficiency provide $\sim$75% optical coverage. The current choice of
the liquid scintillator is: linear alkyl benzene (LAB) as the solvent, plus PPO
as the scintillation fluor and a wavelength-shifter (Bis-MSB). The number of
detected photoelectrons per MeV is larger than 1,100 and the energy resolution
is expected to be 3% at 1 MeV. The calibration system is designed to deploy
multiple sources to cover the entire energy range of reactor antineutrinos, and
to achieve a full-volume position coverage inside the detector. The veto system
is used for muon detection, muon induced background study and reduction. It
consists of a Water Cherenkov detector and a Top Tracker system. The readout
system, the detector control system and the offline system insure efficient and
stable data acquisition and processing.

anyons gives a non-trivial phase, not just a possible sign change. The case of
non-abelian groups $G$ is more complicated. We outline how one could use
amplimorphisms, that is, morphisms $A \to M_n(A)$ to study the superselection
structure in that case. Finally, we give a brief overview of applications of
topologically ordered systems to the field of quantum computation.

  Auto-encoders (AE) has been widely applied in different fields of machine
learning. However, as a deep model, there are a large amount of learnable
parameters in the AE, which would cause over-fitting and slow learning speed in
practice. Many researchers have been study the intrinsic structure of AE and
showed different useful methods to regularize those parameters. In this paper,
we present a novel regularization method based on a clustering algorithm which
is able to classify the parameters into different groups. With this
regularization, parameters in a given group have approximate equivalent values
and over-fitting problem could be alleviated. Moreover, due to the competitive
behavior of clustering algorithm, this model also overcomes some intrinsic

  In this contribution, we focus on the algorithmic aspects for determining the
Cartesian prime factors of a finite, connected, directed hypergraph and present
a first polynomial time algorithm to compute its PFD. In particular, the
algorithm has time complexity $O(|E||V|r^2)$ for hypergraphs $H=(V,E)$, where
the rank $r$ is the maximum number of vertices contained in an hyperedge of
$H$. If $r$ is bounded, then this algorithm performs even in
$O(|E|\log^2(|V|))$ time. Thus, our method additionally improves also the time
complexity of PFD-algorithms designed for undirected hypergraphs that have time
complexity $O(|E||V|r^6\Delta^6)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum number of

obtained the (zero temperature) phase diagrams up to $S=2$ directly in the
thermodynamic limit thanks to infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS),

a magnetization plateau vs field and stabilized by spontaneous breaking of
point group or lattice translation symmetry(ies). The nature of such phases may

$(1-\frac{1}{9S})$th of the saturated magnetization (the latter followed by a
macroscopic magnetization jump), or fully quantum as the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$

restoration of the spin rotation $U(1)$ symmetry a finite compressibility
appears, although lattice symmetry breaking persists. For integer spin values
we also identify spin gapped phases at low enough field, such as the $S=2$

R(m,2) for 3 < m < 9 and R(3,3) [Bian et al. (2013) PRL 111, 130505]. This was
greatly celebrated as the largest experimental implementation of an adiabatic
evolution algorithm to that date. However, in that computation, more than 66%
of the qubits used were auxiliary qubits, so the sizes of the Ramsey number
Hamiltonians used were tremendously smaller than the full 128-qubit capacity of
the device used. The reason these auxiliary qubits were needed was because the
best quantum annealing devices at the time (and still now) cannot implement
multi-qubit interactions beyond 2-qubit interactions, and they are also limited
in their capacity for 2-qubit interactions. We present a method which allows
the full qubit capacity of a quantum annealing device to be used, by reducing
multi-qubit and 2-qubit interactions. With our method, the device used in the
2013 Ramsey number quantum computation could have determined R(16,2) and R(4,3)
with under 10 minutes of runtime.

  on 20th July, 2015",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The validity of the von-Neumann inequality for commuting $n$ - tuples of
$3\times 3$ matrices remains open for $n\geq 3$. We give a partial answer to
this question, which is used to obtain a necessary condition for the
Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r interpolation problem on the polydisc $\mathbb D^n.$
In the special case of $n=2$ (which follows from Ando's theorem as well), this
necessary condition is made explicit. An alternative approach to the
Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r interpolation problem, in the special case of $n=2,$
adapting a theorem of Kor\'{a}nyi and Puk\'{a}nzsky is given. As a consequence,
a class of polynomials are isolated for which a complete solution to the
Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r interpolation problem is easily obtained. A natural
generalization of the Hankel operators on the Hardy space of $H^2(\mathbb T^2)$
then becomes apparent. Many of our results remain valid for any $n\in \mathbb
N,$ however, the computations are somewhat cumbersome for $n>2$ and are
omitted. The inequality $\lim_{n\to \infty}C_2(n)\leq 2 K^\mathbb C_G$, where
$K_G^\mathbb C$ is the complex Grothendieck constant and
\[C_2(n)=\sup\big\{\|p(\boldsymbol T)\|:\|p\|_{\mathbb D^n,\infty}\leq 1,
\|\boldsymbol T\|_{\infty} \leq 1 \big\}\] is due to Varopoulos. Here the
supremum is taken over all complex polynomials $p$ in $n$ variables of degree
at most $2$ and commuting $n$ - tuples $\boldsymbol T:=(T_1,\ldots,T_n)$ of
contractions. We show that \[\lim_{n\to \infty}C_2(n)\leq \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}
K^\mathbb C_G\] obtaining a slight improvement in the inequality of Varopoulos.
We show that the normed linear space $\ell^1(n),$ $n>1,$ has no isometric
embedding into $k\times k$ complex matrices for any $k\in \mathbb N$ and
discuss several infinite dimensional operator space structures on it.

Standard Model Higgs sector is of great importance to verify the consistency of
the theory. Multi-scalar extensions as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model generically lead to unstable configurations in certain regions of
parameter space. An exact minimization of the scalar potential is rather an
impossible analytic task. To give handy analytic constraints, a specific
direction in field space has to be considered which is a simplification that
tends to miss excluded regions, however good to quickly check parameter points.
We describe a yet undescribed class of charge and color breaking minima as they
appear in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, exemplarily for the case
of non-vanishing bottom squark vacuum expectation values constraining the
combination mu Yb in a non-trivial way. Contrary to famous A-parameter bounds,
we relate the bottom Yukawa coupling with the supersymmetry breaking masses.
Another bound can be found relating soft breaking masses and mu only. The
exclusions follow from the tree-level minimization and can change dramatically
using the one-loop potential. Estimates of the lifetime of unstable
configurations show that they are either extremely short- or long-lived.

similar results, if the normalization of maximal initial energy density in most

simulations. We obtain fitting functions for models in which the dark
matter-dark energy coupling is constant. Their validity is demonstrated for all
available simulations in the redshift range $z=0-1.6$ and wave modes below
$k=10 \text{h/Mpc}$. These fitting formulas can be used to test the predictions
of the model in the non-linear regime without the need for additional
computing-intensive N-body simulations. We then use these fitting functions to
perform forecasts on the constraining power that future galaxy-redshift surveys
like Euclid will have on the coupling parameter, using the Fisher matrix method
for galaxy clustering (GC) and weak lensing (WL). We find that by using
information in the non-linear power spectrum, and combining the GC and WL
probes, we can constrain the dark matter-dark energy coupling constant squared,
$\beta^{2}$, with precision smaller than 4\% and all other cosmological

Accurate determination of the low energy band topology in DFT requires the use

coupling and the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ of Yb $4f$ electrons as large
as 7 eV. We have double-checked the DFT result with the more precise GW band

avoid band bending and quantum well confinement that have confused ARPES

definitively that YbB$_{6}$ has a topologically trivial B 2$p$-Yb 5$d$

Hinode's EUV imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS) of the atmosphere above a sunquake, and compare them to the
spectra observed in a part of the flaring region with no acoustic signature.
Evidence for the sunquake is determined using both time-distance and acoustic
holography methods, and we find that, unlike many previous sunquake detections,
the signal is rather dispersed, but that the time-distance and 6 and 7 mHz
sources converge at the same spatial location. We also see some evidence for
different evolution at different frequencies, with an earlier peak at 7 mHz
than at 6 mHz. Using spectroscopic measurements we find that in this location
at the time of the 7 mHz peak the spectral emission is significantly more
intense, shows larger velocity shifts and substantially broader profiles than
in the location with no sunquake, and that there is a good correlation between
blue-shifted, hot coronal, hard X-ray (HXR) and red-shifted chromospheric
emission, consistent with the idea of a strong downward motion driven by rapid
heating by non-thermal electrons and the formation of chromospheric shocks.
Exploiting the diagnostic potential of the Mg II triplet lines, we also find
evidence for a single, large temperature increase deep in the atmosphere,
consistent with this scenario. The time of the 6 mHz and time-distance peak
signal coincides with a secondary peak in the energy release process, but in
this case we find no evidence of HXR emission in the quake location, but very
broad spectral lines, strongly shifted to the red, indicating the possible
presence of a significant flux of downward propagating Alfven waves.

states. However, the microscopic origin of the charge-density-wave state has
been unknown so far since the many-body effects beyond the mean-field-level
approximations, called the vertex corrections, are essential. Toward solving
this problem, we employ the recently developed functional renormalization-group
method, by which we can calculate the higher-order vertex corrections in a
systematic and unbiased way with high numerical accuracy. We discover the
critical development of the $p$-orbital-density-wave ($p$-ODW) instability in
the strong-spin-fluctuation region. The obtained $p$-ODW state possesses the
key characteristics of the charge ordering pattern in Bi- and Y-based
superconductors, such as the wave vector parallel to the nearest Cu-Cu
direction, and the $d$-symmetry form factor with the antiphase correlation
between $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals in the same unit cell. In addition, from the
observation of the beautiful scaling relation between the spin susceptibility
and the $p$-ODW susceptibility, we conclude that the main driving force of the
density wave is the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex correction that becomes very
singular near the magnetic quantum-critical point.

correlation between the specific angular momentum of the galaxy and the stellar
mass. These observations provide stringent constraints for galaxy formation
models in a hierarchical clustering scenario. We aim to analyse the specific

different masses. We analyse the morphology and formation history of a sample

decomposition of the analysed systems and their progenitors. We estimate the
angular momentum content of the stellar and gaseous discs, stellar bulges and
total baryons. In agreement with recent observational findings, our simulated

\textit{$(m,n)$-colored mixed chromatic number} $\chi_{(m,n)}(G)$ of an

They showed that $\chi_{(m,n)}(G) \leq k(2m+n)^{k-1}$ where $G$ is a

comparing the results of the Bethe-Salpeter and functional
renormalization-group approaches. The former approach performs summation of
ladder diagrams in the particle-hole channel, and reproduces the results of the
Schwinger-Dyson approach for the critical interaction strength of the quantum
phase transition. The renormalization-group approach combines the effect of
different channels and allows to study the role of vertex corrections. The
critical interaction strength, which is necessary to induce the symmetry
breaking in the latter approach is found in the static approximation to be
$\alpha _{c}=e^{2}/(\epsilon v_{F})\approx 1.05$ without considering the Fermi
velocity renormalization, and $\alpha _{c}=3.7$ with accounting the
renormailzation of the Fermi velocity. The latter value is expected to be
however reduced, when the dynamic screening effects are taken into account,
yielding the critical interaction, which is comparable to the one in freely
suspended graphene. We show that the vertex corrections are crucially important

formalism in the modeling of constrained mechanical systems and electrical
networks. Due to the automatic, object-oriented generation of the equations of
motion and the resulting redundancies in the descriptor variables, DAE systems
often reach a very high order. This motivates the use of model order reduction
(MOR) techniques that capture the relevant input-output dynamics in a reduced
model of much smaller order, while satisfying the constraints and preserving
fundamental properties. Due to their particular structure, new MOR techniques
designed to work directly on the DAE are required that reduce the dynamical
part while preserving the algebraic. In this contribution, we exploit the
specific structure of index-1 systems in semi-explicit form and present two
different methods for stability-preserving MOR of DAEs. The first technique
preserves strictly dissipativity of the underlying dynamics, the second takes

believed that helicity can play a significant role in turbulent systems, e.g.,
supporting the generation of large-scale magnetic fields, but its impact on the
energy cascade to small scales has never been observed. We suggest for the
first time a generalized phenomenology for isotropic turbulence with an
arbitrary spectral distribution of the helicity. We discuss various scenarios
of direct turbulent cascades with new helicity effect, which can be interpreted
as a hindering of the spectral energy transfer. Therefore the energy is
accumulated and redistributed so that the efficiency of non-linear interactions
will be sufficient to provide a constant energy flux. We confirm our
phenomenology by high Reynolds number numerical simulations based on a shell
model of helical turbulence. The energy in our model is injected at a certain
large scale only, whereas the source of helicity is distributed over all
scales. In particular, we found that the helical bottleneck effect can appear

galaxy with a low surface brightness that has been identified in LOFAR images
at 150 MHz. By combining LOFAR data with new follow-up Westerbork observations
and archival data at higher frequencies, we investigated the source morphology
and spectral properties from 116 to 4850 MHz. By modelling the radio spectrum
we probed characteristic timescales of the radio activity. The source has a
relatively smooth, diffuse, amorphous appearance together with a very weak
central compact core which is associated with the host galaxy located at
z=0.051. From our ageing and morphological analysis it is clear that the
nuclear engine is currently switched off or, at most, active at a very low
power state. The host galaxy is currently interacting with another galaxy
located at a projected separation of 15 kpc and a radial velocity offset of 300
km/s. This interaction may have played a role in the triggering and/or shut
down of the radio jets. The spectral shape of this remnant radio galaxy differs
from the majority of the previously identified remnant sources, which show
steep or curved spectra at low to intermediate frequencies. In light of this

most intriguing topics of physics. At the early stages in the 1920s, the mere
existence of thermoelectric effects in superconductors was questioned.
Theoretical breakthrough came in the 1970s, when the generation of a measurable
thermoelectric magnetic flux in superconducting loops was predicted; however a
major crisis developed when experiments showed a gross discrepancy with the
theory. Moreover, different experiments disagreed with each other by orders of
magnitude. This led to a stalemate in bringing theory and experiment into
agreement. With this work we resolve this stalemate, thus solving this
long-standing paradox and open prospects for exploration of novel
thermoelectric phenomena and new avenues for practical applications of
superconductors.

numerical-relativity simulations for mass ratios up to 18 including spins. From
a comparison of different post-Newtonian approximants with numerical-relativity
data we select the uncalibrated SEOBNRv2 model as the most appropriate for the
purpose of constructing hybrid post-Newtonian/numerical-relativity waveforms,
and we discuss how we prepare time-domain and frequency-domain hybrid data
sets. We then use our data together with results in the literature to calibrate
simple explicit expressions for the final spin and radiated energy. Equipped
with our prediction for the final state we then develop a simple and accurate
merger-ringdown-model based on modified Lorentzians in the gravitational wave
amplitude and phase, and we discuss a simple method to represent the low
frequency signal augmenting the TaylorF2 post-Newtonian approximant with terms
corresponding to higher orders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We finally
discuss different options for modelling the small intermediate frequency regime
between inspiral and merger-ringdown. A complete phenomenological model based
on the present work is presented in a companion paper.

the hybrids. The merger-ringdown is based on a phenomenological ansatz that has
been significantly improved over previous models. The model exhibits mismatches
of typically less than 1\% against all 19 calibration hybrids, and an
additional 29 verification hybrids, which provide strong evidence that, over
the calibration region, the model is sufficiently accurate for all relevant
gravitational-wave astronomy applications with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo
detectors. Beyond the calibration region the model produces physically
reasonable results, although we recommend caution in assuming that \emph{any}
merger-ringdown waveform model is accurate outside its calibration region. As
an example, we note that an alternative non-precessing model, SEOBNRv2

mismatch errors of up to 10\% for high spins outside its calibration region. We
conclude that waveform models would benefit most from a larger number of

Journey prices can change dynamically in almost real time and also vary
geographically from one area to another in a city, a strategy known as surge
pricing. In this paper, we explore the power of the new generation of open
datasets towards understanding the impact of the new disruption technologies
that emerge in the area of public transport. With our primary goal being a more
transparent economic landscape for urban commuters, we provide a direct price
comparison between Uber and the Yellow Cab company in New York. We discover
that Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher
fares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in
occurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone
application, OpenStreetCab, that offers a personalized consultation to mobile
users on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months
after its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a
single city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the
potential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a
highlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per
taxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive
experiments to show how Uber's surge pricing is the driving factor of higher
journey prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application's
users. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber's surge pricing is
occurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction
task where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area's tendency to surge.
Using exogenous to Uber datasets we show how it is possible to estimate
customer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high
accuracy.

have periodic projected spacing of 0.18-0.26degree along the giant filament,
which is consistent well with the theoretical predictions of 0.22degree. It
indicates that the turbulence seems to dominate the fragmentation process of
the dense gaseous filament on large scale. The established 4.4 kpc distance of
the GMC and the long dense filament traced by C18O emission, together with the
rich massive star formation groups in the nearby region, suggest that G23.0-0.4

symmetry implies purely axial coupling of the Z boson to charged leptons, if
the photon is required to have purely vector coupling. The corresponding
Weinberg angle is determined by sin{\theta} = 1/2. The same SU(3) symmetry
holds for quarks as well, if the observed fractional electric quark charges are
averages of integer charges, according to the Han-Nambu scheme.

"1509.02413","Yanping Huang","Yanping Huang","Learning Efficient Representations for Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a well studied framework for solving
sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. Exact methods for
solving MDPs based on dynamic programming such as policy iteration and value
iteration are effective on small problems. In problems with a large discrete
state space or with continuous state spaces, a compact representation is
essential for providing an efficient approximation solutions to MDPs. Commonly
used approximation algorithms involving constructing basis functions for
projecting the value function onto a low dimensional subspace, and building a
factored or hierarchical graphical model to decompose the transition and reward
functions. However, hand-coding a good compact representation for a given
reinforcement learning (RL) task can be quite difficult and time consuming.
Recent approaches have attempted to automatically discover efficient
representations for RL.
  In this thesis proposal, we discuss the problems of automatically
constructing structured kernel for kernel based RL, a popular approach to
learning non-parametric approximations for value function. We explore a space
of kernel structures which are built compositionally from base kernels using a
context-free grammar. We examine a greedy algorithm for searching over the
structure space. To demonstrate how the learned structure can represent and
approximate the original RL problem in terms of compactness and efficiency, we
plan to evaluate our method on a synthetic problem and compare it to other RL
baselines.

  representatives formulation",,,,,"math.CO cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the fact that some vertex coloring problems are polynomially solvable
on certain graph classes, most of these problems are not ""under control"" from a
polyhedral point of view. The equivalence between \emph{optimization} and
\emph{polyhedral separation} suggests that, for these problems, there must
exist formulations admitting some elegant characterization for the polytopes
associated to them. Therefore, it is interesting to study known formulations
for vertex coloring with the goal of finding such characterizations. In this
work we study the asymmetric representatives formulation and we show that the
corresponding coloring polytope, for a given graph $G$, can be interpreted as
the stable set polytope of another graph obtained from $G$. This result allows
us to derive complete characterizations for the corresponding coloring polytope
for some families of graphs, based on known complete characterizations for the
stable set polytope.
