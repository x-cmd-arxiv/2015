constraining protostar formation models. VLA16234-2417 represents the prototype
of class 0 protostars, and it has been recently identified as a triple
non-coeval system. Aim: We aim at deriving the physical properties of the jets
in VLA16234-2417 using tracers of shocked gas. Methods: ALMA Cycle 0 Early
Science observations of CO(2-1) in the extended configuration are presented in
comparison with previous SMA CO(3-2) and Herschel-PACS [OI}] 63 micron
observations. Gas morphology and kinematics were analysed to constrain the
physical structure and origin of the protostellar outflows. Results: We reveal
a collimated jet component associated with the [OI] 63 micron emission at about
8'' (about 960 AU) from source B. This newly detected jet component is
inversely oriented with respect to the large-scale outflow driven by source A,
and it is aligned with compact and fast jet emission very close to source B
(about 0.3'') rather than with the direction perpendicular to the A disk. We
also detect a cavity-like structure at low projected velocities, which
surrounds the [OI] 63 micron emission and is possibly associated with the
outflow driven by source A. Finally, no compact outflow emission is associated
with source W. Conclusions: Our high-resolution ALMA observations seem to
suggest there is a fast and collimated jet component associated with source B.
This scenario would confirm that source B is younger than A, that it is in a
very early stage of evolution, and that it drives a faster, more collimated,
and more compact jet with respect to the large-scale slower outflow driven by
A. However, a different scenario of a precessing jet driven by A cannot be
firmly excluded from the present observations.

observations with the Nuclear Stereoscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), a
satellite mission launched in 2012. NuSTAR provides unprecedented sensitivity
in the hard X-ray range 3-79 keV, which, together with very high energy (VHE;
>100 GeV) observations, is crucial to probe the highest energy electrons in Mrk
501. The campaign covered a few day long flaring activity in July 2013 which
could be studied with strictly simultaneous NuSTAR and MAGIC observations. A
large fraction of the MAGIC data during this activity was affected by hazy
atmospheric conditions, due to a sand layer from the Saharan desert. These data
would have been removed in any standard Cherenkov Telescope data analysis.
MAGIC has developed a technique to correct for adverse atmospheric conditions,
making use of information from the LIDAR facility at the MAGIC site, and
applies an event-by-event correction to recover data affected by adverse
weather conditions. This is the first time that LIDAR information has been used
to produce a physics result with Cherenkov Telescope data taken during adverse
atmospheric conditions, and hence sets a precedent for current and future
ground-based gamma-ray instruments. In this contribution we report the
observational results, focusing on the LIDAR-corrected MAGIC data and the
strictly simultaneous NuSTAR and MAGIC/VERITAS data, and discuss the scientific
implications.

breathing mode exhibits features similar to the Bose-Laughlin state in having
eigenenergy, von Neumann entropy and internal structure independent of
interaction for the three-boson system considered here. On the contrary, for
eigenstates lying between the Bose-Laughlin like ground state and the first

Campbelling techniques both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results show
that the variance still remains proportional to the detection intensity, and is
thus suitable for the monitoring of the mean flux, but the calibration factor
between the variance and the detection intensity is an involved function of the

By preprocessing the network model to eliminate low-impedance lines, this paper
demonstrates the capability of the moment relaxations to globally solve large

far been computationally intractable for current formulations of the moment

of an objective function penalization with the moment relaxations. This
combination yields feasible points with objective function values that are

for incremental output feedback passivity (iOFP) of cyclic feedback systems
(CFS) has been reported, assuming that the constituent subsystems are
incrementally output strictly passive (iOSP). This criterion was used to prove
that a network of identical CFS can be synchronized under sufficiently strong
linear diffusive coupling. A very important class of CFS consists of biological
oscillators, named after Brian Goodwin and describing self-regulated chains of
enzymatic reactions, where the product of each reaction catalyzes the next
reaction, while the last product inhibits the first reaction in the chain.
Goodwin's oscillators are used, in particular, to model the dynamics of genetic
circadian pacemakers, hormonal cycles and some metabolic pathways. In this
paper we point out that for Goodwin's oscillators, where the individual
reactions have nonlinear (e.g. Mikhaelis-Menten) kinetics, the synchronization
criterion, obtained by Hamadeh et al., cannot be directly applied. This
criterion relies on the implicit assumption of the solution boundedness,
dictated also by the chemical feasibility (the state variables stand for the
concentrations of chemicals). Furthermore, to test the synchronization
condition one needs to know an explicit bound for a solution, which generally
cannot be guaranteed under linear coupling. At the same time, we show that
these restrictions can be avoided for a nonlinear synchronization protocol,
where the control inputs are ""saturated"" by a special nonlinear function
(belonging to a wide class), which guarantees nonnegativity of the solutions
and allows to get explicit ultimate bounds for them. We prove that oscillators
synchronize under such a protocol, provided that the couplings are sufficiently
strong.

Math. 59 (2015), no. 2, 449--483",,,"math.OA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given an inclusion D $\subseteq$ C of unital C*-algebras, a unital completely
positive linear map $\Phi$ of C into the injective envelope I(D) of D which
extends the inclusion of D into I(D) is a pseudo-expectation. The set
PsExp(C,D) of all pseudo-expectations is a convex set, and for abelian D, we
prove a Krein-Milman type theorem showing that PsExp(C,D) can be recovered from
its extreme points. When C is abelian, the extreme pseudo-expectations coincide
with the homomorphisms of C into I(D) which extend the inclusion of D into
I(D), and these are in bijective correspondence with the ideals of C which are
maximal with respect to having trivial intersection with D.
  Natural classes of inclusions have a unique pseudo-expectation (e.g., when D
is a regular MASA in C). Uniqueness of the pseudo-expectation implies
interesting structural properties for the inclusion. For example, when D
$\subseteq$ C $\subseteq$ B(H) are W*-algebras, uniqueness of the
pseudo-expectation implies that D' $\cap$ C is the center of D; moreover, when
H is separable and D is abelian, we characterize which W*-inclusions have the
unique pseudo-expectation property.
  For general inclusions of C*-algebras with D abelian, we characterize the
unique pseudo-expectation property in terms of order structure; and when C is
abelian, we are able to give a topological description of the unique
pseudo-expectation property.
  Applications include: a) if an inclusion D $\subseteq$ C has a unique
pseudo-expectation $\Phi$ which is also faithful, then the C*-envelope of any
operator space X with D $\subseteq$ X $\subseteq$ C is the C*-subalgebra of C
generated by X; b) for many interesting classes of C*-inclusions, having a
faithful unique pseudo-expectation implies that D norms C. We give examples to
illustrate the theory, and conclude with several unresolved questions.

Faddeev-AGS equations in a Coulomb basis avoids introducing screening of the
Coulomb force. However, momentum space partial-wave $t$-matrix elements need to
be evaluated in this basis. When those $t$-matrices are separable, the
evaluation requires the folding of a form factor, depending on one momentum
variable, with a momentum space partial-wave Coulomb function, which has a
singular behavior at the external momentum $q$. We developed an improved
regularization scheme to calculate Coulomb distorted form factors as the
integral over the Coulomb function and complex nuclear form factors.

of 152 objects with reliable AGN nature and multi-epoch X-ray data and minimal
MIR contribution from star formation. Although the sample is not homogeneous or
complete, we show that our results are unlikely to be affected by biases. The
MIR--X-ray correlation is nearly linear and within a factor of two independent
of the AGN type and the wavebands used. The observed scatter is <0.4 dex. A
possible flattening of the correlation slope at the highest luminosities probed
(~ 10^45 erg/s) is indicated but not significant. Unobscured objects have, on
average, an MIR--X-ray ratio that is only <= 0.15 dex higher than that of
obscured objects. Objects with intermediate X-ray column densities (22 < log
N_H < 23) actually show the highest MIR--X-ray ratio on average. Radio-loud
objects show a higher mean MIR--X-ray ratio at low luminosities, while the
ratio is lower than average at high luminosities. This may be explained by
synchrotron emission from the jet contributing to the MIR at low-luminosities
and additional X-ray emission at high luminosities. True Seyfert 2 candidates
and double AGN do not show any deviation from the general behaviour. Finally,
we show that the MIR--X-ray correlation can be used to verify the AGN nature of
uncertain objects. Specifically, we give equations that allow to determine the
intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities and column densities for objects with complex
X-ray properties to within 0.34 dex. These techniques are applied to the
uncertain objects of the remaining AGN MIR atlas, demonstrating the usefulness

a unique opportunity to probe the reionization era by high precision analyses

constraints on the neutral hydrogen fraction (f_HI) in intergalactic medium
(IGM) derived from spectra taken by different telescopes are in contradiction.
Here we examine the origin of this discrepancy by analyzing the spectrum taken
by VLT with our own analysis code previously used to fit the Subaru spectrum.
Though the VLT team reported no evidence for IGM HI using the VLT spectrum, we
confirmed our previous result of preferring non-zero IGM HI (the best-fit f_HI
~ 0.06, when IGM HI extends to the GRB redshift). The fit residuals of the VLT
spectrum by the model without IGM HI show the same systematic trend as the
Subaru spectrum. We consider that the likely origin of the discrepancy between
the two teams is the difference of the wavelength ranges adopted in the
fittings; our wavelength range is wider than that of the VLT team, and also we
avoided the shortest wavelength range of deep Ly alpha absorption (lambda_obs <
8426 A), because this region is dominated by HI in the host galaxy and the
systematic uncertainty about host HI velocity distribution is large. We also
study the sensitivity of these results to the adopted Ly alpha cross section
formulae, ranging from the classical Lorentzian function to the most recent one
taking into account fully quantum mechanical scattering. It is found that the
preference for non-zero IGM HI is robust against the choice of the cross
section formulae, but it is quantitatively not negligible and hence one should
be careful in future analyses.

  2015",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the problem of determining the weight distributions of
families of cyclic codes is, in general, notoriously difficult. An even harder
problem is to find characterizations of families of cyclic codes in terms of
their weight distributions. On the other hand, it is also well known that
cyclic codes with few weights have a great practical importance in coding
theory and cryptography. In particular, cyclic codes having three nonzero
weights have been studied by several authors, however, most of these efforts
focused on cyclic codes over a prime field. In this work we present a
characterization of a class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes of dimension 3
over any finite field. The codes under this characterization are, indeed,
optimal in the sense that their lengths reach the Griesmer lower bound for
linear codes. Consequently, these codes reach, simultaneously, the best
possible coding capacity, and also the best possible capabilities of error
detection and correction for linear codes. But because they are cyclic in
nature, they also possess a rich algebraic structure that can be utilized in a
variety of ways, particularly, in the design of very efficient coding and
decoding algorithms. What is also worth pointing out, is the simplicity of the
necessary and sufficient numerical conditions that characterize our class of
optimal three-weight cyclic codes. As we already pointed out, it is a hard
problem to find this kind of characterizations. However, for this particular
case the fundamental tool that allowed us to find our characterization was the
characterization for all two-weight irreducible cyclic codes that was
introduced by B. Schmidt and C. White (2002). Lastly, another feature about the
codes in this class, is that their duals seem to have always the same
parameters as the best known linear codes.

transmitter nodes that are also capable of wirelessly transferring energy to or

optimal transmit power and energy transfer policies that maximize
sum-throughput for the two-way, two-hop, and multiple access channels are
identified. It is shown for nodes with infinite-sized batteries that delaying
energy transfers until energy is needed immediately at the receiving node is
sum-throughput optimal. Focusing on such procrastinating policies without loss
of optimality, the stated joint optimization problem can be decomposed into
energy transfer and consumed energy allocation problems which are solved in
tandem. This decomposition is shown to hold for the finite-sized battery case
as well, using partially procrastinating policies that avoid battery overflows.
It is observed that for the two-hop channel, the proposed algorithm has a two

reduces to a single transmitter problem with aggregate energy arrivals.
Numerical results demonstrate the throughput improvement with bi-directional

a general analytic expression for how the atmospheric mass grows with time $t$,
as a function of the underlying core mass $M_{\rm core}$ and nebular
conditions, including the gas metallicity $Z$. Planets accrete as much gas as
can cool: an atmosphere's doubling time is given by its Kelvin-Helmholtz time.
Dusty atmospheres behave differently from atmospheres made dust-free by grain
growth and sedimentation. The gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) of a dusty
atmosphere scales as GCR $\propto t^{0.4} M_{\rm core}^{1.7} Z^{-0.4} \mu_{\rm
rcb}^{3.4}$, where $\mu_{\rm rcb} \propto 1/(1-Z)$ (for $Z$ not too close to 1)
is the mean molecular weight at the innermost radiative-convective boundary.
This scaling applies across all orbital distances and nebular conditions for
dusty atmospheres; their radiative-convective boundaries, which regulate
cooling, are not set by the external environment, but rather by the internal
microphysics of dust sublimation, H$_2$ dissociation, and the formation of
H$^-$. By contrast, dust-free atmospheres have their radiative boundaries at
temperatures $T_{\rm rcb}$ close to nebular temperatures $T_{\rm out}$, and
grow faster at larger orbital distances where cooler temperatures, and by
extension lower opacities, prevail. At 0.1 AU in a gas-poor nebula, GCR
$\propto t^{0.4} T_{\rm rcb}^{-1.9} M_{\rm core}^{1.6} Z^{-0.4} \mu_{\rm
rcb}^{3.3}$, while beyond 1 AU in a gas-rich nebula, GCR $\propto t^{0.4}
T_{\rm rcb}^{-1.5} M_{\rm core}^1 Z^{-0.4}\mu_{\rm rcb}^{2.2}$. We confirm our
analytic scalings against detailed numerical models for objects ranging in mass
from Mars (0.1 $M_\oplus$) to the most extreme super-Earths (10-20 $M_\oplus$),

models which exhibit an Anderson (single-) or many-body localized phase. This
approximation, which consists in summing over the amplitudes of only the
shortest paths in the locator expansion, is known to over-estimate the critical
value of the disorder which determines the onset of the localized phase.
Nevertheless, the results provided by the approximation become more and more
accurate as the local coordination (dimensionality) of the graph, defined by
the hopping matrix, is made larger. In this sense, the forward approximation
can be regarded as a mean field theory for the Anderson transition in infinite
dimensions. The sum can be efficiently computed using transfer matrix
techniques, and the results are compared with the most precise exact
diagonalization results available.
  For the Anderson problem, we find a critical value of the disorder which is
$0.9\%$ off the most precise available numerical value already in 5 spatial
dimensions, while for the many-body localized phase of the Heisenberg model
with random fields the critical disorder $h_c=4.0\pm 0.3$ is strikingly close
to the most recent results obtained by exact diagonalization. In both cases we
obtain a critical exponent $\nu=1$. In the Anderson case, the latter does not
show dependence on the dimensionality, as it is common within mean field
approximations.
  We discuss the relevance of the correlations between the shortest paths for
both the single- and many-body problems, and comment on the connections of our
results with the problem of directed polymers in random medium.

simulations to study the long term evolution of the collapsing gas within dark

candidate for rapid formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high
z. To circumvent the Courant condition at small radii, we have used the sink
particle method, and focus on the evolution on scales ~0.01-10 pc. The collapse
proceeds in two stages, with the secondary runaway happening within the central
10 pc, and with no detected fragmentation. The sink particles form when the
collapsing gas requires additional refinement of the grid size at the highest
refinement level. Their mass never exceeds ~10^3 Mo, with the sole exception of
the central seed which grows dramatically to ~ 2 x 10^6 Mo in ~2 Myr,
confirming the feasibility of this path to the SMBH. The time variability of
angular momentum axis in the accreted gas results in the formation of two
misaligned disks --- a small inner disk, and a more massive, outer disk which
is inclined by ~45^o to the inner disk. The self-gravity of these disks is
heavily diluted --- both disks lie within the Roche limit of the central seed.
While the inner disk is geometrically thin and weakly asymmetric, the outer
disk flares due to turbulent motions as a result of the massive inflow along a
pair of penetrating filaments. The geometry of inflow via filaments determines
the dominant and secondary Fourier modes in this disk --- these modes have a
non-self-gravitational origin. We do not confirm that m=1 is a principal mode
that drives the inflow in the presence of a central massive object. While the
positions of the disks depend on the scale chosen to break the self-similar
collapse, the overall configuration appears to be generic, and is expected to
form when the central seed becomes sufficiently massive.

deepest \emph{Herschel} surveys. Our cumulative number counts have been
determined independently at 870 $\mu$m and 1.2 mm, from a sparse sampling of
the astronomical sky, and are thus relatively free of cosmic variance. The
counts are lower than reported previously by a factor of at least $2\times$.
Future analyses will yield large, secure samples of DSFGs, with redshifts
determined via detection of submm spectral lines. Uniquely, our strategy then
allows morphological studies of very faint DSFGs - representative of more
normal star-forming galaxies than conventional submm galaxies (SMGs) - in

contribution we aim to resolve the enrichment histories of ETGs. This means we
study the abundance of Fe ([Fe/H]) and the alpha-element groups ([alpha/Fe])
separately for stars older than 9.5 Gyr ([Fe/H]o, [alpha/Fe]o) and for stars
between 1.5 and 9.5 Gyr ([Fe/H]i, [alpha/Fe]i). Through extensive simulation we
show that we can indeed recover the enrichment history per galaxy. We then
analyze a spectroscopic sample of 2286 early-type galaxies from the SDSS
selected to be ETGs. We separate out those galaxies for which the abundance of
iron in stars grows throughout the lifetime of the galaxy, i.e. in which
[Fe/H]o < [Fe/H]i. We confirm earlier work where the [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]
parameters are correlated with the mass and velocity dispersion of ETGs. We
emphasize that the strongest relation is between [alpha/Fe] and age. This
relation falls into two regimes, one with a steep slope for old galaxies and
one with a shallow slope for younger ETGs. The vast majority of ETGs in our
sample do not show the 'knee' in the plot of [Fe/H] vs. [alpha/Fe] commonly
observed in local group galaxies. This implies that for the vast majority of
ETGs, the stars younger than 9.5 Gyrs are likely to have been accreted or
formed from accreted gas. The properties of the intermediate-age stars in
accretion-dominated ETGs indicate that mass growth through late (minor) mergers
in ETGs is dominated by galaxies with low [Fe/H] and low [alpha/Fe]. The method
of reconstructing the stellar enrichment histories of ETGs introduced in this
paper promises to constrain the star formation and mass assembly histories of
large samples of galaxies in a unique way.

the high-resolution cosmological simulation MassiveBlack-II (MBII). From the
spectral energy distribution of each galaxy, we select a sub-sample of
star-forming galaxies at $0.06 \le z \le 3.0$ using the [OII] emission line
luminosity L([OII]). We confirm that the specific star formation rate matches
that in the GAMA survey. We show that the [OII] LF at z=1.0 from the MBII shows
a good agreement with the LFs from several surveys below L([OII])=$10^{43.0}$
erg/s while the low redshifts ($z \le 0.3$) show an excess in the prediction of
bright [OII] galaxies, but still displaying a good match with observations
below L([OII])=$10^{41.6}$ erg/s. Based on the validity in reproducing the
properties of [OII] galaxies at low redshift ($z \le 1$), we forecast the
evolution of the [OII] LF at high redshift ($z \le 3$), which can be tested by
upcoming surveys such as the HETDEX and DESI. The slopes of the LFs at bright
and faint ends range from -3 to -2 showing minima at z=2. The slope of the
bright end evolves approximately as 1/(z+1) at z=2 while the faint end evolves
as ~3/(z+1) at $0.6 \le z \le 2$. In addition, a similar analysis is applied
for the evolution of [OIII] LFs, which is to be explored in the forthcoming
survey WFIRST-AFTA. Finally, we show that the auto-correlation function of
[OII] and [OIII] emitting galaxies shows a rapid evolution from z=2 to 1.

and the functional form is shifted toward larger values of $\ln (1/\sigma)$. We
also find that the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the two-point

moving to smaller scales and the peak amplitude decreasing for increasing
directional cosine $\mu$ compared to the linear predictions. From the halo

has produced many eruptions. However, there exists a non-eruptive filament in
the plage region just next to an eruptive one in the AR, which gives us an
opportunity to perform a comparison analysis of these two filaments. The
coronal magnetic field extrapolated using a CESE-MHD-NLFFF code (Jiang & Feng
2013) reveals that two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) exist in the same
extrapolation box supporting these two filaments, respectively. Analysis of the
magnetic field shows that the eruptive MFR contains a bald-patch separatrix
surface (BPSS) co-spatial very well with a pre-eruptive EUV sigmoid, which is
consistent with the BPSS model for coronal sigmoids. The magnetic dips of the
non-eruptive MFRs match H{\alpha} observation of the non-eruptive filament
strikingly well, which strongly supports the MFR-dip model for filaments.
Compared with the non-eruptive MFR/filament (with a length of about 200 Mm),
the eruptive MFR/filament is much smaller (with a length of about 20 Mm), but
it contains most of the magnetic free energy in the extrapolation box and holds
a much higher free energy density than the non-eruptive one. Both the MFRs are
weakly twisted and cannot trigger kink instability. The AR eruptive MFR is
unstable because its axis reaches above a critical height for torus
instability, at which the overlying closed arcades can no longer confine the
MFR stably. On the contrary, the quiescent MFR is very firmly held by its
overlying field, as its axis apex is far below the torus-instability threshold
height. Overall, this comparison investigation supports that MFR can exist
prior to eruption and the ideal MHD instability can trigger MFR eruption.

ansae, as well as the arc-like features) and its surroundings. Thus, we
investigated the morpho-kinematical properties of NGC~3242, as well as their

structure and the distance to this nebula are in concordance with previous
studies. Furthermore, we have used the software SHAPE to construct a 3D model

conclude that the prominent knots emitting in the [N II] line are fast,
low-ionisation emission regions (FLIERs) related to high velocity jets and the
so-called ansae-like features rather resemble bubbles. The disruptions immersed
in the halo, whose emission was detected in the the [O III] high-excitation
emission line, remarkably display high velocities and were formed likely in an
earlier ejection event, in comparison to the innermost FLIERs and bubbles.
Finally, according to our model, the kinematical ages of the structures in
NGC~3242 range from 390 to 5400 yr.

freedom and their symmetry partners, it is interesting to contemplate whether
finite temperature corrections also cancel, raising the question of whether a
broken phase of electroweak symmetry may persist at high temperature. It is
well known that this does not happen in supersymmetric theories because the
thermal contributions of bosons and fermions do not cancel each other. However,
for theories with same spin partners, the answer is less obvious. Using the
Twin Higgs model as a benchmark, we show that although thermal corrections do

self-assembly behaviour affects the gas-liquid coexistence. We vary the
distance between the repulsive and the attractive lobes (bond length), and the
interaction range, and follow the evolution of the gas-liquid (GL) coexistence

shifts to lower temperatures, and that the interaction range controls the
transition between phase separation and self-assembly of clusters. Upon further
reduction of the interaction range and temperature, the clusters assume an
increasingly ordered tube-like shape, ultimately matching the one previously

scattering (QENS) in proteins. We call the model ELM for ""Energy Landscape
Model"". We postulate that the spectrum of the scattered neutrons consists of
lines of natural width shifted from the center by fluctuations. ELM is based on
two facts: Neutrons are wave packets; proteins have low-lying substates that
form the free-energy landscape (FEL). Experiments suggest that the wave packets
are a few hundred micrometers long. The interaction between the neutron and a
proton in the protein takes place during the transit of the wave packet. The
wave packet exerts the force $F(t) = dQ(t)/dt$ on the protein moiety, a part of
the protein surrounding the struck proton. $Q(t)$ is the wave vector (momentum)
transferred by the neutron wave packet to the proton during the transit. The
ensuing energy is stored in the energy landscape and returned to the neutron as
the wave packet exits. Kinetic energy thus is changed into potential energy and
back. The interaction energy is proportional to $Q$, not to $Q^2$. To develop
and check the ELM, we use published work on dehydrated proteins after reversing
improper normalizations. In such proteins only vibrations are active and the
effects caused by the neutron momentum can be studied undisturbed by external
fluctuations. ELM has predictive power. For example it quantitatively predicts
the observed inelastic incoherent fraction $S(Q, T)$ over a broad range of
temperature and momentum $Q$ with one coefficient if $S(0, T)$ is known.

separation architecture called hyper-cellular network (HCN) has been proposed,
which decouples the control signaling and data transmission functions.
Specifically, the control coverage is guaranteed by macro base stations (MBSs),
whereas small cells (SCs) are only utilized for data transmission. Under HCN,
SCs can be dynamically turned off when traffic load decreases for energy
saving. A fundamental problem then arises: how many SCs can be turned off as
traffic varies? In this paper, we address this problem in a theoretical way,
where two sleeping schemes (i.e., random and repulsive schemes) with vertical
inter-layer offloading are considered. Analytical results indicate the
following facts: (1) Under the random scheme where SCs are turned off with
certain probability, the expected ratio of sleeping SCs is inversely
proportional to the traffic load of SC-layer and decreases linearly with the
traffic load of MBS-layer; (2) The repulsive scheme, which only turns off the
SCs close to MBSs, is less sensitive to the traffic variations; (3) deploying
denser MBSs enables turning off more SCs, which may help to improve network
energy-efficiency. Numerical results show that about 50% SCs can be turned off
on average under the predefined daily traffic profiles, and 10% more SCs can be
further turned off with inter-layer channel borrowing.

spins with electric field gradients, which have been shown to suppress
diffusive nuclear spin dynamics. One might thus expect them to enhance electron
spin coherence. Here we show experimentally that for gate-defined GaAs quantum
dots, quadrupolar broadening of the nuclear Larmor precession can also reduce
electron spin coherence due to faster decorrelation of transverse nuclear
fields. However, this effect can be eliminated for appropriate field
directions. Furthermore, we observe an additional modulation of spin coherence
that can be attributed to an anisotropic electronic $g$-tensor. These results
complete our understanding of dephasing in gated quantum dots and point to
mitigation strategies. They may also help to unravel unexplained behaviour in

  We prove that the $f$-weighted Eden model clusters have an a.s. deterministic

limit shape of the standard Eden model, and estimate the rate of convergence to
this limit shape. We also prove that if $\alpha>1$, then there is a norm $\nu$

there does \emph{not} exist a norm on $\mathbb R^d$ for which this latter

partial-decode-forward. However, the requirement to explicitly decode part of
the message at intermediate nodes can be restrictive in some settings; for
example, when nodes have different side information regarding the state of the
channel. In this paper, we generalize this scheme to
$\textit{cooperative-bin-forward}$ by building on the observation that explicit
recovering of part of the message is not needed to induce cooperation. Instead,
encoders can bin their received signals and cooperatively forward the bin index
to the decoder. The main advantage of this new scheme is illustrated by
considering state-dependent extensions of the aforementioned semideterministic
setups. While partial-decode-forward is not applicable in these new setups,
cooperative-bin-forward continues to achieve capacity.

initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense
approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of
being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier prone as
they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar
correspondence. In this paper we present a dense correspondence field approach
that is much less outlier prone and thus much better suited for optical flow
estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach is
conceptually novel as it does not require explicit regularization, smoothing
(like median filtering) or a new data term, but solely our novel purely data
based search strategy that finds most inliers (even for small objects), while
it effectively avoids finding outliers. Moreover, we present novel enhancements
for outlier filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large

subject to random forces, such as the motion of a strand of DNA in a liquid or
heat flow around a ring. Semilinear stochastic wave equations can typically not
be solved explicitly, but the literature contains a number of results which
show that numerical approximation processes converge with suitable rates of
convergence to solutions of such equations. In the case of approximation
results for strong convergence rates, semilinear stochastic wave equations with
both additive or multiplicative noise have been considered in the literature.
In contrast, the existing approximation results for weak convergence rates
assume that the diffusion coefficient of the considered semilinear stochastic
wave equation is constant, that is, it is assumed that the considered wave
equation is driven by additive noise, and no approximation results for
multiplicative noise are known. The purpose of this work is to close this gap
and to establish sharp weak convergence rates for semilinear stochastic wave
equations with multiplicative noise. In particular, our weak convergence result
establishes as a special case essentially sharp weak convergence rates for the

that we stop being able to analyze the question we believe at with competence.
In this paper, I gather the evidence we have about taking sides and present the
obvious but unseen conclusion that these facts combined mean that we should
actually never believe in anything about the real world, except in a
probabilistic way. We must actually never take sides because taking sides
destroy out abilities to seek for the most correct description of the world.
That means we need to start reformulating the way we debate ideas, from our
teaching to our political debates, if we actually want to be able to arrive at
the best solutions as suggested by whatever evidence we might have. I will show
that this has deep consequences on a number of problems, ranging from the
emergence of extremism to the reliability of whole scientific fields. Inductive
reasoning requires that we allow every idea to make predictions so that we may
rank which ideas are better and that has important consequences in scientific
practice. The crisis around $p$-values is also discussed and much better
understood under the light of this paper results. Finally, I will debate
possible ideas to try to minimize the problem.

online learning framework, including model selection bounds and data-dependent
bounds. Given a data- or model-dependent bound we ask, ""Does there exist some
algorithm achieving this bound?"" We show that modifications to recently
introduced sequential complexity measures can be used to answer this question
by providing sufficient conditions under which adaptive rates can be achieved.
In particular each adaptive rate induces a set of so-called offset complexity
measures, and obtaining small upper bounds on these quantities is sufficient to
demonstrate achievability. A cornerstone of our analysis technique is the use
of one-sided tail inequalities to bound suprema of offset random processes.
  Our framework recovers and improves a wide variety of adaptive bounds
including quantile bounds, second-order data-dependent bounds, and small loss

optimization based on the spectral norm, as well as a new online PAC-Bayes

combining packets of different files following a greedy clique cover solution

  In this work, we initiate the finite-length analysis of random caching

$O((N/M)^g)$. We exhibit a random placement and an efficient clique cover based

because of the energy constraints and the channel conditions, it is important
to understand when a device should transmit and to optimize how much power

show that high secrecy rates can be obtained only with power and coding rate
adaptation. Moreover, we highlight the importance of optimally dividing the
transmission power in the frequency domain, and note that the optimal scheme
provides high gains in secrecy rate over the uniform power splitting case.
Analytically, we explain how to find the optimal policy and prove some of its
properties. In our numerical evaluation, we discuss how the maximum achievable

of the electrons wavenumbers in the direction perpendicular to the film
surfaces lead to the formation of quasi two-dimensional electronic sub-bands.
The electron-phonon coupling is treated in the deformation potential model and,
if we denote by $T_e$ the electrons temperature and by $T_{ph}$ the phonons
temperature, we find that $P\equiv P^{(0)}(T_{e})-P^{(1)}(T_{e},T_{ph})$;
$P^{(0)}$ is the power ""emitted"" by the electron system to the phonons and
$P^{(1)}$ is the power ""absorbed"" by the electrons from the phonons.
  Due to the quantization of the electronic states, $P$ vs $(d,T_e)$ and $P$ vs
$(d,T_{ph})$ show very strong oscillations with $d$, forming sharp crests
almost parallel to the temperature axes. In the valleys between the crests, $P
\propto T_e^{3.5} - T_{ph}^{3.5}$. From valley to crest, $P$ increases by more
than one order of magnitude and on the crests $P$ does not have a simple power
law dependence on temperature.
  The strong modulation of $P$ with the thickness of the film may provide a way
to control the electron-phonon heat power and the power dissipation in thin
metallic films. Eventually the same mechanism may be used to detect small
variations of $d$ or surface contamination. On the other hand, the surface
imperfections of the metallic films may make it difficult to observe the
oscillations of $P$ with $d$ and eventually due to averaging the effects the
heat flow would have a more smooth dependence on the thickness in real

  We study the same question in the distributional quantum setting, and show a
lower bound of $\Omega((n(k+1))^{1/4})$, and an upper bound, matching up to a
logarithmic factor.
  We show that there are total Boolean functions $f_d$ on $2n$ inputs that have
distributional communication complexity $O(\log n)$ under all distributions of
information up to $o(n)$, while the (interactive) distributional complexity
maximised over all distributions is $\Theta(\log d)$ for $6n\leq d\leq
2^{n/100}$.
  We show that in the setting of one-way communication under product
distributions, the dependence of communication cost on the allowed error
$\epsilon$ is multiplicative in $\log(1/\epsilon)$ -- the previous upper bounds
had the dependence of more than $1/\epsilon$.

the concept of trajectory, which evolves in time in compliance with dynamical
information conveyed by the wave function. Here this appealing idea is
considered to analyze both classical and quantum interference, thus providing
an alternative and more intuitive framework to understand the time-evolution of
waves, either in terms of the flow of energy (for mechanical waves, sound
waves, electromagnetic waves, for instance) or, analogously, the flow of
probability (quantum waves), respectively. Furthermore, this procedure also
supplies a more robust explanation of interference phenomena, which currently
is only based on the superposition principle. That is, while this principle
only describes how different waves combine and what effects these combinations
may lead to, flow lines provide a more precise explanation on how the energy or
probability propagate in space before, during and after the combination of such
waves, without dealing with them separately (i.e., the combination or
superposition is taken as a whole). In this sense, concepts such as
constructive and destructive interference, typically associated with the
superposition principle, physically correspond to more or less dense swarms of
(energy or probability) flow lines, respectively. A direct consequence of this
description is that, when considering the distribution of electromagnetic
energy flow lines behind two slits, each one covered by a differently oriented
polarizer, it is naturally found that external observers' information on the
slit crossed by single photons (understood as energy parcels) is totally
irrelevant for the existence of interference fringes, in striking contrast with

EP Aqr has been observed using the IRAM PdBI and the IRAM 30-m telescope. The
line profiles reveal the presence of two distinct components centered on the
star velocity, a broad component extending up to ~10 km/s and a narrow
component indicating an expansion velocity of ~2 km/s. An early analysis of
these data was performed under the assumption of isotropic winds. The present
study revisits this interpretation by assuming instead a bipolar outflow nearly
aligned with the line of sight. A satisfactory description of the observed flux
densities is obtained with a radial expansion velocity increasing from ~2 km/s
at the equator to ~10 km/s near the poles. The angular aperture of the bipolar
outflow is ~45 deg with respect to the star axis, which makes an angle of ~13
deg with the line of sight. A detailed study of the CO(1-0) to CO(2-1) flux
ratio reveals a significant dependence of the temperature on the star latitude,
smaller and steeper at the poles than at the equator at large distances from
the star. Under the hypothesis of radial expansion and of rotation invariance
about the star axis, the effective density has been evaluated in space as a
function of star coordinates. Evidence is found for an enhancement of the
effective density in the northern hemisphere of the star at angular distances
in excess of ~3"" and covering the whole longitudinal range. The peak velocity
of the narrow component is observed to vary slightly with position on the sky,
a variation consistent with the model and understood as the effect of the
inclination of the star axis with respect to the line of sight. While the
phenomenological model presented here reproduces well the general features of
the observations, significant differences are also revealed, which would
require a better spatial resolution to be properly described.

the pseudo-scalar pNG bosons $\pi$ and the matter fields $V=(\rho,\omega)$ as
relevant degrees of freedom. Implementing the skyrmion-half-skyrmion transition
predicted at large $N_c$ in QCD at a density roughly twice the nuclear matter
density found in the crystal simulation of dense skyrmion matter, we determine
the intrinsically density-dependent (IDD) ""bare parameters"" of the
scale-invariant HLS Lagrangian matched to QCD at a matching scale $\Lambda_M$.
The resulting effective Lagrangian, with the parameters scaling with the
density of the system, is applied to nuclear matter and dense baryonic matter
relevant to massive compact stars by means of the double-decimation
renormalization-group $V_{lowk}$ formalism. We satisfactorily post-dict the
properties of normal nuclear matter and more significantly {\it predict} the
EoS of dense compact-star matter that quantitatively accounts for the presently
available data coming from both the terrestrial and space laboratories. We
interpret the resulting structure of compact-star matter as revealing how the

electromagnetically-induced transparency and slow light, and directly measure
the resulting nonlinear phase shift for individual photons. This is done by
illuminating the sample with a weak classical pulse with as few as 0.5 photons
per pulse on average, and using post-selection to determine whether a given
pulse contained (approximately) 0 or 1 photons. We present clear data showing
the quantized dependence of a probe beam's measured phase shift on the

estimating a function starting from noisy and discrete measurements. More
precisely, we aim at estimating functions lying on a surface represented by

least-square functional. The latter is equivalent to solve a 4th-order Partial
Differential Equation (PDE). In this context, we use Isogeometric Analysis
(IGA) for the numerical approximation of such surface PDE, leading to an
IsoGeometric Smoothing (IGS) method for fitting data spatially distributed on a

representation of the surface in the analysis and also allows the use of at
least globally $C^1-$continuous NURBS basis functions for which the 4th-order

that Inverse seesaw leads to 7 allowed two-zero textures while the Linear
seesaw leads to only one. In Inverse seesaw, we show that 2 is the maximum

to a realization of all the phenomenologically allowed two-zero textures

simultaneously in the dayside magnetosheath and magnetosphere, were used to
collect 646 large-scale magnetosheath plasma jets interacting with the
magnetopause. The jets were identified as dense and fast streams of the
magnetosheath plasma whose energy density is higher than that of the upstream
solar wind. The jet interaction with the magnetopause was revealed from sudden
inward motion of the magnetopause and an enhancement in the geomagnetic field.
The penetration was determined as appearance of the magnetosheath plasma
against the background of the hot magnetospheric particle population. We found
that almost 60% of the jets penetrated through the magnetopause. Vast majority
of the penetrating jets was characterized by high velocities V > 220 km/s and
kinetic bk > 1 that corresponded to a combination of finite Larmor radius
effect with a mechanisms of impulsive penetration. The average plasma flux in
the penetrating jets was found to be 1.5 times larger than the average plasma
flux of the solar wind. The average rate of jet-related penetration of the
magnetosheath plasma into the dayside magnetosphere was estimated to be ~10^29
particles per day. The rate varies highly with time and can achieve values of
1.5*10^29 particles per hour that is comparable with estimates of the total
amount of plasma entering the dayside magnetosphere.

exists a large set of different quantum states that can be used as decoy
qubits. In the absence of noise, any choice of decoy qubits provides equivalent
security. In this paper, we examine such equivalence for noisy environment
(e.g., in amplitude damping, phase damping, collective dephasing and collective
rotation noise channels) by comparing the decoy-qubit assisted schemes of
secure quantum communication that use single qubit states as decoy qubits with
the schemes that use entangled states as decoy qubits. Our study reveals that
the single qubit assisted scheme perform better in some noisy environments,
while some entangled qubits assisted schemes perform better in other noisy
environments. Specifically, single qubits assisted schemes perform better in
amplitude damping and phase damping noisy channels, whereas a few
Bell-state-based decoy schemes are found to perform better in the presence of
the collective noise. Thus, if the kind of noise present in a communication
channel (i.e., the characteristics of the channel) is known or measured, then
the present study can provide the best choice of decoy qubits required for
implementation of schemes of secure quantum communication through that channel.

naively expect such stars to be detectable at this distance (4.5 kpc). By
modelling the ultraviolet radiation field from post-AGB stars and white dwarfs

radii from their host stars and that the line intensities are about two orders
of magnitude below our current detection limits. The truncation of CO envelopes
should be important for AGB stars in dense clusters. Observing the CO (3-2) and

is affected by orientation profiles with defects of various types and

In the scope of a thin drop approximation, we derive exact expressions for the
flow in the drop that is generated by a given orientation profile. The flow has
a natural decomposition into terms that depend entirely on the geometrical
properties of the orientation profile, i.e. its bend and splay, and a term
coupling the orientation to the shape of the drop. We find that asymmetric
splay or bend generates a directed bulk flow and enables the drop to move, with
maximal speeds achieved when the splay or bend is induced by a topological
defect in the interior of the drop. In motile drops the direction and speed of
self-propulsion is controlled by friction at the substrate.

dedicated XMM-Newton observation of the source, we found intriguing evidence of
a very fast spin period. We re-observed 2XMM J104608.7-594306 with XMM-Newton
to better characterise the spectral energy distribution of the source, confirm
the candidate spin period, and possibly constrain the pulsar spin-down.
Statistically acceptable spectral fits and meaningful physical parameters for
the source are only obtained when the purely thermal spectrum is modified by at
least one line in absorption. The implied distance is consistent with a
location in (or in front of) the Carina nebula, and radiation radii are
compatible with emission originating on most of the surface. Non-thermal X-ray
emission is ruled out at levels above 0.5% of the source luminosity.
Unfortunately, the second XMM-Newton observation proved inconclusive in terms
of confirming (discarding) the fast candidate spin, providing an upper limit on
the pulsed fraction of the source that is very close to the limiting
sensitivity for detecting the modulation found previously. In the absence of an
unambiguous period determination and an estimate of the magnetic field, the
nature of the source remains open to interpretation. Its likely association
with the Carina cluster and its overall spectral properties (only shared by a
handful of other peculiar INSs) disfavour a standard evolutionary path, or one
in which the source was previously recycled by accretion in a binary system.

16 Lacertae is reported. 749 h of high-quality differential photoelectric
Stromgren, Johnson and Geneva time-series photometry were obtained with ten
telescopes during 185 nights. After removing the pulsation contribution, an
attempt was made to solve the resulting eclipse light curve by means of the
computer program EBOP. Although a unique solution was not obtained, the range
of solutions could be constrained by comparing computed positions of the
secondary component in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary
tracks.
  For three high-amplitude pulsation modes, the uvy and the Geneva UBG
amplitude ratios are derived and compared with the theoretical ones for
spherical-harmonic degrees l <= 4. The highest degree, l = 4, is shown to be
incompatible with the observations. One mode is found to be radial, one is l =
1, while in the remaining case l = 2 or 3.
  The present multisite observations are combined with the archival photometry
in order to investigate the long-term variation of the amplitudes and phases of
the three high-amplitude pulsation modes. The radial mode shows a
non-sinusoidal variation on a time-scale of 73 yr. The l = 1 mode is a triplet
with unequal frequency spacing, giving rise to two beat-periods, 720.7 d and
29.1 yr. The amplitude and phase of the l = 2 or 3 mode vary on time-scales of
380.5 d and 43 yr.
  The light variation of 2 And, one of the comparison stars, is discussed in
the Appendix.

allocation of the resource. On the other hand fair/balanced allocations may be
far from being optimal from a central point of view. So, in this paper we are
interested in assessing the quality of fair solutions, i.e. in measuring the

maximizes the sum of agents utilities. This indicator is usually called the
Price of Fairness and we study it under three different definitions of

where each agent can consume the resource in given discrete quantities (items),

necessary to reflect the highly functional and diverse behaviour inherent to
many systems found in reality. Anaerobic digestion is one such process that has
benefitted from the application of mathematical analysis not only for
characterising the biological dynamics, but also to investigate emergent
behaviour not apparent by simulation alone. Nevertheless, the standard
modelling approach has been to describe biological systems using sets of
differential equations whose kinetics are generally described by some
empirically derived function of growth. The drawbacks of this are two-fold; the
growth functions are derived from empirical studies that may not be
representative of the system to be modelled and whose parameters may not have a
mechanistic meaning, and mathematical analysis is restricted by a conformity to
an assumption of the dynamics. Here, we attempt to address these challenges by
investigating a generalised form of a three-tier chlorophenol mineralising

stability of the identified steady-states and find that, without a decay term,
the system may be characterised analytically. However, it is necessary to
perform numerical analysis for the case when maintenance is included, but in

steady-state is always stable, and ii) the two other steady-states can be
unstable according to the initial conditions and operating parameters.

strong local Coulomb repulsion on the transient dynamics of a qubit that is
probed capacitively. We show that the measurement backaction induced by the
noise of electron cotunneling through the sensor is surprisingly mitigated by
the recently identified coherent backaction [PRB 89, 195405] arising from
quantum fluctuations. This renormalization effect is missing in semiclassical
stochastic fluctuator models and typically also in Born-Markov approaches,
which try to avoid the calculation of the nonstationary, nonequilibrium state
of the qubit plus sensor. Technically, we integrate out the current-carrying
electrodes to obtain kinetic equations for the joint, nonequilibrium
detector-qubit dynamics. We show that the sensor-current response, level
renormalization, cotunneling, and leading non-Markovian corrections always
appear together and cannot be turned off individually in an experiment or
ignored theoretically. We analyze the backaction on the reduced qubit state -
capturing the full non-Markovian effects imposed by the sensor quantum dot on
the qubit - by applying a Liouville-space decomposition into quasistationary
and rapidly decaying modes. Importantly, the sensor cannot be eliminated
completely even in the simplest high-temperature, weak-measurement limit: The
qubit state experiences an initial slip that persists over many qubit cycles
and depends on the initial preparation of qubit plus sensor quantum dot. A
quantum-dot sensor can thus not be modeled as a 'black box' without accounting
for its dynamical variables. We furthermore find that the Bloch vector relaxes
(T1) along an axis that is not orthogonal to the plane in which the Bloch
vector dephases (T2), blurring the notions of T1 and T2 times. Finally, the
precessional motion of the Bloch vector is distorted into an ellipse in the

evolution of the Hamiltonian that includes both the shift and the coin
generators. Based on the Trotter-Suzuki first-order approximation, we consider
an optimization problem in which the Hellinger distance between the walker
probability distributions resulted from the evolution of such Hamiltonian and
the quantum walk dynamics is minimized. The phase space implementation of the
quantum walk is considered where the walker state is encoded on the coherent
state of a resonator and the coin on the two-level state of a qubit. In this
approach, no mechanism for switching between the coin and the shift operators
is included. We show the Hellinger distance is bounded for large number of time
steps. The distance is small when we deviate from the standard quantum walk
model, namely, when the walker is allowed to move in between the sites. In
simulating the standard quantum walk model, the distance is large but bounded
by $26\%$ for a relevant number of time steps. Even so, the system evolution
shows the essential characteristics of the standard quantum walk dynamics,
namely, the ballistic evolution of the probability distribution and the linear
growth of the corresponding standard deviation. Moreover, the entanglement
generated in this approach is approximately the same as the entanglement
generated in the standard quantum walk dynamics. Finally, the system dynamics
under the influence of the decoherence also shows the similar
quantum-to-classical transition as in the standard quantum walk dynamics.

for understanding the nature and origin of solar eruptions. To derive
information on the 3D structure of CMEs from white-light (total and polarized
brightness) images, the polarization ratio technique is widely used. The
soon-to-be-launched METIS coronagraph on board Solar Orbiter will use this
technique to produce new polarimetric images. We determine the accuracy at
which the position of the centre of mass, direction and speed of propagation,
and the column density of the CME can be determined along the line of sight. We
perform a 3D MHD simulation of a flux rope ejection where a CME is produced.
From the simulation we (i) synthesize the corresponding METIS white-light
(total and polarized brightness) images and (ii) apply the polarization ratio
technique to these synthesized images and compare the results with the known
density distribution from the MHD simulation. We find that the polarization
ratio technique reproduces with high accuracy the position of the centre of
mass along the line of sight. However, some errors are inherently associated
with this determination. The polarization ratio technique also allows
information to be derived on the real 3D direction of propagation of the CME.
In addition, we find that the column density derived from white-light images is
accurate and we propose an improved technique where the combined use of the
polarization ratio technique and white-light images minimizes the error in the
estimation of column densities. Our method allows us to thoroughly test the
performance of the polarization ratio technique and allows a determination of
the errors associated with it, which means that it can be used to quantify the
results from the analysis of the forthcoming METIS observations in white light

antikaon nuclear bound states - the prototype system being K-pp. A unique and
rather direct experimental access to the antikaon-nucleon scattering lengths is
provided by precision X-ray spectroscopy of transitions in low-lying states of
light kaonic atoms like kaonic hydrogen isotopes. In the SIDDHARTA experiment
at the electron-positron collider DA?NE of LNF-INFN we measured the most
precise values of the strong interaction observables, i.e. the strong
interaction on the 1s ground state of the electromagnetically bound K-p atom
leading to a hadronic shift and a hadronic broadening of the 1s state. The
SIDDHARTA result triggered new theoretical work which achieved major progress
in the understanding of the low-energy strong interaction with strangeness.
Antikaon-nucleon scattering lengths have been calculated constrained by the
SIDDHARTA data on kaonic hydrogen. For the extraction of the isospin-dependent
scattering lengths a measurement of the hadronic shift and width of kaonic
deuterium is necessary. Therefore, new X-ray studies with the focus on kaonic
deuterium are in preparation (SIDDHARTA2). Many improvements in the
experimental setup will allow to measure kaonic deuterium which is challenging
due to the anticipated low X-ray yield. Especially important are the data on

not achieve maximal payoff and the behaviour of individual players remains
inhomogeneous even after playing many rounds. For instance, in repeated
prisoner dilemma games humans do not always optimize their mean reward and
frequently exhibit broad distributions of cooperativity. The reasons for these
failures of maximization are not known. Here we show that the dynamics
resulting from the tendency to shift choice probabilities towards previously
rewarding choices in closed loop interaction with the strategy of the opponent
can not only explain systematic deviations from 'rationality', but also
reproduce the diversity of choice behaviours. As a representative example we
investigate the dynamics of choice probabilities in prisoner dilemma games with
opponents using strategies with different degrees of extortion and generosity.
We find that already a simple model for human learning can account for a
surprisingly wide range of human decision behaviours. It reproduces suppression
of cooperation against extortionists and increasing cooperation when playing
with generous opponents, explains the broad distributions of individual choices
in ensembles of players, and predicts the evolution of individual subjects'
cooperation rates over the course of the games. We conclude that important
aspects of human decision behaviours are rooted in elementary learning
mechanisms realised in the brain.

common visual patterns of a flexible number of categories; (2) encode
discriminative information; and (3) hierarchically extract patterns at
different visual levels. Particularly, in each single layer of DDSFL, shareable
filters are jointly learned for classes which share the similar patterns.
Discriminative power of the filters is achieved by enforcing the features from
the same category to be close, while features from different categories to be
far away from each other. Furthermore, we also propose two exemplar selection

Theory calculations have been carried out on DPAH+ molecules to see the
variations in the spectral behaviour from that of a pure PAH. DPAH+ molecules
show features that arise due to the stretching of the aliphatic C-D bond.
Deuterated PAHs have been previously reported as carriers for such features.
However, preferred conditions of ionization of PAHs in the interstellar medium
(ISM) indicates the possibility of the formation of DPAH+ molecules. Comparison
of band positions of DPAH+ s shows reasonable agreement with the observations.
We report the effect of size of the DPAH+ molecules on band positions and
intensities. This study also reports a D/H ratio ([D/H]sc ; the ratio of C-D
stretch and C-H stretch bands per [D/H]num ) that is decreasing with the
increasing size of DPAH+ s. It is noted that large DPAH+ molecules (no. of C
atoms ~ 50) match the D/H ratio that has been estimated from observations. This
ratio offers prospects to study the deuterium abundance and depletion in the

can be characterized as control problems, with the goal of finding strategies
to change a disease or otherwise undesirable state of a biological system into
another, more desirable, state through an intervention, such as a drug or other
therapeutic treatment. The identification of such strategies is typically based
on a mathematical model of the process to be altered through targeted control
inputs. This paper focuses on processes at the molecular level that determine
the state of an individual cell, involving signaling or gene regulation. The
mathematical model type considered is that of Boolean networks. The potential
control targets can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can be
manipulated to produce a desired effect on the system. Experimentally, node
manipulation requires technology to completely repress or fully activate a
particular gene product while edge manipulations only require a drug that
inactivates the interaction between two gene products. Results: This paper
presents a method for the identification of potential intervention targets in
Boolean molecular network models using algebraic techniques. The approach
exploits an algebraic representation of Boolean networks to encode the control
candidates in the network wiring diagram as the solutions of a system of
polynomials equations, and then uses computational algebra techniques to find
such controllers. The control methods in this paper are validated through the
identification of combinatorial interventions in the signaling pathways of
previously reported control targets in two well studied systems, a p53-mdm2
network and a blood T cell lymphocyte granular leukemia survival signaling
network.

obtained by the conventional treatments of spin diffusion which rely on the use
of the derivative $\partial \hat n/\partial\eta$ [2,3,4]. As a vehicle we
consider a ring with a Siberian Snake and electron polarisation in the plane of
the ring (Machine II in [1]). For this simple setup with its one-dimensional
spin motion, we avoid having to deal directly with the Bloch equation [5,6] for
the polarisation density. Our treatment, which is deliberately pedagogical,
shows that the use of $\partial \hat n/\partial\eta$ provides a very good
approximation to the rate of spin depolarisation in the model considered. But
it then shows that the exact rate of depolarisation can be obtained by
replacing $\partial \hat n/\partial\eta$ by another derivative as suggested in
the Epilogue of [1], while giving a heuristic justification for the new
derivative.

even if C is not used with the distribution P_0 it was tailored for. Next I
show that if C will be re-used, then the minimal work to run it depends only on

establishes a formal identity between the thermodynamics of (re-usable)

Heterodyning of two individually filtered optical pulses that are pre-chirped

signal. The working bands can be flexibly tailored with desired bandwidth at
user-preferred carrier frequency. After modulated onto the pre-chirped optical

as a Markov decision process (MDP). We study how to utilize the monotonicity of
the optimal transmission policy to relieve the computational complexity of
dynamic programming (DP). In this system, a scheduler controls the bit rate of
the m-quadrature amplitude modulation (m-QAM) in order to minimize the
long-term losses incurred by the queue overflow in the data link layer and the
transmission power consumption in the physical layer. The work is done in two
steps. Firstly, we observe the L-natural-convexity and submodularity of DP to
prove that the optimal policy is always nondecreasing in queue occupancy/state
and derive the sufficient condition for it to be nondecreasing in both queue
and channel states. We also show that, due to the L-natural-convexity of DP,
the variation of the optimal policy in queue state is restricted by a bounded
marginal effect: The increment of the optimal policy between adjacent queue
states is no greater than one. Secondly, we use the monotonicity results to
present two low complexity algorithms: monotonic policy iteration (MPI) based
on L-natural-convexity and discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic
approximation (DSPSA). We run experiments to show that the time complexity of
MPI based on L-natural-convexity is much lower than that of DP and the
conventional MPI that is based on submodularity and DSPSA is able to adaptively
track the optimal policy when the system parameters change.

concerned. Other topics, such as abstract algebraic logic, modal logic and the
so--called (central) finitizability problem in algebraic logic will be dealt

adressing classes of cylindric--like algebras consisting of algebras having a

results of Hirsch and Hodkinson on non--atom canonicity, non--first order
definabiity and non--finite axiomatizability, proved for classes of
representable cylindric algebras of finite dimension$>2$. We show that such

diffusive shock acceleration theory in the linear test particle regime, which

invalid for this relic. We also measured the temperature difference across the

the X-ray surface brightness analysis of the XMM-Newton data, and obtained
consistent results in an independent way. We searched for the non-thermal

Li-Ma problem, is a statistical problem where a
measured rate is the sum of two parts. The first is due to a signal and the
second due to a background, both of which are unknown. Mostly frequentist
solutions are being used that are only adequate for high count numbers. When
the events are rare such an approximation is not good enough. Indeed, in
high-energy astrophysics this is often the rule rather than the exception. I
will present a universal objective Bayesian solution that depends only on the
initial three parameters of the On-Off problem: the number of events in the
""on"" region, the number of events in the ""off"" region, and their
ratio-of-exposure. With a two-step approach it is possible to infer the
signal's significance, strength, uncertainty or upper limit in a unified a way.
The approach is valid without restrictions for any count number including zero
and may be widely applied in particle physics, cosmic-ray physics and
high-energy astrophysics. I apply the method to Gamma Ray Burst data.

sequences which is equivalent to this idea dates back to the ancient world.
Archimedes calculated the unknown in excess and deficiency, approximating with
two sets of values: ambient and nested values. Buridan came up with a concept
of a point lying within a sequence of nested intervals. Fermat, Gregory,
Newton, MacLaurin, Gauss,and Fourier used to search for an unknown value with
the help of approximation in excess and deficiency. In the 19-th century, in
works of Bolzano, Cauchy, Lejeune Dirichlet, Weierstrass, and Cantor, this
logical construction turned into the analysis argumentation method. The concept
of a real number was elaborated in the 1870-s in works of Meray, Weierstrass,
Heine, Cantor, and Dedekind. Cantor elaboration was based on the notion of a
limiting point and principle of nested intervals. What we are going to consider
now, is the genesis of this idea which dates back to the ancient world.

solutions have a heat flux that is exponential in time (either growth or
decay), and satisfying a linear Helmholtz equation in space. This construction
extends also to heterogeneous diffusion wherein the nonlinear diffusivity
factorises to the product of a function of temperature and a function of

conjunction with either exothermic or endothermic reactions, and to soil-water

equation is used to predict the existence of oscillons and oscillating kinks
for certain regimes of the ratio of the Higgs to the gauge field masses.
Results of numerical simulations are found to be in very good agreement with
the analytical findings, and show that the oscillons are robust, while kinks
are unstable. It is also demonstrated that oscillons emerge spontaneously as a
result of the onset of the modulational instability of plane wave solutions of
the model. Connections of the obtained solutions with the phenomenology of

multi-scale cohesive method (VMCM). The VMCM results demonstrate the influence
of specimen geometry and load distribution on the propagation of large scale
bridging cracks in the fiber reinforced panel. Experimentally observed
variation in fracture resistance is substantiated numerically by comparing the
experimental and VMCM load-displacement responses of geometrically scaled
single edge-notch three point bend (SETB) specimens. The results elucidate the
size dependence of the traction-separation relationship for this class of
materials even in moderately large specimens, contrary to the conventional
understanding of it being a material property. The existence of a ""free
bridging zone"" (different from the conventional ""full bridging zone"") is
recognized, and its influence on the evolving fracture resistance is discussed.
The numerical simulations and ensuing bridging zone evolution analysis
demonstrates the versatility of VMCM in objectively simulating progressive
crack propagation, compared against conventional numerical schemes like
traditional cohesive zone modeling, which require a priori knowledge of the
crack path.

challenges in post genomic era for the biologist and researchers. Several
intelligent techniques and models were already proposed to identify the
regulatory relations among genes from the biological database like time series
microarray data. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the most popular and
simple approach to model the dynamics as well as to infer correct dependencies
among genes. In this paper, Bat Algorithm (BA) is applied to optimize the model
parameters of RNN model of Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). Initially the
proposed method is tested against small artificial network without any noise
and the efficiency is observed in term of number of iteration, number of
population and BA optimization parameters. The model is also validated in
presence of different level of random noise for the small artificial network
and that proved its ability to infer the correct inferences in presence of
noise like real world dataset. In the next phase of this research, BA based RNN
is applied to real world benchmark time series microarray dataset of E. coli.
The results prove that it can able to identify the maximum number of true
positive regulation but also include some false positive regulations.
Therefore, BA is very suitable for identifying biological plausible GRN with
the help RNN model.

populations, where the links are given by a random asymmetric matrix J, with
fraction 1-C of zero entries, where C reflects the over-all connectivity of the
system. The non-zero elements of J are drawn from a gaussian distribution with
mean 'mu' and standard deviation . The signs of the elements J reflect the
nature of density-dependent interactions, such as predatory-prey, mutualism or
competition, and their magnitudes reflect the strength of the interaction. In
this study we try to uncover the broad features of the interspecies
interactions that determine the global robustness of this network, as indicated
by the average number of active nodes (i.e. non-extinct species) in the
network, and the total population, reflecting the biomass yield. We find that
the network transitions from a completely extinct system to one where all nodes
are active, as the mean interaction strength goes from negative to positive. We
also find that the total population, displays distinct non-monotonic scaling
behaviour with respect to the product 'mu'C, implying that survival is
dependent not merely on the number of links, but rather on the combination of
the sparseness of the connectivity matrix and the net interaction strength.
Moreover, the total population levels are optimal when the network has
intermediate net positive connection strengths. At the local level we observe
marked qualitative changes in dynamical patterns, ranging from anti-phase
clusters of period 2 cycles and chaotic bands, to fixed points, under the
variation of mean 'mu' of the interaction strengths. Lastly, we propose an
effective low dimensional map to capture the behavior of the entire network,
and this provides a broad understanding of the interplay of the local dynamical
patterns and the global robustness trends in the network.
