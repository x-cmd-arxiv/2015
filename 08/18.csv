largely determine the plasma profiles in the region. In a conduction limited
SOL, parallel temperature gradients are expected, such that the resistance to
parallel currents is greater at the target than further upstream. Since the
perpendicular motion of an isolated filament is largely determined by balance
of currents that flow through it, this may be expected to affect filament
transport. 3D simulations have thus been used to study the influence of
enhanced parallel resistivity on the dynamics of filaments. Filaments with the
smallest perpendicular length scales, which were inertially limited at low
resistivity (meaning that polarization rather than parallel currents determine
their radial velocities), were unaffected by resistivity. For larger filaments,
faster velocities were produced at higher resistivities, due to two mechanisms.
Firstly parallel currents were reduced and polarization currents were enhanced,
meaning that the inertial regime extended to larger filaments, and secondly a
potential difference formed along the parallel direction so that higher
potentials were produced in the region of the filament for the same amount of
current to flow into the sheath. These results indicate that broader SOL
profiles could be produced at higher resistivities.

processes in computing systems; the theory is itself a theory of computing; it
can be the basis for new architectures for computers; information compression
via the matching and unification of patterns and, more specifically, via
multiple alignment, is fundamental; transparency in the representation and
processing of knowledge; the discovery of 'natural' structures via information
compression (DONSVIC); interpretations of mathematics; interpretations in human
perception and cognition; and realisation of abstract concepts in terms of
neurons and their inter-connections (""SP-neural""). These things relate to
AI-related alternatives: minimum length encoding and related concepts; deep
learning in neural networks; unified theories of cognition and related
research; universal search; Bayesian networks and more; pattern recognition and
vision; the analysis, production, and translation of natural language;
Unsupervised learning of natural language; exact and inexact forms of
reasoning; representation and processing of diverse forms of knowledge; IBM's
Watson; software engineering; solving problems associated with big data, and in
the development of intelligence in autonomous robots. In conclusion, the SP
system can provide a firm foundation for the long-term development of AI, with
many potential benefits and applications. It may also deliver useful results on
relatively short timescales. A high-parallel, open-source version of the SP

probability that can be achieved in sending a fixed number of messages over a
noisy channel. This was first studied in the pioneering work of Shannon who
established a simple expression characterizing this quantity in the limit of
multiple independent uses of the channel. Here we consider the general setting
with only one use of the channel. We observe that the maximum success
probability can be expressed as the maximum value of a submodular function.
Using this connection, we establish the following results:
  1. There is a simple greedy polynomial-time algorithm that computes a code
achieving a (1-1/e)-approximation of the maximum success probability. Moreover,
for this problem it is NP-hard to obtain an approximation ratio strictly better
than (1-1/e).
  2. Shared quantum entanglement between the sender and the receiver can
increase the success probability by a factor of at most 1/(1-1/e). In addition,
this factor is tight if one allows an arbitrary non-signaling box between the
sender and the receiver.
  3. We give tight bounds on the one-shot performance of the meta-converse of
Polyanskiy-Poor-Verdu.

given by symmetric diagonally dominant M-matrices based on the parallel solver
of Spielman and Peng. We propose two versions of the solvers, where in the
first, full communication in the network is required, while in the second
communication is restricted to the R-Hop neighborhood between nodes for some $R

solvers, showing that our methods are capable of outperforming state-of-the-art

  Having developed such solvers, we then contribute by proposing an accurate
distributed Newton method for network flow optimization. Exploiting the
sparsity pattern of the dual Hessian, we propose a Newton method for network
flow optimization that is both faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art
techniques. Our method utilizes the distributed SDDM solvers for determining
the Newton direction up to any arbitrary precision $\epsilon >0$. We analyze
the properties of our algorithm and show superlinear convergence within a

randomly generated and barbell networks, we demonstrate that our approach is

thermoelectric effects in graphene. One considers the case of free standing
graphene taking into account interaction with intrinsic acoustic phonons. The
temperatures considered range from liquid nitrogen to the room level. It has
turned out that the contribution to thermoelectromotive force due to electron
drag by phonons is determined by the Fermi energy in the sample and phonon
relaxation time. The explicit temperature dependence of the contribution to
thermoelectromotive force deriving from by phonons is weak in contrast to that
due to diffusion, which is directly proportional to temperature. The dependence
obtained suggests that at the temperatures considered, a high carrier
concentration and for samples with a high thermal conductivity, the phonon drag
contribution can become dominant. Thus a theoretical limit has been established
for a possible increase of the thermoelectromotive force through electron drag
by the intrinsic phonons of graphene.

measurement apparatus that represent the possible positions of the display
pointer of the equipment. The origin of this concept lies in attempts to fill
the blanks in the Everett's relative-state interpretation, and to make it a
fully valid description of physical reality. To achieve this, it was necessary
to consider not only the main system interacting with the measurement apparatus
(like von Neumann and Everett did) but also the role of the environment in
eliminating correlations between different possible measurements when
interacting with the measurement apparatus. The interaction of the environment
with the main system (and the measurement apparatus) is the core of the
decoherence theory, which followed Everett's thesis. In this article, we review
the measurement process according to von Neumann, Everett's relative state
interpretation, the purpose of decoherence and some of its follow-up until
Wojciech Zurek's primordial paper that consolidated the concept of pointer
state, previously presented by Heinz Dieter Zeh. Employing a simple physical
model consisting of a pair of two-level systems -- one representing the main
system, the other the measurement apparatus -- and a thermal bath --
representing the environment -- we show how pointer states emerge, explaining
its contributions to the question of measurement in quantum mechanics, as well
as its limitations. Finally, we briefly show some of its consequences. This
paper is accessible to readers with elementary knowledge about quantum

physics, it allows the calculation of weak scattering via the Fourier transform
of the scattering potential. As was done by previous authors (Ge et al 2014 New

formula the resonant-states (RSs) of the scatterer. However in this study
unlike previous studies the included eigen-modes are correctly normalised with
dramatic positive consequences for the accuracy of the method. The
normalisation of the RSs used in the previous RSE Born approximation or
resonant-state-expansion Born approximation made in Ge et al (2014 New J. Phys.

using my recently discovered RSE perturbation theory for dispersive
electrodynamic scatterers (Muljarov et al 2010 Europhys. Lett. 92 50010; Doost

including data from teaching interviews and classroom observations on student

improved students' abilities to complete the tutorial during the allowed class

makes use of subsidiary $(N-1)$-particle states which are propagated in time in
addition to the true $N$-particle state, but does not involve spontaneous
breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry associated with particle number conservation.
Provided the flow in Fock space possesses a property which we call maximum

time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and then serves as macroscopic wave
function of the forced $N$-particle system. The general procedure is
illustrated in detail by numerical calculations performed for the model of a
driven bosonic Josephson junction, which allows one to keep track of all
contributions which usually are subject to uncontrolled assumptions. These
calculations indicate that macroscopic wave functions can persist even under
conditions of strong forcing, but are rapidly destroyed upon entering a regime

stretching and unzipping forces. Two classes of models are considered. In one
case the origin of elasticity is entropic due to the polymeric correlations,
and in the other the double-stranded DNA is taken to have an intrinsic rigidity
for bending. In both cases single strands are completely flexible. The change
in the elastic constant for the flexible case due to thermally generated
bubbles is obtained exactly. For the case of intrinsic rigidity, the elastic
constant is found to be proportional to the square root of the bubble number

the ability of the Mahalanobis distance to the association log-likelihood
distance to yield correct association relations in Monte-Carlo simulations. It
turns out that on average the distance based on association log-likelihood

applications ranging from security, medicine and defense. Sensors with the
capability to process information rapidly require adaptive algorithms to
control their search in response to noisy observations. In this paper, we
discuss classes of dynamic, adaptive search problems, and formulate the
resulting sensor control problems as stochastic control problems with imperfect
information, based on previous work on noisy search problems. The structure of
these problems, with objective functions related to information entropy, allows
for a complete characterization of the optimal strategies and the optimal cost
for the resulting finite-horizon stochastic control problems. We study the
problem where an individual sensor is capable of searching over multiple
sub-regions in a time, and provide a constructive algorithm for determining
optimal policies in real time based on convex optimization. We also study the
problem in which there are multiple sensors, each of which is only capable of
detecting over one sub-region in a time, jointly searching for an object.
Whereas this can be viewed as a special case of our multi-region results, we
show that the computation of optimal policies can be decoupled into
single-sensor individual scalar convex optimization problems, and provide
simple symmetry conditions where the solutions can be determined analytically.
We also consider the case where individual sensors can select the accuracy of
their sensing modes with different costs, and derive optimal strategies for
these problems in terms of the solutions of scalar convex optimization
problems. We illustrate our results with experiments using multiple sensors

the bulk superconducting disorder even in the absence of any disorder in the
nanowire (or the superconductor-nanowire interface) when the proximity tunnel
coupling is strong. In particular, bulk disorder can effectively randomize the
Shiba-state energies. In the case of a proximate semiconductor nanowire, we
numerically compute the dependence of the effective disorder and pairing gap
induced on the wire as a function of the semiconductor-superconductor tunnel
coupling. We find that the scaling exponent of the induced disorder with
respect to coupling is always larger than that of the induced gap, implying
that at weak coupling, the proximity-induced pairing gap dominates, whereas at
strong coupling, the induced disorder dominates. These findings bring out the
importance of improving the quality of the bulk superconductor itself (in
addition to the quality of the nanowire and the interface) in the experimental
search for solid-state Majorana fermions in proximity-coupled hybrid structures

the semiconductor and the superconductor in a goal toward having a large

Since a low level of ultraviolet radiation from stars suffices to dissociate
molecular hydrogen, under the usually-assumed scenario this primordial mode of
star formation ended by redshift $z \sim 15$ and much more massive halos came
to dominate star formation. However, metal enrichment from the first stars may
have allowed the smaller halos to continue to form stars. In this Letter we
explore the possible effect of star formation in metal-rich low-mass halos on
the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from $z = 6-40$. These halos
are significantly affected by the supersonic streaming velocity, with its
characteristic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature. Thus, enrichment of
low-mass galaxies can produce a strong signature in the 21-cm power spectrum
over a wide range of redshifts, especially if star formation in the small halos
was more efficient than suggested by current simulations. We show that upcoming

there must be an enhancement of the curvature fluctuations during the bounce

remarkable match to the stellar light profile; star formation history;
metallicity distribution function; and star/gas kinematics of isolated dwarf

dark matter (ADM) component. We find that the decay of the lightest eigenstate
of scalar component of color triplet superfield gives the observed baryon
asymmetry in the visible sector, an asymmetric dark matter component with the
right abundance and naturally explains cosmic coincidence.

contains a full, explicit enumeration of all players---even though in the real
world, ""players"" are no more fundamentally special than rocks or clouds. It
isn't trivial to find a decision-theoretic foundation for game theory in which
an agent's coplayers are a non-distinguished part of the agent's environment.
Attempts to model both players and the environment as Turing machines, for
example, fail for standard diagonalization reasons.
  In this paper, we introduce a ""reflective"" type of oracle, which is able to
answer questions about the outputs of oracle machines with access to the same
oracle. These oracles avoid diagonalization by answering some queries randomly.
We show that machines with access to a reflective oracle can be used to define
rational agents using causal decision theory. These agents model their
environment as a probabilistic oracle machine, which may contain other agents
as a non-distinguished part.
  We show that if such agents interact, they will play a Nash equilibrium, with
the randomization in mixed strategies coming from the randomization in the
oracle's answers. This can be seen as providing a foundation for classical game
theory in which players aren't special.

from non-Abelian anyons, such as Fibonacci anyons described by $SU(2)_3$
theories, which are quantum deformations of the $SU(2)$ algebra. Inspired by
the physics of $SU(2)$ spins, several works have explored ladders of Fibonacci
anyons and also one-dimensional (1D) $t$--$J$ models. Here we aim to explore
the combined effects of extended dimensionality and doping by studying ladders
composed of coupled chains of interacting itinerant Fibonacci anyons. We show
analytically that in the limit of strong rung couplings these models can be
mapped onto effective 1D models. These effective models can either be gapped
models of hole pairs, or gapless models described by $t$--$J$ (or modified
$t$--$J$--$V$) chains of Fibonacci anyons, whose spectrum exhibits a
fractionalization into charge and anyon degrees of freedom. By using exact
diagonalizations for two-leg and three-leg ladders, we show that indeed the
doped ladders show exactly the same behavior as that of $t$--$J$ chains. In the
strong ferromagnetic rung limit, we can obtain a new model that hosts two
different kinds of Fibonacci particles - which we denote as the heavy $\tau$'s
and light $\tau$'s. These two particle types carry the same (non-Abelian)
topological charge but different (Abelian) electric charges. Once again, we map
the two-dimensional ladder onto an effective chain carrying these heavy and
light $\tau$'s. We perform a finite size scaling analysis to show the
appearance of gapless modes for certain anyon densities whereas a topological
gapped phase is suggested for another density regime.

of photon zero-momentum modes. The resulting finite volume effects must be
quantitatively understood; and, to this end, non-relativistic effective field
theories are an efficient tool, especially in the case of composite particles.
Recently an oddity related to non-locality of the standard lattice approach was
uncovered by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal collaboration. Explicit
contributions from antiparticles appear to be required so that finite volume
QED results for a point-like fermion can be reproduced in the effective field
theory description. We provide transparency for this argument by considering
point-like scalars and spinors in finite volume QED using the method of
regions. For the more germane case of composite particles, we determine that
antiparticle modes contribute to the finite-volume electromagnetic mass of
composite spinors through terms proportional to the squares of time-like form
factors evaluated at threshold. We extend existing finite volume calculations
to one order higher, which is particularly relevant for the electromagnetic
mass of light nuclei. Additionally, we verify that the analogous finite volume
contributions to the nucleon mass in chiral perturbation theory vanish in

has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,
submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in the
high-redshift Universe traced by their dust emission. A novel method, based on
a component-separation procedure using a combination of Planck and IRAS data,
has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectral
energy distributions peaking between 353 and 857GHz at 5' resolution. A total
of 2151 Planck high-z source candidates (the PHZ) have been detected in the
cleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545GHz above 500mJy. Embedded in
the cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-z
candidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent with
redshifts z>2, assuming a dust temperature of 35K and a spectral index of 1.5.
First follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed that
this list consists of two distinct populations. A small fraction (around 3%) of
the sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensed
star-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects
(with flux density at 545GHz ranging from 350mJy up to 1Jy) at redshift 2 to 4.
However, the vast majority of the PHZ sources appear as overdensities of dusty
star-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z>2, and may be
considered as proto-cluster candidates. The PHZ provides an original sample,
complementary to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich Catalogue; by extending the
population of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sources
at z>1.5, the PHZ may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. Hence the
PHZ opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,
and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

important open question is whether information is merely a useful conceptual
metaphor, or intrinsic to the operation of biological systems. To address this
question, we provide a rigorous case study of the informational architecture of
two representative biological networks: the Boolean network model for the
cell-cycle regulatory network of the fission yeast S. pombe and that of the
budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We compare our results for these biological
networks to the same analysis performed on ensembles of two different types of
random networks. We show that both biological networks share features in common
that are not shared by either ensemble. In particular, the biological networks
in our study, on average, process more information than the random networks.
They also exhibit a scaling relation in information transferred between nodes
that distinguishes them from either ensemble: even when compared to the
ensemble of random networks that shares important topological properties, such
as a scale-free structure. We show that the most biologically distinct regime
of this scaling relation is associated with the dynamics and function of the
biological networks. Information processing in biological networks is therefore
interpreted as an emergent property of topology (causal structure) and dynamics
(function). These results demonstrate quantitatively how the informational
architecture of biologically evolved networks can distinguish them from other
classes of network architecture that do not share the same informational
properties.

procedure can be severely biased by latent confounding factors such as batch
effects and unmeasured covariates that correlate with both primary variable(s)
of interest (e.g. treatment variable, phenotype) and the outcome. Over the past
decade, many statistical methods have been proposed to adjust for the
confounders in hypothesis testing. We unify these methods in the same
framework, generalize them to include multiple primary variables and multiple
nuisance variables, and analyze their statistical properties. In particular, we
provide theoretical guarantees for RUV-4 and LEAPP, which correspond to two
different identification conditions in the framework: the first requires a set
of ""negative controls"" that are known a priori to follow the null distribution;
the second requires the true non-nulls to be sparse. Two different estimators
which are based on RUV-4 and LEAPP are then applied to these two scenarios. We
show that if the confounding factors are strong, the resulting estimators can
be asymptotically as powerful as the oracle estimator which observes the latent
confounding factors. For hypothesis testing, we show the asymptotic z-tests
based on the estimators can control the type I error. Numerical experiments
show that the false discovery rate is also controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure when the sample size is reasonably large.

suggest $\mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{E}$ within the reconnection jet has an analogue

increasing importance of task-level parallelism in high-performance computing,
Pilot-Job systems are also witnessing an adoption beyond traditional domains.
Notwithstanding the growing impact on scientific research, there is no
agreement upon a definition of Pilot-Job system and no clear understanding of
the underlying abstraction and paradigm. Pilot-Job implementations have
proliferated with no shared best practices or open interfaces and little
interoperability. Ultimately, this is hindering the realization of the full
impact of Pilot-Jobs by limiting their robustness, portability, and
maintainability. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of Pilot-Job

Pilot abstraction, its distinguishing logical components and functionalities,
its terminology, and its architecture pattern; and (iii) the description of

For the case of unitary dynamics generated by a time-independent Hamiltonian,
we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on two asymmetry monotones that
guarantees that an arbitrary state of a two-level quantum system or a separable
state of $N$ two-level quantum systems will unitarily evolve to another state
from which it can be distinguished with a fixed minimal error probability
$\delta \in [0,1/2]$. This condition is used to order the set of qubit states
based on their distinguishability time, and to derive an optimal release time
for driven two-level systems such as those that occur, e.g., in the
Landau-Zener problem. For the case of non-unitary dynamics, we compare three
lower bounds to the distinguishability time, including a new type of lower
bound which is formulated in terms of the asymmetry of the uniformly

state of filling p/(2p +1) in a magnetic field of strength B that is
algebraically identical to the IQHE state of filling p in a magnetic field of
strength B/(2p+1). The construction provides a precise definition of the
quasi-electron/composite fermion that differs in some respects from common
descriptions: they are eigenstates of L,Lz; they and the FLL subshells they
occupy carry a third index I that is associated with breaking of scalar pairs;
they absorb in their internal wave functions one, not two, units of magnetic
flux; and they share a common, simple structure as vector products of a spinor
creating an electron and one creating magnetic flux. We argue that these
properties are a consequence of the breaking of the degeneracy of
noninteracting electrons within the FLL by the scale-invariant Coulomb
potential. We discuss the sense in which the wave function construction
supports basic ideas of both composite fermion and hierarchical descriptions of
the FQHE. We describe symmetries of the quasi-electrons at half filling, where
a deep Fermi sea of quasi-electrons forms, and the quasi-electrons take on
Majorana and pseudo-Dirac characters. Finally, we show that the wave functions

producing at half filling an operator that differs from but plays the same role

policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement
learning. The model is based on the deep Q-network, a convolutional neural
network trained with a variant of Q-learning. Its input is raw pixels and its
output is a value function estimating future rewards from taking an action
given a system state. To distribute the deep Q-network training, we adapt the
DistBelief software framework to the context of efficiently training
reinforcement learning agents. As a result, the method is completely
asynchronous and scales well with the number of machines. We demonstrate that
the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as
inputs, was able to achieve reasonable success on a simple game with minimal
parameter tuning.

oscillators with positive and negative couplings under a periodic external
driving field with a bimodal distribution of driving phases. The phase
distribution and the mean speed of the traveling state, as well as the order
parameter for synchronization, are computed as the driving amplitude is varied.
We observe that the periodically-driven system can also host traveling states
for parameters in the same range as those for the case of a system without a
driving field. The traveling speed is found to depend non-monotonically on the
driving amplitude. In particular, oscillators divide into four clusters and
move in pairs. Further, depending on the driving amplitude, two kinds of
traveling mode arise: pairs of clusters traveling in the same direction
(symmetric mode) and in opposite directions (antisymmetric mode). In the latter
case (antisymmetric traveling mode), the average phase speed of the whole
system apparently vanishes. A phenomenological argument for such behavior is
given.

actions. In most action recognition tasks, overlapping feature distribution is
a common problem leading to overfitting. In the subdivision stage of the
proposed SFM, samples in each category are clustered. Then, such samples are
grouped into multiple more concentrated subcategories. Boundaries for the
subcategories are easier to find and as consequence overfitting is avoided. In
the subsequent fusion stage, the multi-subcategories classification results are
converted back to the original category recognition problem. Two methods to
determine the number of clusters are provided. The proposed model has been
thoroughly tested with four popular datasets. In the Hollywood2 dataset, an
accuracy of 79.4% is achieved, outperforming the state-of-the-art accuracy of
64.3%. The performance on the YouTube Action dataset has been improved from
75.8% to 82.5%, while considerably improvements are also observed on the KTH

interactions between the exitonic transitions in the dimer and the plasmons in
the MNP lead to novel effects in the composite's input-output characteristics
for the light intensity and the absorption spectrum, which we study in the
linear and nonlinear regimes. We fnd that the exciton-plasmon hybridization
leads to optical bistability and hysteresis for the one-exciton transition and
enhancement of excitation for the two-exciton transition. The latter leads to a
signifcant decrease of the field strength needed to saturate the system. In the
linear regime, the absortion spectrum has a dispersive (Fano-like) line shape.
The spectral position and shape of this spectrum depend on the detuning of the
dimer's one-exciton resonance relative to the plasmon resonance. Upon
increasing the applied field intensity to the nonlinear regime, the Fano-like
singularities in the absorption spectra are smeared and they disappear due to
the saturation of the dimer, which leads to the MNP dominating the spectrum.
The above effects, for which we provide physical explanations, allow one to
tailor the Fano-like shape of the absorption spectrum, by changing either the
detuning or the input power.

can affect the galaxy LF. To attempt to examine a sample of galaxies that is
relatively free of surface brightness selection effects, we compute the optical
galaxy LF of galaxies detected by the blind HI survey, ALFALFA. We find that
the global LF of the ALFALFA sample is not well fit by a Schechter function,
because of the presence of a wide dip in the LF around $M_r$=-18 and an upturn
at fainter magnitudes ($\alpha$~-1.47). We compare the HI selected r-band LF to
various LFs of optically selected populations to determine where the HI
selected optical LF obtains its shape. We find that sample selection plays a

Bayesian inference via batch, as well as \emph{online} MCMC; the latter allows
scaling up even for \emph{dense} binary data (i.e., when the number of ones in

from the data. We evaluate our model on several large-scale real-world binary

asymptotic variance decreases multiple times for higher values of $\beta$. The

the turbulent velocity field of molecular clouds. CVD is based on centroid
velocities of dense gas clumps, thus is less prone to density fluctuation and
reflects more directly the cloud velocity field. Prior work demonstrated that
the Taurus molecular cloud CVD resembles the well-known Larson's linewidth-size
relation of molecular clouds. In this work, we studied the dependence of the
CVD on the line-of-sight thickness of molecular clouds, a quantity which cannot
be measured by direct means. We produced a simple statistical model of cores
within clouds and analyzed the CVD of a variety of hydrodynamical simulations.
We show that the relation between the CVD and the 2D projected separation of
cores ($L_{2D}$) is sensitive to the cloud thickness. When the cloud is thin,
the index of CVD-$L_{2D}$ relation ($\gamma$ in the relation CVD$\sim
L_{2D}^{\gamma}$) reflects the underlying energy spectrum ($E(k)\sim
k^{-\beta}$) in that $\gamma\sim(\beta-1)/2$. The CVD-$L_{2D}$ relation becomes
flatter ($\gamma\to 0$) for thicker clouds. We used this result to constrain
the thicknesses of Taurus, Perseus, and Ophiuchus. We conclude that Taurus has
a ratio of cloud depth to cloud length smaller than about 1/10-1/8, i.e. it is
a sheet. A simple geometric model fit to the linewidth-size relation indicates
that the Taurus cloud has a $\sim 0.7$ pc line-of-sight dimension. In contrast,
Perseus and Ophiuchus are thicker and have ratios of cloud depth to cloud
length larger than about 1/10-1/8.

quasiparticles interact with a spin resonance at momentum $(\pi,\pi)$. This
interaction is revealed by specific signatures in the quasiparticle
spectroscopies, like kinks in photoemission and dips in tunneling. We study
these signatures, as they appear inside and around a vortex core in the local
density of states (LDOS), a property accessible experimentally by scanning
tunneling spectroscopy. Our model retains the whole nonlocal structure of the
self-energy in space and time and is therefore not amenable to a Hamiltonian
treatment using Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The interaction with the spin
resonance does not suppress the zero-bias peak at the vortex center, although
it reduces its spectral weight; neither does it smear out the vortex LDOS, but
rather it adds structure to it. Some of the signatures we find may have been
already measured in FeSe, but remained unnoticed. We compare the LDOS as a
function of both energy and position with and without coupling to the spin
resonance and observe, in particular, that the quasiparticle interference
patterns around the vortex are strongly damped by the coupling. We study in
detail the transfer of spectral weight induced both locally and globally by the
interaction and also by the formation of the vortex. Finally, we introduce a
new way of imaging the quasiparticles in real space, which combines locality
and momentum-space sensitivity. This approach allows one to access
quasiparticle properties that are not contained in the LDOS.

Chechik [PODC 2013], often have no means to tolerate failures, once the system
has been setup and started. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first
self-healing compact routing scheme. Besides, our schemes are developed for low
memory nodes, i.e., nodes need only $O(\log^2 n)$ memory, and are thus, compact
schemes.
  We introduce two algorithms of independent interest: The first is CompactFT,
a novel compact version (using only $O(\log n)$ local memory) of the
self-healing algorithm Forgiving Tree of Hayes et al. [PODC 2008]. The second
algorithm (CompactFTZ) combines CompactFT with Thorup-Zwick's tree-based
compact routing scheme [SPAA 2001] to produce a fully compact self-healing
routing scheme. In the self-healing model, the adversary deletes nodes one at a
time with the affected nodes self-healing locally by adding few edges.
CompactFT recovers from each attack in only $O(1)$ time and $\Delta$ messages,
with only +3 degree increase and $O(log \Delta)$ graph diameter increase, over
any sequence of deletions ($\Delta$ is the initial maximum degree).
  Additionally, CompactFTZ guarantees delivery of a packet sent from sender s
as long as the receiver t has not been deleted, with only an additional $O(y
\log \Delta)$ latency, where $y$ is the number of nodes that have been deleted
on the path between $s$ and $t$. If $t$ has been deleted, $s$ gets informed and
the packet removed from the network.

instability which increases the effective length of the periphery of the cloud.
Assuming Laplacian growth we give a detailed derivation of the time-dependent
conformal transformation that solves the equation of the \emph{fingering}
instability. For the phase of slower expansion, the evolution of complex poles
with a dynamics largely controlled by the Hilbert operator (acting on the
function that represents the interface position) leads to \emph{cusp}
singularities but smooths out the smaller scale perturbations.
  We review the arguments that the rising column cannot preserve its integrity
(seen as compacity in any horizontal section), because of the penetrative
downdrafts or the incomplete repulsion of the static environmental air through
momentum transfer. Then we propose an analytical framework which is adequate
for competition of two distinct phases of the same system.
  The methods exmined here are formulated in a general framework and can be
easily adapted to particular cases of atmospheric convection.

a population of cells with conceptually based, highly selective activity,
indicating the presence of a sparse neural code. Building off previous work by
the author and J.C. Collins, this paper develops a statistical model for
analyzing this data, based on maximum likelihood analysis. The goal is to infer
the underlying distribution of neural response probabilities across the
population of MTL cells. The response probability, or neuronal sparsity, is
defined as the total probability that the neuron produces an above-threshold
firing rate during the presentation of a randomly selected stimulus. Applying
the method, it is shown that a beta-distributed neuronal sparsity across the
cells of the MTL is consistent with the data. The resulting fits reveal a
sparse and highly skewed code, with a huge majority of neurons exhibiting
extremely low response probabilities, and a smaller minority possessing
considerably higher response probabilities. The distributions are closely
approximated by a power law at low sparsity values. Strikingly similar skewed
distributions have been found in the statistics of place cell activity in rats,
suggesting similar underlying coding dynamics between the human MTL and the rat
hippocampus.

integration schemes we combine two spatial discretizations which are tailored

an unsteady Stokes problem. For the hyperbolic transport problem a spatial
discretization with an Upwind Discontinuous Galerkin method and an explicit
treatment in the time integration scheme is rather natural and allows for an
efficient implementation. The treatment of the Stokes part involves the
solution of linear systems. In this case a discretization with Hybrid
Discontinuous Galerkin methods is better suited. We consider such a
discretization for the Stokes part with two important features:
H(div)-conforming finite elements to garantuee exactly divergence-free velocity
solutions and a projection operator which reduces the number of globally

calculated via solving a linear program. The calculated point represents a
fractional assignment of objects or more generally packages of objects to
agents. In order to implement an expected assignment, the mechanism designer
must decompose the fractional point into integer solutions, each satisfying
underlying constraints. The resulting convex combination can then be viewed as
a probability distribution over feasible assignments out of which a random
assignment can be sampled. This approach has been successfully employed in
combinatorial optimization as well as mechanism design with or without money.
  In this paper, we show that both finding the optimal fractional point as well
as its decomposition into integer solutions can be done at once. We propose an
appropriate linear program which provides the desired solution. We show that
the linear program can be solved via Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition is a direct implementation of the revised simplex method which is
well known to be highly efficient in practice. We also show how to use the
Benders decomposition as an alternative method to solve the problem. The
proposed method can also find a decomposition into integer solutions when the
fractional point is readily present perhaps as an outcome of other algorithms
rather than linear programming. The resulting convex decomposition in this case

from a parasitic parallel channel in virtual substrate. This channel
participates in current passing through the devices and increases parasitic
capacitors which degrades the high frequency response. In this paper a new
approach has been introduced to eliminate the channel which in turn reduces
parasitic capacitors of the MOSFET. It is illustrated that, increasing virtual
substrate doping, can reduce and finally eliminate this unintentional channel.
In this work 2D simulation has been used to investigate the impact of the

of recommending complex objects in hybrid domains, characterized by both
discrete and continuous attributes and constraints defined over them. The
algorithm assumes minimal initial information, i.e., a set of catalog
attributes, and defines decisional features as logic formulae combining Boolean
and algebraic constraints over the attributes. The (unknown) utility of the
decision maker (DM) is modelled as a weighted combination of features. CLEO
iteratively alternates a preference elicitation step, where pairs of candidate
solutions are selected based on the current utility model, and a refinement
step where the utility is refined by incorporating the feedback received. The
elicitation step leverages a Max-SMT solver to return optimal hybrid solutions
according to the current utility model. The refinement step is implemented as
learning to rank, and a sparsifying norm is used to favour the selection of few
informative features in the combinatorial space of candidate decisional
features.
  CLEO is the first preference elicitation algorithm capable of dealing with
hybrid domains, thanks to the use of Max-SMT technology, while retaining
uncertainty in the DM utility and noisy feedback. Experimental results on
complex recommendation tasks show the ability of CLEO to quickly focus towards
optimal solutions, as well as its capacity to recover from suboptimal initial
choices. While no competitors exist in the hybrid setting, CLEO outperforms a
state-of-the-art Bayesian preference elicitation algorithm when applied to a
purely discrete task.

infrared stars, radio recombination lines (RRLs), star formation sites, CO,
high density regions in clouds, and HI. The bump peaks are taken as indications
for arm tangencies, which are close to the real density peaks near the spiral
arm tangency point but often have $\sim$ 1$^\circ$ offset to the interior of
spiral arms. The arm tangencies identified from the longitudes plots for RRLs,
HII regions, methanol masers, CO, high density gas regions, and HI gas appear
nearly the same Galactic longitude, and therefore there is no obvious offset
for spiral arms traced by different gas components. However, we find obvious
displacements of 1.3$^\circ-$ 5.8$^\circ$ between gaseous bump peaks from the
directions of the maximum density of old stars near the tangencies of the
Scutum-Centaurus Arm, the northern part of the Near 3 kpc Arm, and maybe also

Here, we propose a analytical approach based on a meta-graph sketch to examine

abstractions, and draw a comparison with vertex-centric models like Google's

algorithms. This decouples the unwieldy large graph and their partitioning
specific artifacts from their algorithmic analysis. We use 5 spatial and
powerlaw graphs as exemplars, four different partitioning strategies, and
PageRank and Breadth First Search as canonical algorithms. These analysis over
the meta-graphs provide a reliable measure of the expected number of
supersteps, and the communication and computational complexity of the
algorithms for various graphs, and the relative merits of subgraph-centric
models over vertex-centric ones.

Observatory and is used to detect the radio emission of cosmic-ray air showers.
These observations are compared to the data of the surface detector stations of
the Observatory, which provide well-calibrated information on the cosmic-ray
energies and arrival directions. The response of the radio stations in the 30
to 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction of
the incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area is
determined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolated
using a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries due
to interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components.
The spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement of
the energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in the
AERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV air
shower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy
-- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energy
estimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against the
surface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimator
scales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherent
emission. We find an energy resolution of the radio reconstruction of 22% for
the data set and 17% for a high-quality subset containing only events with at
least five radio stations with signal.

exploration of new spatial areas and the exploitation of nearby resources, an
idea which is at the core of scale-free L\'evy search strategies. Here we study
multi-scale random walks as an approximation to the scale- free case and derive
the exact expressions for their mean-first passage times in a one-dimensional
finite domain. This allows us to provide a complete analytical description of
the dynamics driving the asymmetric regime, in which both nearby and faraway
targets are available to the searcher. For this regime, we prove that the
combination of only two movement scales can be enough to outperform both
balistic and L\'evy strategies. This two-scale strategy involves an optimal
discrimination between the nearby and faraway targets, which is only possible
by adjusting the range of values of the two movement scales to the typical
distances between encounters. So, this optimization necessarily requires some
prior information (albeit crude) about targets distances or distributions.
Furthermore, we found that the incorporation of additional (three, four, ...)
movement scales and its adjustment to target distances does not improve further
the search efficiency. This allows us to claim that optimal random search
strategies in the asymmetric regime actually arise through the informed
combination of only two walk scales (related to the exploitative and the
explorative scale, respectively), expanding on the well-known result that
optimal strategies in strictly uninformed scenarios are achieved through L\'evy
paths (or, equivalently, through a hierarchical combination of multiple
scales).

$T_c$ is a long-standing goal in material science. One strategy is engineering
a material at the nanometer scale such that quantum confinement strengthens the
electron pairing, thus increasing the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$, as
was observed for individual nanoparticles. A true phase-coherent SC condensate,
however, can exist only on larger scales and requires a finite phase stiffness
$J$. In the case of coupled aluminium (Al) nanograins, $T_c$ can exceed that of
bulk Al by a factor of three, but despite several proposals the relevant
mechanism at play is not yet understood. Here we use optical spectroscopy on
granular Al to disentangle the evolution of the fundamental SC energy scales,
$\Delta$ and $J$, as a function of grain coupling. Starting from well-coupled
arrays, $\Delta$ grows with progressive grain decoupling, causing the
increasing of $T_c$. As the grain-coupling is further suppressed, $\Delta$
saturates while $T_c$ decreases, concomitantly with a sharp decline of $J$.
This crossover to a phase-driven SC transition is accompanied by an optical gap
persisting above $T_c$. These findings identify granular Al as an ideal
playground to test the basic mechanisms that enhance superconductivity by
nano-inhomogeneity.

in probabilistic models of language. Such models play an important role in
natural language processing tasks such as translation or speech recognition,
but often rely on the simplistic assumption that words are opaque symbols. This
assumption does not fit morphologically complex language well, where words can
have rich internal structure and sub-word elements are shared across distinct
word forms.
  Our approach is to encode basic notions of morphology into the assumptions of
three different types of language models, with the intention that leveraging
shared sub-word structure can improve model performance and help overcome data
sparsity that arises from morphological processes.
  In the context of n-gram language modelling, we formulate a new Bayesian
model that relies on the decomposition of compound words to attain better
smoothing, and we develop a new distributed language model that learns vector
representations of morphemes and leverages them to link together
morphologically related words. In both cases, we show that accounting for word
sub-structure improves the models' intrinsic performance and provides benefits
when applied to other tasks, including machine translation.
  We then shift the focus beyond the modelling of word sequences and consider
models that automatically learn what the sub-word elements of a given language
are, given an unannotated list of words. We formulate a novel model that can
learn discontiguous morphemes in addition to the more conventional contiguous
morphemes that most previous models are limited to. This approach is
demonstrated on Semitic languages, and we find that modelling discontiguous
sub-word structures leads to improvements in the task of segmenting words into
their contiguous morphemes.

distribution of metals in the Centaurus cluster, combined with the need to
balance the rate of gas cooling with the rate of heat dissipated by the gas
motions. We find that these two methods of constraining the velocity and length

investigated, considering downlink communication. The system comprises of a
Multiple-Input-Single-Output (MISO) incumbent transmitter (TX) - receiver (RX)
pair, which offers a spectrum sharing opportunity to a MISO licensee TX-RX
pair. Our main contribution is the design of a coordinated transmission scheme,
inspired by the underlay Cognitive Radio (CR) approach, with the aim of
maximizing the average rate of the licensee, subject to an average rate
constraint for the incumbent. In contrast to most prior works on underlay CR,
the coordination of the two TXs takes place under a realistic Channel State
Information (CSI) scenario, where each TX has sole access to the instantaneous
direct channel of its served terminal. Such a CSI knowledge setting brings
about a formulation based on the theory of Team Decisions, whereby the TXs aim
at optimizing a common objective given the same constraint set, on the basis of
individual channel information. Consequently, a novel set of applicable
precoding schemes is proposed. Relying on statistical coordination criteria,
the two TXs cooperate in the lack of any instantaneous CSI exchange. We verify
by simulations that our novel coordinated precoding scheme outperforms the
standard underlay CR approach.

results for the Witten diagrams of higher-spin exchanges. This is facilitated
by establishing the conformal block expansions of both the boundary four-point

deep network approaches provide great advantages in terms of learning power and
speed, but previously it has been unclear how to use them to separate signals
in a class-independent way. In contrast, spectral clustering approaches are
flexible with respect to the classes and number of items to be segmented, but
it has been unclear how to leverage the learning power and speed of deep
networks. To obtain the best of both worlds, we use an objective function that
to train embeddings that yield a low-rank approximation to an ideal pairwise
affinity matrix, in a class-independent way. This avoids the high cost of
spectral factorization and instead produces compact clusters that are amenable
to simple clustering methods. The segmentations are therefore implicitly
encoded in the embeddings, and can be ""decoded"" by clustering. Preliminary
experiments show that the proposed method can separate speech: when trained on
spectrogram features containing mixtures of two speakers, and tested on
mixtures of a held-out set of speakers, it can infer masking functions that
improve signal quality by around 6dB. We show that the model can generalize to
three-speaker mixtures despite training only on two-speaker mixtures. The
framework can be used without class labels, and therefore has the potential to
be trained on a diverse set of sound types, and to generalize to novel sources.
We hope that future work will lead to segmentation of arbitrary sounds, with
extensions to microphone array methods as well as image segmentation and other
domains.

manipulation of the spin of a single electron trapped in a quantum dot are now
well established. Combined with the recent control of the displacement of
individual electrons between two distant quantum dots, these achievements
permit to envision the realization of spintronic protocols at the single
electron level. Here, we demonstrate that spin information carried by one or
two electrons can be transferred between two quantum dots separated by a
distance of 4 micrometers with a classical fidelity of 65 %. We show that it is
presently limited by spin flips occurring during the transfer procedure prior
to and after the electron displacement. Being able to encode and control
information in the spin degree of freedom of a single electron while being
transferred over distances of a few microns on nanosecond timescales paves the
way towards ""quantum spintronics"" devices where large scale spin-based quantum
information processing could be implemented.

theory and molecular dynamics simulation. In this situation, there is a global
electrostatic coupling between the surface charges on the walls and the
polarization in the bulk. Then, the correlation function of the polarization
density $p_z(r)$ along the applied field contains a homogeneous part inversely
proportional to the cell volume $V$. Accounting for the long-range dipolar

initiated contributions starting at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ in the
fixed-order expansion. Based on the factorization framework for massless quarks
in Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), we construct a variable flavor
number scheme that deals with arbitrary hierarchies between the mass scale and
the kinematic scales exhibiting a continuous behavior between the massless

show that the threshold matching corrections for all gauge invariant components

explicitly demonstrated by recalculating the known threshold correction for the
parton distribution function at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2 C_F T_F)$ within SCET.
The latter contains large rapidity logarithms $\sim \ln(1-x)$ that can be
summed by exponentiation. Their coefficients are universal which can be used to
obtain potentially relevant higher order results for generic threshold
corrections at colliders from computations in deep inelastic scattering. In
particular, we extract the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ threshold correction

An important limitation of OAuth is the fact that it was designed for

providing federated identity management and user authentication. OpenID Connect

Microsoft, AOL and PayPal are already using it in their web applications [1],
[2], [3], [30].
  In this paper we describe the OpenID Connect protocol and provide the first
in-depth analysis of one of the key features of OpenID Connect: the Discovery

OpenID Connect that belong to the category of second-order vulnerabilities.
These attacks consist of two phases: First, the injection payload is stored by
the legitimate application. Later on, this payload is used in a
security-critical operation. Our new class of attacks - called Malicious
Endpoints attacks - exploits the OpenID Connect extensions Discovery and
Dynamic Registration. These attacks break user authentication, compromise user
privacy, and enable Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), client-side code
injection, and Denial-of-Service (DoS). As a result, the security of the OpenID
Connect protocol cannot be guaranteed when these extensions are enabled in
their present form.
  We contacted the authors of the OpenID Connect and OAuth specifications. They
acknowledged our Malicious Endpoint attacks and recognized the need to improve
the specification [29]. We are currently involved in the discussion regarding
the mitigation of the existing issues and an extension to the OAuth

time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of
hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of
variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible.
They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical
distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of
parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple
linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems.
We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is
larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives
ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these
estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates
of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (\textit{Ursus maritimus})
result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential
solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters.
While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge
ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before
drawing ecological conclusions from their results.

existing cascade learning algorithms are designed by assigning detection rate
and false positive rate to each stage either dynamically or statically. Their
objective functions are not directly related to minimum computation cost. These

minimizing computation cost. On the assumption that a strong classifier is

it iCascade) which iteratively partitions the strong classifiers into two parts

number ri of weak classifiers of each stage i by directly minimizing the
computation cost of the cascade. Theorems are provided to guarantee the
existence of the unique optimal solution. Theorems are also given for the
proposed efficient algorithm of searching optimal parameters ri. Once a new
stage is added, the parameter ri for each stage decreases gradually as
iteration proceeds, which we call decreasing phenomenon. Moreover, with the
goal of minimizing computation cost, we develop an effective algorithm for
setting the optimal threshold of each stage classifier. In addition, we prove

properties of vacancies and hydrogen adsorbates on trilayer graphene. Those
defects are found to share similar low-energy electronic features, since they
both remove a pz electron from the honeycomb lattice and induce a defect level
near the Fermi energy. However, a vacancy also leaves unpaired $\sigma $
electrons on the lattice, which lead to important structural differences and
also contribute to magnetism. We explore both ABA and ABC stackings and compare
properties such as formation energies, magnetic moments, spin density and the
local density of states (LDOS) of the defect levels. These properties show a
strong sensitivity to the layer in which the defect is placed and smaller
sensitivities to sublattice placing and stacking type. Finally, for the ABC
trilayer, we also study how these states behave in the presence of an external
field, which opens a tunable gap in the band structure of the non-defective
system. The pz defect states show a strong hybridization with band states as
the field increases, with reduction and eventually loss of magnetization, and a
non-magnetic, midgap-like state is found when the defect is at the middle
layer.

long-range effects such as order parameters, a powerful method to compute the

possibility of studying various phase transitions at finite temperature in the

a dynamical gauge symmetry breaking via an In\""on\""u-Wigner contraction in its

Lorentz algebra with the emergency of the local Lorentz symmetries and the
gauge fields being identified with a vierbein and a spin connection. As a
result, gravity is described as an effective Einstein-Cartan-like theory with
ultraviolet correction terms and a propagating torsion field. We show that the

research problem in Machine Intelligence. Normally consensus clustering
algorithms take into account the entire ensemble of clustering, where there is
a tendency of generating a very large size ensemble before computing its

select few partitions in the ensemble without compromising on the quality of
the consensus. This may result in an efficient consensus computation technique
and may save unnecessary computational overheads. The ensemble selection
problem addresses this issue of consensus clustering. In this paper, we propose
an efficient method of ensemble selection for a large ensemble. We prioritize
the partitions in the ensemble based on diversity and frequency. Our method
selects top K of the partitions in order of priority, where K is decided by the
user. We observe that considering jointly the diversity and frequency helps in
identifying few representative partitions whose consensus is qualitatively
better than the consensus of the entire ensemble. Experimental analysis on a

discuss about the possibility of increasing this flux a thousand-fold by
exploiting high repetition rate self-seeded pulses at the European XFEL. Here
we report on a feasibility study for an optimized configuration of the SASE2
beamline at the European XFEL which combines self-seeding and undulator
tapering techniques in order to increase the average spectral flux at $14.4$
keV. In particular, we propose to perform monochromatization at $7.2$ keV with
the help of self-seeding, and amplify the seed in the first part of output
undulator. The amplification process can be stopped at a position well before
saturation, where the electron beam gets considerable bunching at the 2nd
harmonic of the coherent radiation. A second part of the output undulator
follows, tuned to the 2nd harmonic frequency, i.e. at $14.4$ keV and is used to
obtain saturation at this energy. One can further prolong the exchange of
energy between the photon and the electron beam by tapering the last part of
the output undulator. We performed start-to-end simulations and demonstrate
that self-seeding, combined with undulator tapering, allows one to achieve more
than a hundred-fold increase in average spectral flux compared with the nominal
SASE regime at saturation, resulting in a maximum flux of order $10^{13}$
photons per second in a meV bandwidth.

self-consistent three dimensional radiative transfer code. We provide an AGN
library of spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Its purpose is to quickly
obtain estimates of the basic parameters of the AGN, such as the intrinsic
luminosity of the central source, the viewing angle, the inner radius, the
volume filling factor and optical depth of the clouds, and the optical depth of
the disk midplane, and to predict the flux at yet unobserved wavelengths. The
procedure is simple and consists of finding an element in the library that
matches the observations. We discuss the general properties of the models and
in particular the 10mic. silicate band. The AGN library accounts well for the
observed scatter of the feature strengths and wavelengths of the peak emission.
AGN extinction curves are discussed and we find that there is no direct
one-to-one link between the observed extinction and the wavelength dependence
of the dust cross sections. We show that objects of the library cover the
observed range of mid IR colors of known AGN. The validity of the approach is
demonstrated by matching the SEDs of a number of representative objects: Four
Seyferts and two quasars for which we present new Herschel photometry, two

(HST) has revealed a remarkable population of galaxies hosting dwarf Seyfert
nuclei with an unusually large broad-line region (BLR). These objects are
remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the size of the BLR can, in some cases,
rival those seen in the most luminous quasars. Secondly, the size of the BLR is
not correlated with the central continuum luminosity, an observation that
distinguishes them from their reverberating counterparts. Collectively, these
early results suggest that non-reverberating dwarf Seyferts are a heterogeneous
group and not simply scaled versions of each other. Careful inspection reveals
broad H Balmer emission lines with single peaks, double peaks, and a
combination of the two, suggesting that the broad emission lines are produced
in kinematically distinct regions centered on the black hole (BH). Because the
gravitational field strength is already known for these objects, by virtue of
knowing their BH mass, the relationship between velocity and radius may be
established, given a kinematic model for the BLR gas. In this way, one can
determine the inner and outer radii of the BLRs by modeling the shape of their
broad emission line profiles. In the present contribution, high quality spectra
obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) are used to
constrain the size of the BLR in the dwarf Seyfert nuclei of M81, NGC 3998, NGC

develop such a model atom and we study the general formation properties of the
C II lines. We find that a nine-level model atom of C I-C III with the
transitions treated assuming complete frequency redistribution (CRD) suffices
to describe the 133.5 nm lines. 3D scattering effects are important for the
intensity in the core of the line. The lines are formed in the optically thick
regime. The core intensity is formed in layers where the temperature is about
10kK at the base of the transition region. The lines are 1.2-4 times wider than
the atomic absorption profile due to the formation in the optically thick
regime. The smaller opacity broadening happens for single peak intensity
profiles where the chromospheric temperature is low with a steep source
function increase into the transition region, the larger broadening happens
when there is a temperature increase from the photosphere to the low
chromosphere leading to a local source function maximum and a double peak
intensity profile with a central reversal. Assuming optically thin formation
with the standard coronal approximation leads to several errors: Neglecting
photoionization severly underestimates the amount of C II at temperatures below
16kK, erroneously shifts the formation from 10kK to 25kK and leads to too low

charged particles would provide a significant probe of physics beyond the
standard model. Any measurably large EDM would imply violation of both time
reversal and parity conservation, with implications for the matter/anti-matter
imbalance of the universe, not currently understood within the standard model.
A frequency domain (i.e. difference of frequencies) method is proposed for
measuring the EDM of electrons or protons or, with modifications, deuterons.
Anticipated precision (i.e. reproducibility) is $10^{-30}\,$e-cm for the proton
EDM, with comparable accuracy (i.e. including systematic error). This would be
almost six orders of magnitude smaller than the present upper limit, and will
provide a stringent test of the standard model.
  Resonant polarimetry, made practical by the large polarized beam charge, is
the key (most novel, least proven) element of the method. Along with the
phase-locked, rolling polarization ""Koop spin wheel,"" resonant polarimetry
measures beam polarization as amplitude rather than as intensity.
  The polarization roll, at 100\,Hz for example, and adjustable by a constant
control current, causes spurious torques due to field errors to average to zero
to high accuracy. Since these torques have been considered to be the dominant
source of systematic error in truly frozen spin operation, this is a major
improvement resulting from the rolling polarization. Important sources of
systematic errors remain, the main one being due to Wien filter reversal
uncertainty.
  Both electron and proton spins can be ""frozen"" in all-electric storage rings,
and their EDM precisions should be comparable. Freezing the deuteron spin
requires a superimposed electric and magnetic guide field; otherwise the
rolling spin method and precision should be similar.

projection effects will be an important complicating factor in interpreting
future Astro-H measurements. To study these effects in detail, we performed an
analysis of the velocity field from simulations of a galaxy cluster
experiencing gas sloshing, and generated synthetic X-ray spectra, convolved
with model Astro-H Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) responses. We find that the
sloshing motions produce velocity signatures that will be observable by Astro-H
in nearby clusters: the shifting of the line centroid produced by the
fast-moving cold gas underneath the front surface, and line broadening produced
by the smooth variation of this motion along the line of sight. The line shapes
arising from inviscid or strongly viscous simulations are very similar,
indicating that placing constraints on the gas viscosity from these
measurements will be difficult. Our spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that,
for adequate exposures, Astro-H will be able to recover the first two moments
of the velocity distribution of these motions accurately, and in some cases
multiple velocity components may be discerned. The simulations also confirm the
importance of accurate treatment of PSF scattering in the interpretation of
Astro-H/SXS spectra of cluster plasmas.

of grains with sizes above 0.5 {\mu}m. We aim to analyze 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m
coreshine from molecular cloud cores to probe the largest grains in the size
distribution. We analyzed dedicated deep Cycle 9 Spitzer IRAC observations in
the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m bands for a sample of 10 low-mass cores. We used a new
modeling approach based on a combination of ratios of the two background- and
foreground-subtracted surface brightnesses and observed limits of the optical
depth. The dust grains were modeled as ice-coated silicate and carbonaceous
spheres. We discuss the impact of local radiation fields with a spectral slope
differing from what is seen in the DIRBE allsky maps. For the cores L260,
ecc806, L1262, L1517A, L1512, and L1544, the model reproduces the data with
maximum grain sizes around 0.9, 0.5, 0.65, 1.5, 0.6, and > 1.5 {\mu}m,
respectively. The maximum coreshine intensities of L1506C, L1439, and L1498 in
the individual bands require smaller maximum grain sizes than derived from the
observed distribution of band ratios. Additional isotropic local radiation
fields with a spectral shape differing from the DIRBE map shape do not remove
this discrepancy. In the case of Rho Oph 9, we were unable to reliably
disentangle the coreshine emission from background variations and the strong
local PAH emission. Considering surface brightness ratios in the 3.6 and 4.5
{\mu}m bands across a molecular cloud core is an effective method of
disentangling the complex interplay of structure and opacities when used in
combination with observed limits of the optical depth.

It is therefore interesting to explore alternatives to the simplest scenario,
in particular by assuming a more general framework where the fluid responsible
of the accelerated expansion is characterised by a time-dependant equation of
state. Usually these models, dubbed dark energy models, are purely
phenomenological, but in this work we concentrate on a theoretically justified
model, the ghost dark energy model. Within the framework of the spherical
collapse model, we evaluate effects of dark energy perturbations both at the
linear and non-linear level and transfer these results into an observable
quantity, the mass function, by speculatively taking into account contributions
of dark energy to the mass of the halos. We showed that the growth rate is
higher in ghost models and that perturbations enhance the number of structures
with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, with stronger effects when the total
mass takes into account dark energy clumps.

requirement to continuously adapt enterprise applications (EAs) to changes in
the business environment. As of today, DevOps concepts have been primarily
introduced to ensure a constant flow of features and bug fixes into new
releases from a functional perspective. In order to integrate a non-functional
perspective into these DevOps concepts this report focuses on tools,
activities, and processes to ensure one of the most important quality
attributes of a software system, namely performance.
  Performance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of
resources. Common metrics are response time, throughput, and resource
utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper
and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In
order to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are
required during development and operation of these systems as well as during
the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically
summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas
activities during operations are called Application Performance Management
(APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but
the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration
between both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to
support this integration as well as open research challenges in this area.

extraordinary period from September 6, 2011 and January 15, 2015 when the Swiss
National Bank enforced a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro.
Based on the analogy between Brownian motion in finance and physics, the
first-order effect of such a steric constraint would enter a priori in the form
of a repulsive entropic force associated with the paths crossing the barrier
that are forbidden. Non-parametric empirical estimates of drift and volatility
show that the predicted first-order analogy between economics and physics are
incorrect. The clue is to realise that the random walk nature of financial
prices results from the continuous anticipations of traders about future
opportunities, whose aggregate actions translate into an approximate efficient
market with almost no arbitrage opportunities. With the Swiss National Bank
stated commitment to enforce the barrier, traders's anticipation of this action
leads to a vanishing drift together with a volatility of the exchange rate that
depends on the distance to the barrier. We give direct quantitative empirical
evidence that this effect is well described by Krugman's target zone model
[P.R. Krugman. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106(3):669-682, 1991].
Motivated by the insights from this economical model, we revise the initial
economics-physics analogy and show that, within the context of hindered
diffusion, the two systems can be described with the same mathematics after
all. Using a recently proposed extended analogy in terms of a colloidal
Brownian particle embedded in a fluid of molecules associated with the
underlying order book, we derive that, close to the restricting boundary, the
dynamics of both systems is described by a stochastic differential equation
with a very small constant drift and a linear diffusion coefficient.

observations combine SN samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of a
single sample and increase the overall sample size. The inhomogeneous
photometric calibration between different SN samples is one of the largest
systematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. To place
these different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observations
of a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $HST$ system. We propose
a complementary method, called `Supercal', in which we use measurements of
secondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the same
stars in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) system, and determine offsets for each system
relative to PS1, placing all SN observations on a single, consistent
photometric system. PS1 has observed $3\pi$ of the sky and has a relative
calibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\sim15<griz<21$ mag), making it an
ideal reference system. We use this process to recalibrate optical observations
taken by the following SN samples: PS1, SNLS, SDSS, CSP, and CfA1-4. We measure
discrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various optical
passbands. We find that correcting for these differences changes recovered
values for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average
$2.6\%$. This change is roughly half the size of current statistical
constraints on $w$. The size of this effect strongly depends on the error in
the $B-V$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. The Supercal method will allow
future analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.

vectors associated with each composition, thus considering the position of each
observation with respect to time. The Dynamic Time Warping allows us to compute
the distance between two pieces and to show that our approach distinguishes
well the examples that we took into account, exhibiting a strong indication

thermo-chemical processes are still tracked on the refined elements. Such an
