an inefficient decision making unit (DMU) is determined at its projected point
on the efficient frontier. Under the occurrences of multiple projection points,
however, this evaluation procedure is not precise and may lead to erroneous
inferences as to the RTS possibilities of DMUs. To circumvent this, the current
communication first defines the RTS of an inefficient DMU at its projected
point that lies in the relative interior of the minimum face. Based on this
definition, it proposes an algorithm by extending the latest developed method
of measuring RTS via the CCR model. The main advantage of our proposed
algorithm lies in its computational efficiency.

equation have become a popular method for the study of stochastic effects in
chemical reaction systems. Several different MA methods have been proposed and
applied in the literature, but it remains unclear how they perform with respect
to each other. In this paper we study the normal, Poisson, log-normal and
central-moment-neglect MAs by applying them to understand the stochastic
properties of chemical systems whose deterministic rate equations show the
properties of bistability, ultrasensitivity and oscillatory behaviour. Our
results suggest that the normal MA is favourable over the other studied MAs. In
particular we found that (i) the size of the region of parameter space where a
closure gives physically meaningful results, e.g. positive mean and variance,
is considerably larger for the normal closure than for the other three
closures; (ii) the accuracy of the predictions of the four closures (relative
to simulations using the stochastic simulation algorithm) is comparable in
those regions of parameter space where all closures give physically meaningful
results; (iii) the Poisson and log-normal MAs are not uniquely defined for
systems involving conservation laws in molecule numbers. We also describe the
new software package MOCA which enables the automated numerical analysis of
various MA methods in a graphical user interface and which was used to perform
the comparative analysis presented in this paper. MOCA allows the user to
develop novel closure methods and can treat polynomial, non-polynomial, as well
as time-dependent propensity functions, thus being applicable to virtually any
chemical reaction system.

membrane potential ($V_m$). We find that these ""ephaptic interactions"" are
small but not negligible. The model neural population can generate $V_e$ with
millivolt-scale amplitude and this $V_e$ perturbs the $V_m$ of ""nearby"" cables
and effectively increases their electrotonic length. After using passive cable
theory to systematically study ephaptic coupling, we explore a test case: the
medial superior olive (MSO) in the auditory brainstem. The MSO is a possible
locus of ephaptic interactions: sounds evoke large $V_e$ in vivo in this
nucleus (millivolt-scale). The $V_e$ response is thought to be generated by MSO
neurons that perform a known neuronal computation with submillisecond temporal
precision (coincidence detection to encode sound source location). Using a
biophysically-based model of MSO neurons, we find millivolt-scale ephaptic

spike time synchrony, and time difference sensitivity. These results suggest

spin-polarized fractional quantum Hall states, and also estimate the effect of
Landau level mixing using the modified interaction pseudopotentials given in
the literature. We find that the observed phase diagram is in good quantitative
agreement with theory that neglects Landau level mixing, but the agreement
becomes significantly worse when Landau level mixing is incorporated assuming
that the corrections to the energies are linear in the Landau level mixing
parameter $\lambda$. This implies that a first order perturbation theory in
$\lambda$ is inadequate for the current experimental systems, for which
$\lambda$ is typically on the order of or greater than one. We also test the
accuracy of the composite-fermion theory and find that all lowest Landau level
projection methods used in the literature are very accurate for the states of
the form $n/(2n+1)$ but for the states at $n/(2n-1)$ the results are more
sensitive to the projection method. An earlier prediction of an absence of spin
transitions for the $n/(4n+1)$ states is confirmed by more rigorous

$K_3$-WORM colorable graphs which have a $K_3$-WORM coloring with two colors

FeAs planes, parallel to the modulation direction of the spin stripes. However,
recent experiments in hole-doped iron pnictides have observed a reorientation
of the magnetic moments from in-plane to out-of-plane. Interestingly, this
reorientation is accompanied by a change in the magnetic ground state from a
stripe antiferromagnet to a tetragonal non-uniform magnetic configuration.
Motivated by these recent observations, here we investigate the origin of the
spin anisotropy in iron pnictides using an itinerant microscopic electronic
model that respects all the symmetry properties of a single FeAs plane. We find
that the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the Hund's rule coupling
can account for the observed spin anisotropies, including the spin
reorientation in hole-doped pnictides, without the need to invoke orbital or
nematic order. Our calculations also reveal an asymmetry between the magnetic
ground states of electron- and hole-doped compounds, with only the latter
displaying tetragonal magnetic states.

successfully measure the nonlinear bias to an accuracy of $\sim 5$% at $k<0.6

successfully removes a large parameter degeneracy when constraining the linear
growth rate of structure. We carry out a joint parameter estimation, using the

simply from different methods of populating halos with galaxies. We find a
prominent turnaround scale, at which RSD damping effects are greater then the
nonlinear growth, which differs not only for each $\mu$ bin but also for each

multiple stellar populations in globular clusters and cast many hard challenges
for the study of the formation and dynamical history of these stellar systems.
In this Letter we present the results of a study of the kinematic properties of
multiple populations in NGC 2808 based on high-precision Hubble Space Telescope
proper-motion measurements. In a recent study, Milone et al. have identified
five distinct populations (A, B, C, D, and E) in NGC 2808. Populations D and E
coincide with the helium-enhanced populations in the middle and the blue main
sequences (mMS and bMS) previously discovered by Piotto et al.; populations A,
B, and C correspond to the redder main sequence (rMS) that in the Piotto et al.
was associated with the primordial stellar population. Our analysis shows that,
in the outermost regions probed (between about 1.5 and 2 times the cluster
half-light radius), the velocity distribution of populations D and E is
radially anisotropic (the deviation from an isotropic distribution is
significant at the ~3.5-sigma level). Stars of populations D and E have a
smaller tangential velocity dispersion than those of populations A, B, and C,
while no significant differences are found in the radial-velocity dispersion.
We present the results of a numerical simulation showing that the observed
differences between the kinematics of these stellar populations are consistent
with the expected kinematic fingerprint of the diffusion towards the cluster
outer regions of stellar populations initially more centrally concentrated.

we study the profile of one-step martingale plans $\pi$ on $\R^d\times \R^d$

martingales having $\mu$ and $\nu$ as marginals. While there is a great deal of
results for the real line (i.e., when $d=1$), much less is known in the richer
and more delicate higher dimensional case that we tackle in this paper. We show
that many structural results can be obtained whenever a natural dual
optimization problem is attained, provided the initial measure $\mu$ is
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. One such a property
is that $\mu$-almost every $x$ in $\R^d$ is transported by the optimal
martingale plan into a probability measure $\pi_x$ concentrated on the extreme
points of the closed convex hull of its support. This will be established in
full generality in the 2-dimensional case, and also for any $d\geq 3$ as long
as the marginals are in ""subharmonic order"". In some cases, $\pi_x$ is
supported on the vertices of a $k(x)$-dimensional polytope, such as when the
target measure is discrete. Many of the proofs rely on a remarkable
decomposition of ""martingale supporting"" Borel subsets of $\R^d\times \R^d$
into a collection of mutually disjoint components by means of a ""convex paving""
of the source space. If the martingale is optimal, then each of the components
in the decomposition supports a restricted optimal martingale transport for
which the dual problem is attained. These decompositions are used to obtain
structural results in cases where duality is not attained. On the other hand,
they can also be related to higher dimensional Nikodym sets. %On the other
hand, they can also lead to natural and intriguing constructions of higher
dimensional Nikodym sets.

anisotropic (weighted) multi-index sets are explored, and rigorous proofs
reveal sharp asymptotic error estimates in which we achieve sub-exponential

useful in precise tests of the weak charged current at Belle II. In these
decays, leptonic $\mathbf{T}$-odd correlations in triple products of spin and
momenta --which may signal time reversal violation in the leptonic sector-- are
suppressed by the tiny neutrino masses. Therefore, a measurement of such

flavor violating (LFV) decays, where this effect is not extremely suppressed.

different models that can be used to describe an effective (time-dependent)

evolution obtained for each model shows that it can be used for distinguishing
between all four models. We calculate next the $\omega(\Lambda)$ frequencies
for quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild-de Sitter
black holes at different redshifts. Considering that the variation of $\Lambda$
happens on cosmological timescales, the combined $\omega(\Lambda(z))$ could be
used in principle to track the evolution of the cosmological constant. We
quantify the resulting minute frequency shift in the quasinormal mode
frequencies and show that the relative frequency shift grows as $M^2$. However,
even in a most optimistic scenario with an extremely high mass supermassive
black hole there is no prospect for the detection of this effect.

minimizing environmental impacts, we optimize descent trajectory with respect
to two cost functionals: fuel and emissions cost. We analyze both singular arc

the optimal trajectory is generated by the backward and forward integration.
The trajectory from the proposed algorithm is compared to the numerical optimal

STO/3 unit cells of GTO]$_{20}$ using a unique array of photoemission
techniques including soft and hard x-ray excitation, soft x-ray angle-resolved
photoemission, core-level spectroscopy, resonant excitation, and standing-wave
effects, as well as theoretical calculations of the electronic structure at
several levels and of the actual photoemission process. Standing-wave
measurements below and above a strong resonance have been introduced as a

characterized the spatial and momentum properties of this 2DEG with
unprecedented detail, determining via depth-distribution measurements that it
is spread throughout the 6 u.c. layer of STO, and measuring the momentum
dispersion of its states. The experimental results are supported in several
ways by theory, leading to a much more complete picture of the nature of this

there are still many matrices for which preconditioners are lacking, in
particular in cases where the size of the matrix $N$ becomes very large. There
remains hence a great need to develop general purpose preconditioners whose
cost scales well with the matrix size $N$. In this paper, we propose a
preconditioner with broad applicability and with cost $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for
dense matrices, when the matrix is given by a smooth kernel. Extending the
method using the same framework to general $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices is
relatively straightforward. These preconditioners have a controlled accuracy
(machine accuracy can be achieved if needed) and scale linearly with $N$. They
are based on an approximate direct solve of the system. The linear scaling of
the algorithm is achieved by means of two key ideas. First, the
$\mathcal{H}^2$-structure of the dense matrix is exploited to obtain an
extended sparse system of equations. Second, fill-ins arising when performing
the elimination are compressed as low-rank matrices if they correspond to
well-separated interactions. This ensures that the sparsity pattern of the
extended sparse matrix is preserved throughout the elimination, hence resulting
in a very efficient algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(N \log(1/\varepsilon)^2 )$
computational cost and $\mathcal{O}(N \log 1/\varepsilon )$ memory requirement,
for an error tolerance $0 < \varepsilon < 1$. The solver is inexact, although
the error can be controlled and made as small as needed. These solvers are
related to ILU in the sense that the fill-in is controlled. However, in ILU,
most of the fill-in is simply discarded whereas here it is approximated using
low-rank blocks, with a prescribed tolerance. Numerical examples are discussed
to demonstrate the linear scaling of the method and to illustrate its
effectiveness as a preconditioner.

of BCS, dictionary learning, a.k.a. sparse coding, has been studied as a matrix
factorization problem where its sample complexity, uniqueness and
identifiability have been addressed thoroughly. However, in spite of the strong
connections between BCS and sparse coding, recent results from the sparse
coding problem area have not been exploited within the context of BCS. In
particular, prior BCS efforts have focused on learning constrained and complete
dictionaries that limit the scope and utility of these efforts. In this paper,
we develop new theoretical bounds for perfect recovery for the general
unconstrained BCS problem. These unconstrained BCS bounds cover the case of
overcomplete dictionaries, and hence, they go well beyond the existing BCS
theory. Our perfect recovery results integrate the combinatorial theories of

practical recovery bounds for BCS. Moreover, we discuss the performance of BCS

paradigm used to successfully explain the electronic and magnetic properties of

spin-orbit coupling (SOC), in the limit of increased bandwidth and reduced
electron correlation, drives the formation of novel electronic states, as
manifested through the existence of metal-insulator transitions (MITs). SOC is
believed to play a dominant role in 5d5 systems such as iridates (Ir4+),
undergoing MITs which may or may not be intimately connected to magnetic order,
with pyrochlore and perovksite systems being examples of the former and latter,
respectively. However, the role of SOC for other 5d configurations is less
clear. For example, 5d3 (e.g Os5+) systems are expected to have an orbital
singlet and consequently a reduced effect of SOC in the groundstate. The
pyrochlore osmate Cd2Os2O7 nonetheless exhibits a MIT intimately entwined with
magnetic order with phenomena similar to pyrochlore iridates. Here we report
the first resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on an osmium
compound, allowing us to determine the salient electronic and magnetic energy
scales controlling the MIT in Cd2Os2O7, which we benchmark against detailed

MIT of a magnetic excitation corresponding to a superposition of multiple
spin-flip processes from an Ising-like all-in/all-out magnetic groundstate. We

its own causal source; there is photon noise, stochastic source variability,
and residuals coming from imperfect calibration of the detector or telescope.
The precision of NASA Kepler photometry for exoplanet science---the most
precise photometric measurements of stars ever made---appears to be limited by
unknown or untracked variations in spacecraft pointing and temperature, and
unmodeled stellar variability. Here we present the Causal Pixel Model (CPM) for
Kepler data, a data-driven model intended to capture variability but preserve
transit signals. The CPM works at the pixel level so that it can capture very
fine-grained information about the variation of the spacecraft. The CPM
predicts each target pixel value from a large number of pixels of other stars
sharing the instrument variabilities while not containing any information on
possible transits in the target star. In addition, we use the target star's
future and past (auto-regression). By appropriately separating, for each data
point, the data into training and test sets, we ensure that information about
any transit will be perfectly isolated from the model. The method has four
hyper-parameters (the number of predictor stars, the auto-regressive window
size, and two L2-regularization amplitudes for model components), which we set
by cross-validation. We determine a generic set of hyper-parameters that works
well for most of the stars and apply the method to a corresponding set of
target stars. We find that we can consistently outperform (for the purposes of
exoplanet detection) the Kepler Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) method for
exoplanet discovery.

hole is investigated in core collapse supernova simulations in the general
relativistic one dimensional code using the BHB$\Lambda \phi$ and HShen

Woosley and Heger \citep{Woos}. Radial profiles of the mass fractions of
baryons, the density as well as the temperature in the PNS at different moments
in time, are compared for both EoS tables. The behaviour of the central density
of the PNS with time is demonstrated for those two $\Lambda$ hyperon EoS tables
and compared with their corresponding nuclear EoS tables. It is observed that
the black hole formation time is higher in the BHB$\Lambda \phi$ case than in
the HShen $\Lambda$ EoS for the entire set of progenitor models adopted here,
because the repulsive $\Lambda$-$\Lambda$ interaction makes the BHB$\Lambda
\phi$ EoS stiffer. Neutrino emission with the $\Lambda$ hyperon EoS ceases
earlier than that of its nuclear counterpart. The long duration evolution of
the shock radius and gravitational mass of the PNS after a successful supernova
explosion with enhanced neutrino heating are studied with the BHB$\Lambda \phi$
EoS and $s$20WH07 progenitor model. The PNS is found to remain stable for 4 s
and might evolve into a cold neutron star.

characterize the Hamiltonian I-graphs, a further generalization of generalized
Petersen graphs. The characterization of Hamiltonian I-graphs follows from the
fact that one can choose a 1-factor in any I-graph in such a way that the
corresponding associated quartic graph is a graph bundle having a cycle graph
as base graph and a fiber and the fundamental factorization of graph bundles
playing the role of blue and red factorization. The techniques that we develop
allow us to represent Cayley multigraphs of degree 4, that are associated to
abelian groups, as graph bundles. Moreover, we can find a family of connected
cubic (multi)graphs that contains the family of connected I-graphs as a
subfamily.

permits us to perform a theoretical analysis of the relation between angular

difference is that here we reduce the problem to discrete many-body case, where
all physical properties of the system are determined by the interaction

quadrupole here) expansion of Newtonian potential so that all hydrodynamic,

approximate $U(1)_R$ symmetry in such a way that one of the left chiral
sneutrinos can acquire a large vacuum expectation value ($vev$) and can play
the role of the down-type Higgs. This $R$-symmetry allows a subset of trilinear
$R$-parity violating interactions, which determine the collider phenomenology
of this model in a significant way. The gauginos are Dirac particles and
gluinos are relatively heavy in this class of models. The model contains a
right handed neutrino superfield, which gives a tree level mass to one of the
active neutrinos. An order one neutrino Yukawa coupling also helps enhance the
Higgs boson mass at the tree level and results in a very light bino-like
neutralino ($\widetilde \chi_2^0$) with mass around a few hundred MeV, which is
a carrier of missing (transverse) energy (\met). The model can accommodate two
rather light top squarks, compatible with the observed mass of the Higgs boson.
The lighter top squark (${\widetilde t}_1$) can decay into
$t\widetilde\chi_2^0$, and thus the signal would be similar to the signal of
top quark pair production at the LHC. In addition, fully visible decays such as
${\widetilde t}_2 \rightarrow b e^+$ can give rise to interesting final states.
Such signals at the LHC combined with other features like a heavy gluino could
provide a strong evidence for this kind of a model. Our analysis shows that
$m_{\widetilde t_1}\lsim 575~(750)$ GeV and $m_{\widetilde t_2}\lsim 1.2~(1.4)$
TeV can be probed with 5$\sigma$ statistical significance at the 13 TeV LHC

the presence of super-light carriers of \met, the so-called `stealth' top
squark scenario may naturally appear in our model.

Brownian motion, the representative model of diffusion, played a important role
in the advancement of scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, biology and
finance. However, in recent decades, non-diffusive transport processes with
non-Brownian statistics were observed experimentally in a multitude of
scientific fields. Examples include human travel, in-cell dynamics, the motion
of bright points on the solar surface, the transport of charge carriers in
amorphous semiconductors, the propagation of contaminants in groundwater, the
search patterns of foraging animals and the transport of energetic particles in
turbulent plasmas. These examples showed that the assumptions of the classical
diffusion paradigm, assuming an underlying uncorrelated (Markovian), Gaussian
stochastic process, need to be relaxed to describe transport processes
exhibiting a non-local character and exhibiting long-range correlations.
  This article does not aim at presenting a complete review of non-diffusive
transport, but rather an introduction for readers not familiar with the topic.

deterministic receiver can only increase capacity if also the stochastic
receiver has P-MSI. The latter holds only for the setting without a common
message: if the encoder also conveys a common message, then P-MSI to the

  These capacity results are used to show that feedback from the stochastic
receiver can increase the capacity of the SD-BC without P-MSI and the sum-rate
capacity of the SD-BC with P-MSI at the deterministic receiver. The link
between P-MSI and feedback is a feedback code, which---roughly speaking---turns
feedback into P-MSI at the stochastic receiver and hence helps the stochastic
receiver mitigate experienced interference. For the case where the stochastic
receiver has full MSI (F-MSI) and can thus fully mitigate experienced
interference also in the absence of feedback, it is shown that feedback cannot

indicate that both the magnitude and the direction of the gate field have a
significant effect on the conductance and the spin polarization. The spin
filtration efficiency can be improved by properly tuning the gate voltage,
especially in the case of strong dephasing regime. And the spin polarization
increases monotonically with the molecular length without the gate voltage,
which is consistent with the recent experiment, and presents oscillating
behavior in the presence of the gate voltage. In addition, the spin selectivity
is robust against the dephasing, the on-site energy disorder, and the space
angle disorder under the gate voltage. Our results could motivate further

be extended into a deep architecture, inspired by recent successes of deep

joint feature boosting and dictionary learning. In each layer, we construct a
dictionary of filters by combining the filters from the lower layer, and
iteratively optimize the image representation with a joint
discriminative-generative formulation, i.e. minimization of empirical
classification error plus regularization of analysis image generation over
training images. For optimization, we perform two iterating steps: i) to
minimize the classification error, select the most discriminative features
using the gentle adaboost algorithm; ii) according to the feature selection,
update the filters to minimize the regularization on analysis image
representation using the gradient descent method. Once the optimization is
converged, we learn the higher layer representation in the same way. Our model
delivers several distinct advantages. First, our layer-wise optimization
provides the potential to build very deep architectures. Second, the generated
image representation is compact and meaningful. In several visual recognition
tasks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Wang-Landau sampling of continuous systems reported by several authors.
Trapping is caused by the random walker coming close to a local energy
extremum, although the mechanism is different from that of critical slowing
down encountered in conventional molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations.
When trapped, the random walker misses entire or even several stages of
Wang-Landau modification factor reduction, leading to inadequate sampling of
configuration space and a rough density-of-states even though the modification
factor has been reduced to very small values. Trapping is dependent on specific
systems, the choice of energy bins, and Monte Carlo step size, making it highly
unpredictable. A general, simple, and effective solution is proposed where the
configurations of multiple parallel Wang-Landau trajectories are inter-swapped
to prevent trapping. We also explain why swapping frees the random walker from
such traps. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated.

network, which consists of one hybrid access point (AP), one source and one
relay to assist information transmission. Unlike conventional cooperative
networks, the source and relay are assumed to have no embedded energy supplies
in the considered system. Hence, they need to first harvest energy from the
radio-frequency (RF) signals radiated by the AP in the downlink (DL) before
information transmission in the uplink (UL). Inspired by the recently proposed
harvest-then-transmit (HTT) and harvest-then-cooperate (HTC) protocols, we
develop a new adaptive transmission (AT) protocol. In the proposed protocol, at
the beginning of each transmission block, the AP charges the source. AP and
source then perform channel estimation to acquire the channel state information
(CSI) between them. Based on the CSI estimate, the AP adaptively chooses the
source to perform UL information transmission either directly or cooperatively
with the relay. We derive an approximate closed-form expression for the average
throughput of the proposed AT protocol over Nakagami-m fading channels. The
analysis is then verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the
proposed AT protocol considerably outperforms both the HTT and HTC protocols.

ubiquitous across modern communications. They allow for the exchange of
messages from one sender to multiple recipients, with the guarantees that
messages cannot be forged or tampered with and that messages also can be
forwarded from one recipient to another without compromising their validity.
Signatures are different from, but no less important than encryption, which
ensures the privacy of a message. Commonly used signature protocols -
signatures based on the Rivest-Adleman-Shamir (RSA) algorithm, the digital
signature algorithm (DSA), and the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm
(ECDSA) - are only computationally secure, similar to public key encryption
methods. In fact, since these rely on the difficulty of finding discrete
logarithms or factoring large primes, it is known that they will become
completely insecure with the emergence of quantum computers. We may therefore
see a shift towards signature protocols that will remain secure even in a
post-quantum world. Ideally, such schemes would provide unconditional or
information-theoretic security. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible
and comprehensive review of existing unconditionally secure signature schemes
for signing classical messages, with a focus on unconditionally secure quantum
signature schemes.

existence of metrics of positive scalar curvature. We define a Cauchy Domain of
Outer Communications (CDOC) to be an asymptotically flat initial set $(M, g,
K)$ such that the boundary $\partial M$ of $M$ is a collection of Marginally
Outer (or Inner) Trapped Surfaces (MOTSs and/or MITSs) and such that
$M\setminus \partial M$ contains no MOTSs or MITSs. This definition is meant to
capture, on the level of the initial data sets, the well known notion of the
domain of outer communications (DOC) as the region of spacetime outside of all
the black holes (and white holes). Our main theorem establishes that in
dimensions $3\leq n \leq 7$, a CDOC which satisfies the dominant energy
condition and has a strictly stable boundary has a positive scalar curvature
metric which smoothly compactifies the asymptotically flat end and is a
Riemannian product metric near the boundary where the cross sectional metric is
conformal to a small perturbation of the initial metric on the boundary
$\partial M$ induced by $g$. This result may be viewed as a generalization of
Galloway and Schoen's higher dimensional black hole topology theorem
\cite{GS06} to the exterior of the horizon. We also show how this result leads
to a number of topological restrictions on the CDOC, which allows one to also
view this as an extension of the initial data topological censorship theorem,
established in \cite{EGP13} in dimension $n=3$, to higher dimensions.

  analysis",,,,"quant-ph cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the quantum state tomography problem, one wishes to estimate an unknown
$d$-dimensional mixed quantum state $\rho$, given few copies. We show that
$O(d/\epsilon)$ copies suffice to obtain an estimate $\hat{\rho}$ that
satisfies $\|\hat{\rho} - \rho\|_F^2 \leq \epsilon$ (with high probability). An
immediate consequence is that $O(\mathrm{rank}(\rho) \cdot d/\epsilon^2) \leq
O(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies suffice to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate in
the standard trace distance. This improves on the best known prior result of
$O(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ copies for full tomography, and even on the best known
prior result of $O(d^2\log(d/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2)$ copies for spectrum
estimation. Our result is the first to show that nontrivial tomography can be
obtained using a number of copies that is just linear in the dimension.
  Next, we generalize these results to show that one can perform efficient
principal component analysis on $\rho$. Our main result is that $O(k
d/\epsilon^2)$ copies suffice to output a rank-$k$ approximation $\hat{\rho}$
whose trace distance error is at most $\epsilon$ more than that of the best
rank-$k$ approximator to $\rho$. This subsumes our above trace distance
tomography result and generalizes it to the case when $\rho$ is not guaranteed
to be of low rank. A key part of the proof is the analogous generalization of
our spectrum-learning results: we show that the largest $k$ eigenvalues of
$\rho$ can be estimated to trace-distance error $\epsilon$ using
$O(k^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies. In turn, this result relies on a new coupling
theorem concerning the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm that should be of

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed to compare
the nanostructures produced by these two techniques in what we believe is the
first direct comparison of fabrication techniques for nominally identical
nanowires. Both EBL and FIB methods produced high quality structures with edge
roughness being of the order of the mean grain size 5 -10 nm observed in the
continuous films. However, significant grain growth was observed along the
edges of the FIB patterned nanowires. Lorentz TEM \emph{in situ} imaging was
carried out to compare the magnetic behavior of the domain walls in the
patterned nanowires with anti-notches present to pin domain walls. The overall
process of domain wall pinning and depinning at the anti-notches showed
consistent behaviour between nanowires fabricated by the two methods with the
FIB structures having slightly lower characteristic fields compared to the EBL
wires. However, a significant difference was observed in the formation of a
vortex structure inside the anti-notches of the EBL nanowires after depinning
of the domain walls. No vortex structure was seen inside the anti-notches of
the FIB patterned nanowires. Results from micromagnetic simulations suggest
that the vortex structure inside the anti-notch can be suppressed if the
saturation magnetization (M$_{s}$) is reduced along the nanowires edges. Whilst
the two fabrication methods show that well defined structures can be produced
for the dimensions considered here, the differences in the magnetic behavior
for nominally identical structures may be an issue if such structures are to be
used as conduits for domain walls in potential memory and logic applications.

using reflectance or digital levels of photographic or satellite data. One of
the most common methodologies based on CORINE land cover (Coordination of
Information on the Environment) data, which classifies natural cover according
to a small number of categories. This method produces generalizations about the
inventoried areas, resulting in the loss of important floristic and structural
information about vegetation types present (such as palm groves, tall dense
mangroves, and dense forests). This classification forfeits relevant
information on sites with high heterogeneity and diversity. Especially in the
tropics, simplification of coverage types reaches its maximum level with the
use of deforestation analysis, particularly when it is reduced to the two
classes of forests and nonforests. As this paper demonstrates, these results
have considerable consequences for political efforts to conserve the
biodiversity of megadiverse countries. We designed a new methodological
approach that incorporates biological distinctiveness combined with
phytosociological classification of vegetation and its relation to physical
features. This approach is based on parameters obtained through canonical
correspondence analysis on a fuzzy logic model, which are used to construct
multiple coverage maps. This tool is useful for monitoring and analyzing
vegetation dynamics, since it maintains the typological integrity of a
cartographic series. The methodology creates cartographic series congruent in
time and scale, can be applied to multiple and varied satellite inputs, and
always evaluates the same model parameters. We tested this new method in the
southwestern Colombian Caribbean region and compared our results with those
from what we believe are outdated tools used in other analyses of deforestation

mid-rapidity from central events produced in d+Au, Cu+Cu, Au+Au collisions at
RHIC and p+Pb, Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. Even though there are strong medium
effects in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions, the results show that the Tsallis
distribution can be used to fit most of particle spectra in the collisions
studied except in Au+Au collisions where some deviations are seen for proton
and $\Lambda$ at low $p_T$. In addition, as the Tsallis distribution can only
fit part of the particle spectra produced in Pb+Pb collisions where $p_T$ is up
to 20 GeV/c, a new formula with one more fitting degree of freedom is proposed
in order to reproduce the entire $p_T$ region.

flat and circular surfaces, but the necessary conditions for the block to leave
(or not) the surface deserve a detailed treatment.
  In this article, using basic differential geometry, we generalize this
problem to an arbitrary surface, including the effects of friction, providing a
general expression to determine under which conditions the particle leaves the
surface. An explicit integral form for the velocity is given, which is
analytically integrable for some cases, and we find general criteria to
determine the critical velocity at which the particle immediately leaves the
surface. Five curves, a circle, ellipse, parabola, catenary and cycloid, are
analyzed in detail. Several interesting features appear, for instance, in the
absense of friction, a particle moving on a catenary leaves the surface just
before touching the floor, and in the case of the parabola, the particle never
leaves the surface, regardless of the friction. A phase diagram that separates
the conditions that lead to a particle stopping in the surface to those that
lead to a particle departuring from the surface is also discussed.

  displays","22 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A simulation method based on the liquid crystal response and the human visual
system is suitable to characterize motion blur for LCDs but not other display
types. We propose a more straightforward and widely applicable method to
quantify motion blur based on the width of the moving object. We thus compare
various types of displays objectively. A perceptual experiment was conducted to
validate the proposed method. We test varying motion velocities for nine
commercial displays. We compare the three motion blur evaluation methods
(simulation, human perception, and our method) using z-scores. Our comparisons
indicate that our method accurately characterizes motion blur for various
display types.
