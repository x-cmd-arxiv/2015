strongly magnetized white dwarfs, since such objects may prove to be a source
of over-luminous type-Ia supernovae. In an earlier paper, we have presented the
mass-radius relation of white dwarfs with a strong poloidal magnetic field in
Newtonian gravity. The inclusion of effects such as general relativistic
gravity and many-body corrections to the equation of state can alter the
mass-radius relation and the maximum mass. In this work we estimate the extent
to which these effects may modify the earlier results. We find that the general
relativistic effects tend to reduce the maximum mass by about 2% and many-body
corrections by another additional $\sim$2%, for an assumed carbon composition.
We also explore field geometries that are purely toroidal or a mixture of
poloidal and toroidal and find that the limiting mass of such equilibrium
configurations can be substantially higher than in the case of a purely
poloidal field.

  of the Squared Distance Function",,,,,"math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new stable mathematical model for locating and measuring the
medial axis of geometric objects, called the quadratic multiscale medial axis
map of scale $\lambda$, and prove a sharp regularity result for the
squared-distance function to any closed non-empty subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Our results exploit properties of the function $C^l_{\lambda}(dist^2(\cdot;\,
K))$ obtained by applying the quadratic lower compensated convex transform of
parameter $\lambda$ to $dist^2(\cdot;\, K)$, the Euclidean squared-distance
function to $K$. Using an estimate for the tight approximation of
$dist^2(\cdot;\, K)$ by $C^l_{\lambda}(dist^2(\cdot;\, K))$, we prove
$C^{1,1}$-regularity of $dist^2(\cdot;\, K)$ outside a neighbourhood of the
closure of the medial axis $M_K$ of $K$, and give an asymptotic formula for
$C^l_{\lambda}(dist^2(\cdot;\, K))$ in terms of the scaled squared distance to
$K$ and to the convex hull of the set of points that realize the minimum
distance to $K$. The multiscale medial axis map, $M_{\lambda}(\cdot;\, K)$, is
a family of non-negative functions whose limit as $\lambda \to \infty$ exists
and is called the multiscale medial axis landscape map, $M_{\infty}(\cdot;\,
K)$. We show $M_{\infty}(\cdot;\, K)$ is strictly positive on the medial axis
$M_K$ and zero elsewhere. We give conditions to ensure $M_{\lambda}(\cdot;\,
K)$ keeps a constant height along parts of $M_K$ generated by two-point subsets
with the height dependent on the distance between the generating points, so
giving a hierarchy between different parts of $M_K$ that enables subsets of
$M_K$ to be selected by thresholding. Given a compact subset $K$ of
$\mathbb{R}^n$, while it is well known that $M_K$ is not Hausdorff stable, we
prove $M_{\lambda}(\cdot;\, K)$ is stable under Hausdorff distance, and deduce
implications for localization of the stable parts of $M_K$. Examples are
included.

and process data for a variety of applications (e.g., traffic monitoring,
spectrum sensing). In this study, a socially-aware crowdsensing system is
advocated, in which a cloud-based platform incentivizes mobile users to
participate in sensing tasks} by leveraging social trust among users, upon
receiving sensing requests. For this system, social trust assisted reciprocity
(STAR) - a synergistic marriage of social trust and reciprocity, is exploited
to design an incentive mechanism that stimulates users' participation.
  Given the social trust structure among users, the efficacy of STAR for
satisfying users' sensing requests is thoroughly investigated. Specifically, it
is first shown that all requests can be satisfied if and only if sufficient
social credit can be ""transferred"" from users who request more sensing service
than they can provide to users who can provide more than they request. Then
utility maximization for sensing services under STAR is investigated, and it is
shown that it boils down to maximizing the utility of a circulation flow in the
combined social graph and request graph. Accordingly, an algorithm that
iteratively cancels a cycle of positive weight in the residual graph is
developed, which computes the optimal solution efficiently, for both cases of
divisible and indivisible sensing service. Extensive simulation results
corroborate that STAR can significantly outperform the mechanisms using social
trust only or reciprocity only.

investigated analytically by decomposition of the velocity and magnetic fields
in Fourier space into helical modes. Steady solutions of the dynamical system
which governs the evolution of the helical modes are determined, and a
stability analysis of these solutions is carried out. The interpretation of the
analysis is that unstable solutions lead to energy transfer between the
interacting modes while stable solutions do not. From this, a dependence of
possible interscale energy and helicity transfers on the helicities of the
interacting modes is derived. As expected from the inverse cascade of magnetic
helicity in 3D MHD turbulence, mode interactions with like helicities lead to
transfer of energy and magnetic helicity to smaller wavenumbers. However, some
interactions of modes with unlike helicities also contribute to an inverse
energy transfer. As such, an inverse energy cascade for nonhelical magnetic
fields is shown to be possible. Furthermore, it is found that high values of
the cross-helicity may have an asymmetric effect on forward and reverse
transfer of energy, where forward transfer is more quenched in regions of high
cross-helicity than reverse transfer. This conforms with recent observations of
solar wind turbulence. For specific helical interactions the relation to dynamo
action is established.

2.:619--623) and in (S. Shelah, Fund. Math. 159 (1999), no. 1:1--50). We prove
that the above statement holds assuming $\Diamond_\kappa$ and the set
theoretical hypothesis $I^-(\kappa)$, which is the modification of the
hypothesis $I(\kappa)$ suitable for limit cardinals. When $\kappa$ is
inaccessible, or when $R$ is a closed binary relation, the assumption
$\Diamond_\kappa$ is not needed.
  We obtain as a corollary the uncountable version of a result by G. S\'agi and
the first author (Log. J. IGPL 20 (2012), no. 6:1064--1082) about the
$\kappa$-sized models of a $\Sigma^1_1(L_{\kappa^+\kappa})$-sentence when
considered up to isomorphism, or elementary embeddability, by elements of a
$K_\kappa$ subset of ${}^\kappa\kappa$. The role of elementary embeddings can
be replaced by a more general notion that also includes embeddings, as well as
the maps preserving $L_{\lambda\mu}$ for $\omega\leq\mu\leq\lambda\leq\kappa$
and the finite variable fragments of these logics.

in leveraging the dense and increasingly heterogeneous deployment of
multi-radio wireless networks. Traffic aggregation across different access
points (APs)/radio access technologies (RATs) has become an important feature
of recently introduced cellular standards on LTE dual connectivity and LTE-WLAN
aggregation (LWA). Low complexity traffic splitting solutions for scenarios
where the APs are not necessarily collocated are of great interest for
operators. In this paper, we consider a scenario, where traffic for each user
may be split across macrocell and an LTE or WiFi small cells connected by
non-ideal backhaul links, and develop a closed form solution for optimal
aggregation accounting for the backhaul delay. The optimal solution lends
itself to a ""water-filling"" based interpretation, where the fraction of user's
traffic sent over macrocell is proportional to ratio of user's peak capacity on
that macrocell and its throughput on the small cell. Using comprehensive system
level simulations, the developed optimal solution is shown to provide
substantial edge and median throughput gain over algorithms representative of
current 3GPP-WLAN interworking solutions. The achievable performance benefits
hold promise for operators expecting to introduce aggregation solutions with
their existing WLAN deployments.

terms of closeness to the instantaneous steady state. While the general result
is conceptually similar to the closed system case, there are important
differences. Namely, a system initialized in the zero-eigenvalue eigenspace of
$\mathcal{L}(t)$ will remain in this eigenspace with a deviation that is
inversely proportional to the total evolution time $T$. In the case of a finite
number of level crossings the scaling becomes $T^{-\eta}$ with an exponent
$\eta$ that we relate to the rate of the gap closing. For master equations that
describe relaxation to thermal equilibrium, we show that the evolution time $T$

trend, while a minor fraction of quasars show the opposite behaviour. This is
similar to the results obtained from other two independent algorithms namely
the weighted linear least squares fit (FITEXY) and the bivariate correlated
errors and intrinsic scatter regression (BCES). However, the ordinary least
squares (OLS) fit normally used in the colour variability studies of quasars,
indicates that all the quasars studied here show a bluer when brighter trend.
It is therefore very clear that OLS algorithm cannot be used for the study of
colour variability in quasars.

to hydration favors the helix state in the coil-to-helix transition and the
paired helix bundle in the assembly of two helices. The energetic contributions
of attractive protein-solvent interactions are separated into a short-range
part arising from interactions with solvent in the first hydration shell and
the remaining long-range part. In the helix-coil transition, short-range
attractive protein-solvent interactions outweigh hydrophobic hydration and
favor the unfolded coil states. Analysis of enthalpic effects shows that it is
the favorable hydration of the peptide backbone that favors the unfolded state.
Protein intramolecular interactions favor the helix state and are decisive in
folding. In the pairing of two helices, the cavity contribution outweighs
short-range attractive protein-water interactions. However, long-range,
protein-solvent attractive interactions can either enhance or reverse this
trend depending on the mutual orientation of the helices. In helix-helix
assembly, change in enthalpy arising from change in attractive protein-solvent
interactions favors disassembly. In helix pairing as well, favorable protein
intramolecular interactions are found to be as important as hydration effects.

single-particle (s/p) energies of nucleons in NM are determined according to
the Hugenholtz-van Hove theorem, which gives rise naturally to a rearrangement
term (RT) of the s/p potential at the Fermi momentum. Using the RT obtained
exactly at the different NM densities and neutron-proton asymmetries, a
consistent method is suggested to take into account effectively the momentum
dependence of the RT of the s/p potential within the standard HF scheme. To
obtain a realistic momentum dependence of the nucleon optical potential (OP),
the high-momentum part of the s/p potential was accurately readjusted to
reproduce the observed energy dependence of the nucleon OP over a wide range of
energies. The impact of the RT and momentum dependence of the s/p potential on
the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and nucleon effective
mass has been studied in details. The high-momentum tail of the s/p potential
was found to have a sizable effect on the slope of the symmetry energy and the
neutron-proton effective mass splitting at supranuclear densities of the NM.
Based on a local density approximation, the folding model of the nucleon OP of
finite nuclei has been extended to take into account consistently the RT and
momentum dependence of the nucleon OP in the same mean-field manner, and
successfully applied to study the elastic neutron scattering on the lead target
at the energies around the Fermi energy.

algorithm of fast and accurate object detection. By sampling particle windows
from a proposal distribution (PD), MPW avoids exhaustively scanning the image.
Despite its success, it is unknown how to determine the number of stages and
the number of particle windows in each stage. Moreover, it has to generate too
many particle windows in the initialization step and it redraws unnecessary too
many particle windows around object-like regions. In this paper, we attempt to
solve the problems of MPW. An important fact we used is that there is large
probability for a randomly generated particle window not to contain the object
because the object is a sparse event relevant to the huge number of candidate
windows. Therefore, we design the proposal distribution so as to efficiently
reject the huge number of non-object windows. Specifically, we propose the
concepts of rejection, acceptance, and ambiguity windows and regions. This
contrasts to MPW which utilizes only on region of support. The PD of MPW is

model of ionic liquids, we have investigated the impact that the shape and the
intramolecular charge distribution of the ions have on the electrotuneable
friction with ionic-liquid nanoscale films. We show that the electric-field
induces significant structural changes in the film, leading to dramatic
modifications of the friction force. Comparison of the present work with
previous studies using different models of ionic liquids indicate that the
phenomenology presented here applies to a wide range of ionic liquids. In
particular, the electric-field-induced shift of the slippage plane from the
solid-liquid interface to the interior of the film and the non-monotonic
variation of the friction force are common features of ionic lubricants under
strong confinement. We also demonstrate that the molecular structure of the
ions plays an important role in determining the electrostriction and
electroswelling of the confined film, hence showing the importance of
ion-specific effects in electrotuneable friction.

Angular (Projected) separations for the binaries are greater than 2""($\sim$280
AU), which allowed us to perform spatially resolved photometry of individual
primary and secondary sources. The measured occurrence of infrared excess
suggests that binarity plays a role in the evolution of circumstellar disks,
even at such wide binary separations. Most of the binaries have excess emission
from both the circumprimary and circumsecondary disks, or show photospheric
levels for both components at all four wavelengths of IRAC. On the other hand,
four systems ($17^{+11}_{-8}$%, designated by ""mixed"" systems) exhibit excess
emission from a single binary component. This ratio is significantly smaller
than that predicted by the random pairing of single stars, suggesting that
circumprimary and circumsecondary disks are synchronously dispersed. In
addition, the excess frequencies (EFs) of primary and secondary sources with a
projected distance of $a_{\rm p}$$\simeq$280--450 AU are $100^{+0}_{-17}$% and
$91^{+8}_{-18}$%, respectively, and significantly higher than that of single
stars ($70 \pm 5$%). We made a simple model describing the EF distribution as a
function of the disk outer radius, $R_{\rm out}$. Comparisons with observations
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test show that the observational data are
consistent with the model when the $\rm{EF} \simeq 1$ region is found at
$R_{\rm out}$$\sim$30--100 AU. This disk radius is smaller than that typically
estimated for single stars. The high EF of circumstellar disks with these radii
may indicate a prolonged lifetime of dust in binary systems possibly because
smaller disks counteract mass loss by photoevaporation.

quasi-two-dimensional projections of the velocity field on three coordinate

divergence-free Galerkin bases, which resulted in the whole procedure being
complicated and CPU-time consuming. Here we propose an alternative way based on
the Chorin projection combined with a SIMPLE-like iteration. The approach
proposed is much easier in realization, allows for faster computations, and can
be generalized for arbitrary curvilinear orthogonal coordinates. To illustrate
the visualization method, examples of flow visualization in cylindrical and
spherical coordinates, as well as post-processing of experimental 3D-PTV data

most promising two dimensional group-V elemental monolayers with direct band
gap, high carrier mobility, and anisotropic electronic properties. In this
letter, the buckling and its effect on the electronic properties in phosphorene
are investigated by using molecular dynamics simulations and complemented by
density functional theory calculations. We find that phosphorene shows superior
out-of-plane structural flexibility along the armchair direction, which allows
the formation of buckling with large curvatures, while the buckling along the
zigzag direction will break its structure integrity at large curvatures. The
semiconducting and direct band gap nature are retained with buckling along the
armchair direction; the band gap decreases and transforms to an indirect band
gap with buckling along the zigzag direction. The structural flexibility and
electronic robustness along the armchair direction facilitate the fabrication
of devices with complex shapes, such as folded phosphorene and phosphorene
nano-scrolls, thereby offering new possibilities for the application of
phosphorene in flexible electronics and optoelectronics.

dielectric function of a plasma consisting of quantum particles interacting via
Coulomb forces, namely the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and the Standard
(Simple) Plasmon Pole Approximation (SPPA). It is shown that these models
describe different non-overlapping plasma regimes. The RPA describes a weakly
coupled plasma whose dynamics are an admixture of independent particle modes at
short wavelengths and collective plasma modes at long wavelengths. The SPPA
describes a system dominated by collective resonances at all wavelengths. A new
model of a multicomponent plasma, the Generalized Plasmon Pole Approximation
(GPPA), is formulated and shown to provide a description of a range of plasma
regimes encompassing both those described by the RPA and the SPPA. Therefore,
as well as providing a good representation of the RPA, in both quantum and
classical, regimes, this new model also provides a promising basis for
modelling non-ideal quantum plasmas, which are plasmas in regimes of
significantly stronger coupling than are addressed by the RPA.

diagrams of sleptons. We find a parameter set of the model, where in addition
to the neutrino oscillation data, experimental constraints from the lepton
flavor violating decays of charged leptons and current LHC data are also

mu nu with 50% of a branching ratio for each. In such a case, the relation

factors contribute to make an information becoming viral: how influential the
person who spreads is inside its network and the content of the message. The
former should have a more important role, since people will not just blindly
share any content, or will they? In this work it is found that the degree of a
node alone is capable of accurately predicting how many followers of the seed
user will spread the information through a simple linear regression. The
analysis was performed with five different messages from Twitter network that
was shared with different degrees along the users. The results show evidences

often provides a unique opportunity to address questions of fundamental and
practical importance. The coexistence of ferroelectric and topological orders
is one such example. Ferroelectrics, which have a spontaneous macroscopic
polarization switchable by an applied electric field, usually are
semiconductors with a well-developed wide band gap with a few exceptions. On
the other hand, time-reversal symmetric $Z_2$ topological insulators (TI),
characterized by robust metallic surface states protected by the topology of
the bulk, usually are narrow-gap semiconductors ($< 0.7$ eV) which allow band
inversion induced by the spin-orbit interaction. To date, a ferroelectric
topological insulator (FETI) has remained elusive, owing to the seemingly
contradictory characters of the ferroelectric and topological orders. Here, we
report that the FETI can be realized in halide perovskite CsPbI$_3$ under
strain. Our first-principles study reveals that a non-centrosymmetric
ferroelectric structure of CsPbI$_3$ is energetically favored under a wide
range of pressures, while maintaining its topological order. The proposed FETI
is characterized by switchable polar surfaces with spin-momentum locked Dirac
cones, which allows for electric-field control of topological surface states
(TSSs) and the surface spin current. Our demonstration of a FETI in a feasible
material opens doors for future studies combining ferroelectric and topological
orders, and offers a new paradigm for diverse applications in electronics,
spintronics, and quantum information.

fairly strong gateway. In practice though, passwords are plagued with problems.
They are (1) easily shared, (2) trivial to observe and (3) maddeningly elusive
when forgotten. While alternatives to passwords have been proposed, none, as
yet, have been adopted widely. There seems to be a reluctance to switch from
tried and tested passwords to novel alternatives, even if the most glaring
flaws of passwords can be mitigated. One argument is that there is not enough
investigation into the feasibility of many password alternatives. Graphical
authentication mechanisms are a case in point. Therefore, in this paper, we
detail the design of two prototype applications that utilise graphical
authentication mechanisms. However, when forced to consider the design of such
prototypes, we find that pertinent password problems eg. observation of entry,
are just that: password problems. We conclude that effective, alternative
authentication mechanisms should target authentication scenarios rather than
the well-known problems of passwords. This is the only route to wide-spread
adoption of alternatives.

  corroboration of the inverse square law for 433.5 MHz radiation","Compliance with SI terminology. Language improvements. Results
  unchanged",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel, low-budget, open-air, slant-geometry antenna test range for UHF
radiation is presented. It was designed primarily to facilitate variation of
the distance between emitter and receiver antennas, but has also the potential
for adaptation to simultaneous variation of distance and receiver antenna
orientation. In support of the validity of the range the inverse square law for
433.5 MHz radiation between two naked half-wave dipole antennas was tested with
high spatial resolution from close to the far field limit outward to 46
wavelengths. The ratio of sine-amplitude input voltages to the receiver antenna
at two distances between the antennas diminished in proportion to the
corresponding inverse distance ratio to the power 0.9970 +/- 0.0051 (R^2 =
0.992). This value is indistinguishable from the theoretical value of 1 and
confirms the proportionality of the electric field strength to the inverse
distance from the radiation source. Given the known proportionality of
irradiance to the square of the electric field strength, the result
corroborates the inverse square law for irradiance at the lowest frequency for
which thus far data have been published.

revolutionised a wide range of fundamental and applied research areas by
offering high peak powers, high repetition rates, femtosecond range pulse
widths and a narrow linewidth. However, further progress in linewidth narrowing
seems to be limited by the complexity of the carrier-envelope phase control.
Here for the first time we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically a new
mechanism of resonance vector self-mode locking where tuning in-cavity
birefringence leads to excitation of the longitudinal modes sidebands
accompanied by the resonance phase locking of sidebands with the adjacent
longitudinal modes. An additional resonance with acoustic phonons provides the
repetition rate tunability and linewidth narrowing down to Hz range that
drastically reduces the complexity of the carrier-envelope phase control and so
will open the way to advance lasers in the context of applications in
metrology, spectroscopy, microwave photonics, astronomy, and
telecommunications.

manifest themselves as holes in space. In general, these holes propagate at the
speed of light through an expanding universe with boundary denoted by U, which
is comprised of pulsating cells. These holes can form bound and semi-bound
states. The geometry of U is non-Euclidean on a small scale, but there are
indications that it can become Euclidean on a large scale. The motions of
elementary particles through U are governed by probability 4 and 7-vectors,
which are related to the momentum vectors in Minkowski space. The connection of
this theory to Newtonian gravity is discussed, and an expression for the
gravitational redshift of photons is derived which relates the redshift to the
probability that a photon absorbs a virtual graviton. The theory also provides
a possible explanation of dark matter and dark energy as gravitational
phenomena, which do not require the introduction of any new particles. A
quantum cosmology is presented in which all the physical forces first appear on
the ever expanding boundary of U, and then migrate into the interior. This
cosmology also permits us to interpret U as a cellular automaton.

and light is only integrated part of the time. By carefully selecting the

energy. In problems such as motion deblurring the available energy is what
caused the problem in the first place (as strong illumination allows short
exposure thus eliminates motion blur). It is still beneficial because the
benefit from the better conditioning outweighs the cost in energy.

better conditioning and better energy utilization than conventional flutter
