wind nebula DA 495 and its central object, J1952.2+2925, suggested to be the
pulsar, using archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data. J1952.2+2925 has a pure
thermal spectrum which is equally well fitted either by the blackbody model
with a temperature of $\approx 215$ eV and an emitting area radius of $\approx
0.6$ km or by magnetized neutron star atmosphere models with temperatures of
80-90 eV. In the latter case the thermal emission can come from the entire
neutron star surface which temperature is consistent with standard neutron star
cooling scenarios. We place also an upper limit on the J1952.2+2925 nonthermal
flux. The derived spectral parameters are generally compatible with published
ones based only on the Chandra data, but they are much more accurate due to the
inclusion of XMM-Newton data. No pulsations were found and we placed an upper
limit for the J1952.2+2925 pulsed emission fraction of 40 per cent. Utilizing
the interstellar absorption-distance relation, we estimated the distance to DA
495, which can be as large as 5 kpc if J1952.2+2925 emission is described by
the atmosphere models. We compiled possible multi-wavelength spectra of the
nebula including radio data; they depend on the spectral model of the central
object. Comparing the results with other pulsar plus wind nebula systems we set
reasonable constraints on the J1952.2+2925 spin-down luminosity and age. We
suggest that the Fermi source 3FGL J1951.6+2926 is the likely $\gamma$-ray
counterpart of J1952.2+2925.

$E_{tot} = 10^{34}\;\mbox{erg}$ of a flare that can occur on the young Sun at
its age of 1 Gyr when the cycle was formed. We believe that the main source of
the flare optical continuum is a low-temperature condensation forming in the
course of the response of the chromosphere to an impulsive heating. For a
superflare on the young Sun, we adopt the accelerated electron flux, $F_e
(E>\mbox{20 keV}) = 3 \times 10^{11} \: \mbox{erg} \; \mbox{cm}^{-2} \;
\mbox{s}^{-1}$, that is limited by the return current, and obtain the area of
the optical continuum source on a G star, $S \approx 10^{19} \:\mbox{cm}^2$.
This value is close to the area of the $H_\alpha$-ribbons in the largest solar
flares, while the area of bright patches of a white-light flare on the
contemporary Sun is smaller by about two orders of magnitude. At the same
electron flux and the hard electron spectrum, the stellar flare of the similar
energy should be accompanied by the microwave source of about 2 mJy at
frequencies 10--100 GHz at distance 100 pc. We discuss the possible detection
of the flare-produced lithium in the course of spallation reactions. The
detection of the flare microwave source and the emission in the Li resonant
line could demonstrate how effective can be particle acceleration on stars in

determinant as a characteristic function of the Jacobi ensemble, an asymptotic

using moment-matching techniques to provide a tighter approximation in

scattering/phase function (SPF) of the material in the disk. However,
characterizing the SPFs of these extrasolar debris disks is challenging because
only a limited range of scattering angles are visible to Earth-based observers.
By contrast, Saturn's tenuous rings can be observed over a much broader range
of geometries, so their SPFs can be much better constrained. Since these rings
are composed of small particles released from the surfaces of larger bodies,
they are reasonable analogs to debris disks and so their SPFs can provide
insights into the plausible scattering properties of debris disks. This work
examines two of Saturn's dusty rings: the G ring (at 167,500 km from Saturn's
center) and the D68 ringlet (at 67,600 km). Using data from the cameras onboard
the Cassini spacecraft, we are able to estimate the rings' brightnesses at
scattering angles ranging from 170 to 0.5 degrees. We find that both of the
rings exhibit extremely strong forward-scattering peaks, but for scattering
angles above 60 degrees their brightnesses are nearly constant. These SPFs can
be well approximated by a linear combination of three Henyey-Greenstein
functions, and are roughly consistent with the SPFs of irregular particles from
laboratory measurements. Comparing these data to Fraunhofer and Mie models
highlights several challenges involved in extracting information about particle
compositions and size distributions from SPFs alone. The SPFs of these rings
also indicate that the degree of forward scattering in debris disks may be
greatly underestimated.

Hydrogen (D/H) ratio as a function of their formation location from the Sun.
This is difficult to explain with a classical protoplanetary disk model that
has a decreasing temperature structure with radius from the Sun.
  We want to understand if a protoplanetary disc with a dead zone, a region of
zero or low turbulence, can explain the measured D/H values in comets and
chondrites.
  We use time snapshots of a vertically layered disk model with turbulent
surface layers and a dead zone at the midplane. The disc has a non-monotonic
temperature structure due to increased heating from self-gravity in the outer
parts of the dead zone. We couple this to a D/H ratio evolution model in order
to quantify the effect of such thermal profiles on D/H enrichment in the
nebula.
  We find that the local temperature peak in the disk can explain the diversity
in the D/H ratios of different chondritic families. This disk temperature
profile leads to a non-monotonic D/H enrichment evolution, allowing these
families to acquire their different D/H values while forming in close
proximity. The formation order we infer for these families is compatible with
that inferred from their water abundances. However, we find that even for very
young disks, the thermal profile reversal is too close to the Sun to be
relevant for comets.

labeling and body pose forecasting in videos. Our model handles mocap training
data across multiple subjects and activity domains, and synthesizes novel
motions while avoid drifting for long periods of time. For human pose labeling,
ERD outperforms a per frame body part detector by resolving left-right body
part confusions. For video pose forecasting, ERD predicts body joint
displacements across a temporal horizon of 400ms and outperforms a first order
motion model based on optical flow. ERDs extend previous Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) models in the literature to jointly learn representations and their
dynamics. Our experiments show such representation learning is crucial for both
labeling and prediction in space-time. We find this is a distinguishing feature
between the spatio-temporal visual domain in comparison to 1D text, speech or
handwriting, where straightforward hard coded representations have shown
excellent results when directly combined with recurrent units.

helix and whose cross section is a circle of small radius (compared to the
radius of curvature) where the vorticity is uniform and parallel to the
centerline. Ever since Joukowsky (1912) deduced that this vortex translates and
rotates steadily without change of form, numerous attempts have been made to
compute these self-induced velocities. Here we use Hardin's (1982) solution for
the velocity field to find new expressions for the vortex's linear and angular
velocities. Our results, verified by numerically computing the Helmholtz
integral and the Rosenhead-Moore approximation to the Biot-Savart law, are more
accurate than previous results over the whole range of values of the vortex
pitch and cross-section. We then use the new formulas to study the advection of
passive particles near the vortex; we find that the vortex's motion and
capacity to transport fluid depend on its pitch and cross section as follows: a
thin vortex of small pitch moves fast and carries a small amount of fluid; a
thick vortex of small pitch moves at intermediate velocities and is a moderate
carrier itself but it pushes fluid forward along the helix axis; and a vortex
of large pitch, whether thin or thick, moves slowly and carries a large amount
of fluid.

from incomplete and random block-wise image measurements and the performance of
the adaptive dictionary for sparse image recovery. This problem is related to
blind compressed sensing in which the sparsifying dictionary or basis is viewed
as an unknown variable and subject to estimation during sparse recovery.
However, unlike existing guarantees for a successful blind compressed sensing,
our results do not rely on additional structural constraints on the learned
dictionary or the measured signal. In particular, we rely on the spatial
diversity of compressive measurements to guarantee that the solution is unique
with a high probability. Moreover, our distinguishing goal is to measure and
reduce the estimation error with respect to the ideal dictionary that is based
on the complete image. Using recent results from random matrix theory, we show
that applying a slightly modified dictionary learning algorithm over
compressive measurements results in accurate estimation of the ideal dictionary
for large-scale images. Empirically, we experiment with both space-invariant
and space-varying sensing matrices and demonstrate the critical role of spatial
diversity in measurements. Simulation results confirm that the presented
algorithm outperforms the typical non-adaptive sparse recovery based on

with radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) capabilities should try and
harvest ambient RF energy. While the idea of RF-EH is appealing, it is not
always beneficial to attempt to harvest energy; in environments where the
ambient energy is low, nodes could consume more energy being awake with their
harvesting circuits turned on than what they can extract from the ambient radio
signals; it is then better to enter a sleep mode until the ambient RF energy
increases. Towards this end, we consider a scenario with intermittent energy
arrivals and a wireless node that wakes up for a period of time (herein called
the time-slot) and harvests energy. If enough energy is harvested during the
time-slot, then the harvesting is successful and excess energy is stored;
however, if there does not exist enough energy the harvesting is unsuccessful
and energy is lost.
  We assume that the ambient energy level is constant during the time-slot, and
changes at slot boundaries. The energy level dynamics are described by a
two-state Gilbert-Elliott Markov chain model, where the state of the Markov
chain can only be observed during the harvesting action, and not when in sleep
mode. Two scenarios are studied under this model. In the first scenario, we
assume that we have knowledge of the transition probabilities of the Markov
chain and formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP), where we find a threshold-based optimal policy. In the second
scenario, we assume that we don't have any knowledge about these parameters and
formulate the problem as a Bayesian adaptive POMDP; to reduce the complexity of
the computations we also propose a heuristic posterior sampling algorithm. The
performance of our approaches is demonstrated via numerical examples.

  The presented approach can compare microscopic behavior of molecular systems
to parametric and non-parametric coarse-grained one using the relative entropy
between distributions on the path space and setting up a corresponding path
space variational inference problem. The methods can become entirely
data-driven when the microscopic dynamics are replaced with corresponding

The state vector solves multiphase Stefan problem in a weak formulation, which

eigenvalue $J$. Eigenvalues $J$ and $E$ mutually imply each other. Jacobi's
theorem generates a microstate-dependent time parametrization
$t-\tau=\partial_E W$ even where energy, $E$, and action variable, $J$, are
quantized eigenvalues. Substantiating examples are examined in a
Hamilton-Jacobi representation including the linear harmonic oscillator
numerically and the square well in closed form. Two byproducts are developed.
First, the monotonic behavior of $W$ is shown to ease numerical and analytic
computations. Second, a Hamilton-Jacobi representation, quantum trajectories,
is shown to develop the standard energy quantization formulas of wave
mechanics..

(SDN) infrastructure in order to accommodate the ever-growing mobile traffic
and overcome the network management nightmares caused by unremitting
acceleration in technology innovations and evolution of the service
market.Enabled by virtualized network functionalities, evolving carrier
wireless networks tend to share radio access network (RAN) among multiple
(virtual) network operators so as to increase network capacity and reduce
expenses.However, existing RAN sharing models are operator-oriented, which
expose extensive resource details, e.g. infrastructure and spectrum,to
participating network operators for resource-sharing purposes. These
old-fashioned models violate the design principles of SDN abstraction and are
infeasible to manage the thriving traffic of on-demand customized services.
This paper presents SOARAN, a service-oriented framework for RAN sharing in
mobile networks evolving from LTE/LTE advanced to software-defined carrier
wireless networks(SD-CWNs), which decouples network operators from radio
resource by providing application-level differentiated services. SOARAN defines
a serial of abstract applications with distinct Quality of Experience (QoE)

resource allocation for each radio element with respect to runtime traffic
demands and channel conditions, and disseminate these allocation decisions as
service-oriented policies to respect element. The radio elements then
independently determine flow-level resource allocation within each application
to accomplish these policies. We formulate the application-level resource
allocation as an optimization problem and develop a fast algorithm to solve it

multimedia content retrieval and understanding. The idea that shape and texture
information (e.g. edge or orientation) are the key features for visual
representation is ingrained and dominated in current multimedia and computer
vision communities. A number of low-level features have been proposed by
computing local gradients (e.g. SIFT, LBP and HOG), and have achieved great
successes on numerous multimedia applications. In this paper, we present a
simple yet efficient local descriptor for image classification, referred as
Local Color Contrastive Descriptor (LCCD), by leveraging the neural mechanisms
of color contrast. The idea originates from the observation in neural science
that color and shape information are linked inextricably in visual cortical
processing. The color contrast yields key information for visual color
perception and provides strong linkage between color and shape. We propose a
novel contrastive mechanism to compute the color contrast in both spatial
location and multiple channels. The color contrast is computed by measuring
\emph{f}-divergence between the color distributions of two regions. Our
descriptor enriches local image representation with both color and contrast
information. We verified experimentally that it can compensate strongly for the
shape based descriptor (e.g. SIFT), while keeping computationally simple.
Extensive experimental results on image classification show that our descriptor
improves the performance of SIFT substantially by combinations, and achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmark datasets. It
improves recent Deep Learning model (DeCAF) [1] largely from the accuracy of
40.94% to 49.68% in the large scale SUN397 database. Codes for the LCCD will be

technique. The angle-resolved hyperfine parameters exhibit a tetragonal
anisotropy within the $ab$ plane and axial anisotropy with respect to the
$\langle 001\rangle$ ($\hat{c}$) axis. This strongly suggests that the Mu is
bound to O (forming an OH bond) at an off-center site within a channel along
the $\hat{c}$ axis, while the unpaired Mu electron is localized around the
neighboring Ti site. The hyperfine parameters are quantitatively explained by a
model that considers spin polarization of the unpaired electron at both the Ti
and O sites, providing evidence for the formation of Mu as a Ti-O-Mu complex
paramagnetic state. The disappearance of the Mu signal above $\sim$10 K
suggests that the energy necessary for the promotion of the unpaired electron
to the conduction band by thermal activation is of the order of $10^1$ meV.
These observations suggest that, while the electronic structure of Mu (and

Typical convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures rely on the use of
max-pooling operators in between layers, which leads to reduced resolution at
the top layers. Instead, in this work we consider a fully convolutional network
(FCN) architecture that uses causal filtering operations, and allows for the
rate of the output signal to be the same as that of the input signal. We
furthermore propose an undecimated version of the FCN, which we refer to as the
undecimated fully convolutional neural network (UFCNN), and is motivated by the
undecimated wavelet transform. Our experimental results verify that using the
undecimated version of the FCN is necessary in order to allow for effective
time-series modeling. The UFCNN has several advantages compared to other
time-series models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long
short-term memory (LSTM), since it does not suffer from either the vanishing or
exploding gradients problems, and is therefore easier to train. Convolution
operations can also be implemented more efficiently compared to the recursion
that is involved in RNN-based models. We evaluate the performance of our model
in a synthetic target tracking task using bearing only measurements generated
from a state-space model, a probabilistic modeling of polyphonic music
sequences problem, and a high frequency trading task using a time-series of
ask/bid quotes and their corresponding volumes. Our experimental results using
synthetic and real datasets verify the significant advantages of the UFCNN

detection for various planet-moon configurations that can be observable by
CHEOPS. We explore the most efficient way for such an observation which
minimizes the cost in observing time. Our study is based on PTV observations
(photocentric transit timing variation, Szab\'o et al. 2006) in simulated
CHEOPS data, but the recipe does not depend on the actual detection method, and
it can be substituted with e.g. the photodynamical method for later
applications. Using the current state-of-the-art level simulation of CHEOPS
data we analyzed transit observation sets for different star-planet-moon
configurations and performed a bootstrap analysis to determine their detection
statistics. We have found that the detection limit is around an Earth-sized
moon. In the case of favorable spatial configurations, systems with at least
such a large moon and with at least Neptune-sized planet, 80\% detection chance
requires at least 5-6 transit observations on average. There is also non-zero
chance in the case of smaller moons, but the detection statistics deteriorates
rapidly, while the necessary transit measurements increase fast. (abridged)

model which is a benchmark stochastic mortality model for forecasting
age-specific death rates. Existing relevant literature focuses mainly on
mortality forecasting or pricing of longevity derivatives, while the full
implications and methods of using the state-space representation of the
Lee-Carter model in pricing retirement income products is yet to be examined.
The main contribution of this article is twofold. First, we provide a rigorous
and detailed derivation of the posterior distributions of the parameters and
the latent process of the Lee-Carter model via Gibbs sampling. Our assumption
for priors is slightly more general than the current literature in this area.
Moreover, we suggest a new form of identification constraint not yet utilised
in the actuarial literature that proves to be a more convenient approach for
estimating the model under the state-space framework. Second, by exploiting the
posterior distribution of the latent process and parameters, we examine the
pricing range of annuities, taking into account the stochastic nature of the
dynamics of the mortality rates. In this way we aim to capture the impact of
longevity risk on the pricing of annuities. The outcome of our study
demonstrates that an annuity price can be more than 4% under-valued when
different assumptions are made on determining the survival curve constructed
from the distribution of the forecasted death rates. Given that a typical
annuity portfolio consists of a large number of policies with maturities which
span decades, we conclude that the impact of longevity risk on the accurate
pricing of annuities is a significant issue to be further researched. In
addition, we find that mis-pricing is increasingly more pronounced for older
ages as well as for annuity policies having a longer maturity.

for PIXE analysis. In this study, the beam line design used in PIXE analysis
was used to increase the production of isotopes instead of the typical
low-energy accelerator from a 13-MeV cyclotron. For PIXE analysis, the proton
beam should be focused at the target through the use of a nozzle after
degrading the proton beam energy from 13-MeV to 3-MeV using an energy degrader.
Previous studies have been conducted to determine the most appropriate material
and thickness of the energy degrader. Based on the energy distribution of the
degraded proton beam and the neutron occurrence rate at the degrader an
aluminum nozzle of X thickness was determined to be the most appropriate nozzle
construction. Neutrons are created by the collision of 3-MeV protons into the
nozzle after passage through energy degrader. In addition, a sufficient
intensity of proton beam is required for non-destructive analysis of PIXE.
Therefore, in order to optimize nozzle design, it is necessary to consider the
number of neutrons which arise from the collision of protons inside the nozzle,
as well as the track direction of the generated secondary neutrons, with the
primary aim of ensuring a sufficient number of protons passing through the
nozzle as a direct beam. A number of laboratories are currently conducting
research related to the design of nozzles used in accelerator fields, mostly
relating to medical fields. In this paper, a comparative analysis was carried
out for two typical nozzle shapes in order to minimize losses of protons and
generation of secondary neutrons. The neutron occurrence rate and the number of
protons after passing through the nozzle were analyzed using a Particle and
Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS) program, in order to identify the
nozzle which generated the strongest proton beam.

Unambiguous results, concerning fundamental conditions of the acid growth

abraded coleoptiles, because of the lowering of the cuticule potential barrier,
auxin-induced cell wall pH decreases simultaneously with the change in growth
rate; no advancement or retardation of pH (proton efflux rate) or growth rate

loosening and growth (3) Although the underlying molecular mechanisms vastly

growth similar to auxin, however of much elevated intensity; as for auxin - no

currently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets.
The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activation
functions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with the
use of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classification of
similar input examples. During the training process, these subnetworks avoid
overfitting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they
must share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we
have made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance
of such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial
distribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear
activation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear
activation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can
result in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions.
Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial
distribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the
introduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks
with piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these
activation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with
a relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch
normalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models. We
show that by introducing maxout and batch normalisation units to the network in
network model results in a model that produces classification results that are
better than or comparable to the current state of the art in CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, MNIST, and SVHN datasets.

motivated by a dynamo experiment currently under development at

generating a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo will be investigated in a cylinder
filled with liquid sodium and simultaneously rotating around two axes. In this
study, we focus on the emergence of non-axisymmetric time-dependent flow
structures in terms of inertial waves which - in cylindrical geometry - form
so-called Kelvin modes. For a precession ratio
${\rm{Po}}=\Omega_p/\Omega_c=0.014$ the amplitude of the forced Kelvin mode
reaches up to one fourth of the rotation velocity of the cylindrical container
confirming that precession provides a rather efficient flow driving mechanism
even at moderate values of ${\rm{Po}}$. More relevant for dynamo action might
be free Kelvin modes with higher azimuthal wave number. These free Kelvin modes
are triggered by non-linear interactions and may constitute a triadic resonance
with the fundamental forced mode when the height of the container matches their
axial wave lengths. Our simulations reveal triadic resonances at aspect ratios
close to those predicted by the linear theory except around the primary
resonance of the forced mode. In that regime we still identify various free
Kelvin modes, however, all of them exhibit a retrograde drift around the
symmetry axis of the cylinder and none of them can be assigned to a triadic
resonance. The amplitudes of the free Kelvin modes always remain below the
forced mode but may reach up to 6% of the of the container's angular velocity.
The properties of the free Kelvin modes will be used in future simulations of
the magnetic induction equation to investigate their ability to provide for
dynamo action.

$f$-divergences relies on moment inequalities and the logarithmic-convexity
property, which results in tight bounds on the relative entropy and
Bhattacharyya distance in terms of $\chi^2$ divergences. A rich variety of
bounds are shown to hold under boundedness assumptions on the relative

its relation to the relative information and relative entropy, including
""reverse Pinsker inequalities,"" as well as on the $E_\gamma$ divergence, which
generalizes the total variation distance. Pinsker's inequality is extended for
this type of $f$-divergence, a result which leads to an inequality linking the

based on the comparison of the distribution of energy barriers for

that the mean dipolar field acting on each single particle is significantly
reduced when particles magnetizations are collinearly aligned. Besides, the

to make dipolar interactions negligible. Interestingly, the results of the

other methods in the literature parametrize spectral envelope in cepstral
domain such as Mel-generalized cepstrum etc. Such cepstral domain
representations, although compact, are not readily interpretable. This
difficulty is overcome by our method which parametrizes in the spectral domain
itself. In our experiments, spectral envelope estimated using MSASB method was
incorporated in the STRAIGHT vocoder. Both objective and subjective results of

STRAIGHT. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed parametrization in
a statistical parametric speech synthesis framework using deep neural networks.

consider a particular case that the deep trap is located at the central node,
and derive an exact formula for the average trapping time (ATT) defined as the
average of the source-to-trap mean first passage time over all starting points.
Then, using the obtained result we deduce a closed-form expression for the ATT
to an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain an explicit
solution to the ATT corresponding to the trapping issue with the trap uniformly
distributed in the polymer systems. We show that the trap location has a
substantial influence on the trapping efficiency measured by the ATT, which
increases with the shortest distance from the trap to the central node, a
phenomenon similar to that for compact dendrimers. In contrast to this
resemblance, the leading terms of ATTs for the three trapping problems differ
drastically between extended and compact dendrimers, with the trapping
processes in the extended dendrimers being less efficient than in compact
dendrimers.

the Quantified Self movement, where individuals log everything ranging from the
number of steps they have taken, to their heart rate, to their sleeping
patterns. Sensors do not, however, typically sense the social and ambient
environment of the users, such as general life style attributes or information
about their social network. This means that the users themselves, and the
medical practitioners, privy to the wearable sensor data, only have a narrow
view of the individual, limited mainly to certain aspects of their physical
condition.
  In this paper we describe a number of use cases for how social media can be
used to complement the check-up data and those from sensors to gain a more
holistic view on individuals' health, a perspective we call the 360 Quantified
Self. Health-related information can be obtained from sources as diverse as
food photo sharing, location check-ins, or profile pictures. Additionally,
information from a person's ego network can shed light on the social dimension
of wellbeing which is widely acknowledged to be of utmost importance, even
though they are currently rarely used for medical diagnosis. We articulate a
long-term vision describing the desirable list of technical advances and
variety of data to achieve an integrated system encompassing Electronic Health

it has been driven by larger budgets rather than adoption of new complex AI

key limiting factors for further AI improvements. In this paper we address this

behaviors for large OWGs. Behavior objects are inspired by object-oriented
programming and extend the concept of smart objects. Our approach promotes
encapsulation of data and code for multiple related behaviors in one place,
hiding internal details and embedding intelligence in the environment. Behavior
objects are a natural abstraction of five different techniques that we have
implemented to manage AI complexity in an upcoming AAA OWG. We report the

(1977) to the context of the normal form theory and its modern techniques.
First, we make use of Delaunay variables for a physically accurate
representation of the system. Therefore, we introduce a novel manipulation of
the variables so as to respect the natural behavior of the model. We develop a
normalization procedure over the fast angle which exploits the fact that
singularities in this model are essentially related to the slow angle. Thus, we
produce a new normal form, i.e. an integrable approximation to the Hamiltonian.
We emphasize some practical examples of the applicability of our normalizing
scheme, e.g. the estimation of the stable libration region. Finally, we compare
the level curves produced by our normal form with surfaces of section provided
by the integration of the non--normalized Hamiltonian, with very good
agreement. Further precision tests are also provided. In addition, we give a
step-by-step description of the algorithm, allowing for extensions to more

multipartite entangled states in the amplitudedamping environment by combining
NRWMs and entanglement distillation protocols (EDPs). We show that the NRWM has

increase the amount of entanglement of each source state (noisy entangled

contribute to remote distributions of multipartite W states. We demonstrate
that the NRWM can not only reduce the fidelity thresholds for distillability of

Eddington luminosity is calculated for self-bound stars (quark star and

Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equations for amplitude and phase fluctuating
configurations of the pairing field. We establish the full thermal phase
diagram of this strong coupling problem, revealing $T_c$ scales an order of
magnitude below the mean field estimate, highlight the spontaneous
inhomogeneity in the field induced magnetization, and discover a strong non
monotonicity in the temperature dependence of the low energy density of states.
We compare our results to the experimental phase diagram of the imbalanced
Fermi gas at unitarity. This paper focuses on the magnetized but homogeneous
(breached pair) superconducting state, a companion paper deals with the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) regime.

to models of multiple quantum impurities coupled to an electronic bath. The
local self-energy is obtained by solving a single-impurity Anderson model in an
effective medium that is determined self-consistently, similar to the dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) for correlated lattice systems. By comparing to exact
results obtained using the numerical renormalization group, we determine
situations where ""impurity-DMFT"" is able to capture the physics of highly
inhomogeneous systems, and those cases where it fails. For two magnetic
impurities separated in real-space, the onset of the dilute limit is captured,
but RKKY-dominated inter-impurity singlet formation cannot be described. For
parallel quantum dot devices, impurity-DMFT succeeds in capturing underscreened
Kondo physics by self-consistent generation of a critical pseudogapped
effective medium. However, the quantum phase transition between high- and
low-spin states on tuning interdot coupling cannot be described.

striking connections to classical formal language theory. Our main results are
the following: (1) We show that Dyck polynomials (defined from the Dyck
languages of formal language theory) are complete for the class
$\mathrm{VP}_{nc}$ under $\le_{abp}$ reductions. Likewise, it turns out that
$\mathrm{PAL}$ (Palindrome polynomials defined from palindromes) are complete
for the class $\mathrm{VSKEW}_{nc}$ (defined by polynomial-size skew circuits)
under $\le_{abp}$ reductions. The proof of these results is by suitably
adapting the classical Chomsky-Sch\""{u}tzenberger theorem showing that Dyck
languages are the hardest CFLs. (2) Next, we consider the class
$\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$. It is known~\cite{HWY10a} that, assuming the
sum-of-squares conjecture, the noncommutative polynomial
$\sum_{w\in\{x_0,x_1\}^n}ww$ requires exponential size circuits. We
unconditionally show that $\sum_{w\in\{x_0,x_1\}^n}ww$ is not
$\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$-complete under the projection reducibility. As a
consequence, assuming the sum-of-squares conjecture, we exhibit a strictly
infinite hierarchy of p-families under projections inside $\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$
(analogous to Ladner's theorem~\cite{Ladner75}). In the final section we
discuss some new $\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$-complete problems under
$\le_{abp}$-reductions. (3) Inside $\mathrm{VP}_{nc}$ too we show there is a
strict hierarchy of p-families (based on the nesting depth of Dyck polynomials)

parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces can be applied. The symmetry of the
double covered surface preserves the efficiency of the computation. A planar
parameterization can then be obtained with the aid of a M\""obius transformation

normal state pseudogap, increasing imbalance reveals anomalous spectral
behavior. At a fixed weak imbalance (small polarization) the stable homogeneous
superfluid occurs only above a certain temperature. The density of states has a
minimum at the Fermi level, then a weak peak {\it within the gap}, and then the
large, gap edge, coherence features. On heating, this non monotonic energy
dependence changes to a more conventional fluctuation driven pseudogap, with a
monotonic energy dependence. At large imbalance the ground state is FFLO and
`pseudogapped' due to the modulated order. It changes to a gapless normal state
on heating, and then shows a pseudogap again at a higher temperature. These
weak imbalance and strong imbalance features both involve effects well beyond
mean field theory. We establish them by using a Monte Carlo technique on large

an earlier result for hypersurfaces in a projective homogeneous variety,
whereby the chains are cycles. In light of this result, the mixed Hodge

characteristic features from miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). The short length of
miRNA genes and the lack of pronounced sequence features complicate this task.
To accommodate the peculiarities of plant and animal miRNAs systems, tools for
both systems have evolved differently. However, these tools are biased towards
the species for which they were primarily developed and, consequently, their
predictive performance on data sets from other species of the same kingdom
might be lower. While these biases are intrinsic to the species, the
characterization of their occurrence can lead to computational approaches able
to diminish their negative effect on the accuracy of pre-miRNAs predictive
models. Here, we investigate in this study how 45 predictive models induced for
data sets from 45 species, distributed in eight subphyla, perform when applied
to a species different from the species used in its induction. Our
computational experiments show that the separability of pre-miRNAs and pseudo
pre-miRNAs instances is species-dependent and no feature set performs well for
all species, even within the same subphylum. Mitigating this species
dependency, we show that an ensemble of classifiers reduced the classification
errors for all 45 species. As the ensemble members were obtained using
meaningful, and yet computationally viable feature sets, the ensembles also
have a lower computational cost than individual classifiers that rely on energy
stability parameters, which are of prohibitive computational cost in large
scale applications. In this study, the combination of multiple pre-miRNAs
feature sets and multiple learning biases enhanced the predictive accuracy of
pre-miRNAs classifiers of 45 species. This is certainly a promising approach to

identifying emotion from natural walking, and analyze the relevance between the
traits of walking and affective states. After obtaining the pure acceleration
data of wrist and ankle, we set a moving average filter window with different
sizes w, then extract 114 features including time-domain, frequency-domain,
power and distribution features from each data slice, and run principal
component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimension. In experiments, we train SVM,
Decision Tree, multilayerperception, Random Tree and Random Forest
classification models, and compare the classification accuracy on data of wrist
and ankle with respect to different w. The performance of emotion
identification on acceleration data of ankle is better than wrist.Comparing
different classification models' results, SVM has best accuracy of identifying
anger and happy could achieve 90:31% and 89:76% respectively, and
identification ratio of anger-happy is 87:10%.The anger-neutral-happy
classification reaches 85%-78%-78%.The results show that it is capable of
identifying personal emotional states through the gait of walking.

frequency harmonic in searches for gravitational waves from spinning neutron
stars. We assume emission is given by the general triaxial non-aligned model of
Jones, whose waveform under certain conditions reduces to that of a biaxial
precessing star, or a simple rigidly rotating triaxial aligned star. The
triaxial non-aligned and biaxial models can produce emission at both the star's
rotation frequency ($f$) and $2f$, whilst the latter only emits at $2f$. We
have studied parameter estimation for signal models using both a set of
physical source parameters, and a set of waveform parameters that remove a
degeneracy. We have assessed the signal detection efficiency, and used Bayesian
model selection to investigate how well we can distinguish between the three
models. We found that for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) $\gtrsim 6$ there is no
significant loss in efficiency if performing a search for a signal at $f$ and
$2f$ when the source is only producing emission at $2f$. However, for sources
with emission at both $f$ and $2f$ signals could be missed by a search only at
$2f$. We also find that for a triaxial aligned source, the correct model is
always favoured, but for a triaxial non-aligned source it can be hard to
distinguish between the triaxial non-aligned model and the biaxial model, even
at high SNR. Finally, we apply the method to a selection of known pulsars using
data from the LIGO fifth science run. We give the first upper limits on
gravitational wave amplitude at both $f$ and $2f$ and apply the model selection

unprecedented fine detail. We could precisely identify three climate state
transition regions that are associated with phase transitions in standing
tropical and extra tropical Rossby waves.
  We confirm that the climate on fast rotating planets may assume multiple
states ($P_{rot}\leq 12$ days for $R_P=2 R_{Earth}$). Our study is, however,
the first to identify the type of planetary wave associated with different
climate states: The first state is dominated by standing tropical Rossby waves
with fast equatorial superrotation. The second state is dominated by standing
extra tropical Rossby waves with high latitude westerly jets with slower wind
speeds. For very fast rotations ($P_{rot}\leq 5$~days for $R_P=2 R_{Earth}$),
we find another climate state transition, where the standing tropical and extra
tropical Rossby wave can both fit on the planet. Thus, a third state with a
mixture of the two planetary waves becomes possible that exhibits three jets.
  Different climate states may be observable, because the upper atmosphere's
hot spot is eastward shifted with respect to the substellar point in the first
state, westward shifted in the second state and the third state shows a
longitudinal 'smearing' of the spot across the substellar point.
  We show, furthermore, that the largest fast rotating planet in our study
exhibits atmosphere features known from hot Jupiters like fast equatorial
superrotation and a temperature chevron in the upper atmosphere.

retrieved in neural populations is a central challenge in neuroscience. A
popular theoretical scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor
neural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield model. The model has a
poor storage capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with perceptron
learning algorithms. Here, by transforming the perceptron learning rule, we
present an online learning rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves
near-maximal storage capacity without an explicit supervisory error signal,
relying only upon locally accessible information. The fully-connected network
consists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic recurrent connections and
non-plastic inhibitory feedback stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory
patterns are presented online as strong afferent currents, producing a bimodal
distribution for the neuron synaptic inputs. Synapses corresponding to active
inputs are modified as a function of the value of the local fields with respect
to three thresholds. Above the highest threshold, and below the lowest
threshold, no plasticity occurs. In between these two thresholds,
potentiation/depression occurs when the local field is above/below an
intermediate threshold. We simulated and analyzed a network of binary neurons
implementing this rule and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of
the basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained through numerical
simulations is shown to be close to the value predicted by analytical
calculations. We also measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of
external inputs. Finally, we quantified the statistics of the resulting
synaptic connectivity matrix, and found that both the fraction of zero weight
synapses and the degree of symmetry of the weight matrix increase with the

spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry obeys a Nambu-Goto effective
Lagrangian $\sqrt{1 - (\partial_0 Z)^2}$ detecting the speed of light
($|\partial_0 Z|=1$) in the target spacetime. Solitons can have internal moduli
parameters as well, associated with a breaking of internal symmetries such as a
phase rotation acting on a field. We obtain, for generic domain walls, an
effective Lagrangian of the internal moduli $\epsilon$ to all order in
$(\partial \epsilon)$. The Lagrangian is given by a function of the Nambu-Goto
Lagrangian: $L = g(\sqrt{1 + (\partial_\mu \epsilon)^2})$. This shows
generically the existence of an upper bound on $\partial_0 \epsilon$, i.e. a
speed limit in the internal space. The speed limit exists even for solitons in
some non-relativistic field theories, where we find that $\epsilon$ is a type I
Nambu-Goldstone mode which also obeys a nonlinear dispersion to reach the speed
limit. This offers a possibility of detecting the speed limit in condensed
matter experiments.

requiring fewer computation steps than their classical counterparts. We extend
their representation to the process of setting the problem. The initial

changes it into the desired one. This representation is to Bob and any external
observer, it cannot be to Alice (the problem solver). It would tell her the
function computed by the black box, which to her should be hidden inside it. We
resort to relational quantum mechanics. To Alice, the projection of the quantum
state due to the initial measurement is retarded at the end of her problem
solving action. To her, the algorithm input state remains one of complete
ignorance of the setting. By black box computations, she unitarily sends it
into the output state that, for each possible setting, encodes the
corresponding solution, acquired by the final measurement. We show that we can
ascribe to the final measurement the selection of any part -- say the R-th part
-- of the random outcome of the initial measurement. This projects the input
state to Alice on a state of lower entropy where she knows a corresponding part
of the problem setting. The quantum algorithm is a sum over classical histories
in each of which Alice, knowing in advance one of the R-th parts of the
setting, performs the black box computations still required to identify the
solution. Given an oracle problem and a value of R, this retrocausality model
provides the number of black box computations required to solve it. Conversely,
given a known quantum algorithm, it yields the value of R that explains its
speed up. R = 1/2 always yields the number of black box computations required
by an existing quantum algorithm and the order of magnitude of the number

optical engineers need to tune the recording parameters to get as many optimal
solutions as possible for multiple trials in the varied-line-spacing
holographic grating design problem. Unfortunately, most traditional
optimization techniques focus on solving for a single optimal solution. They
need to be applied several times; yet all solutions are not guaranteed to be
found. Thus the multimodal optimization problem was proposed. In that problem,
we are interested in not only a single optimal point, but also the others. With
strong parallel search capability, evolutionary algorithms are shown to be
particularly effective in solving this type of problem. In particular, the
evolutionary algorithms for multimodal optimization usually not only locate
multiple optima in a single run, but also preserve their population diversity
throughout a run, resulting in their global optimization ability on multimodal
functions. In addition, the techniques for multimodal optimization are borrowed
as diversity maintenance techniques to other problems. In this chapter, we
describe and review the state-of-the-arts evolutionary algorithms for
multimodal optimization in terms of methodology, benchmarking, and application.

essential in learning genome-wide biological insights. Especially, the
functional characterization of different genomes is essential for us to
understand lives. In this book chapter, we review the state-of-the-art
unsupervised learning algorithms for genome informatics from DNA to MicroRNA.
  DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) is the basic component of genomes. A significant
fraction of DNA regions (transcription factor binding sites) are bound by
proteins (transcription factors) to regulate gene expression at different
development stages in different tissues. To fully understand genetics, it is
necessary of us to apply unsupervised learning algorithms to learn and infer
those DNA regions. Here we review several unsupervised learning methods for
deciphering the genome-wide patterns of those DNA regions.
  MicroRNA (miRNA), a class of small endogenous non-coding RNA (RiboNucleic
acid) species, regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by forming
imperfect base-pair with the target sites primarily at the 3$'$ untranslated
regions of the messenger RNAs. Since the 1993 discovery of the first miRNA
\emph{let-7} in worms, a vast amount of studies have been dedicated to
functionally characterizing the functional impacts of miRNA in a network
context to understand complex diseases such as cancer. Here we review several
representative unsupervised learning frameworks on inferring miRNA regulatory
network by exploiting the static sequence-based information pertinent to the
prior knowledge of miRNA targeting and the dynamic information of miRNA
activities implicated by the recently available large data compendia, which
interrogate genome-wide expression profiles of miRNAs and/or mRNAs across
various cell conditions.

holes in $f(R)$ gravity. We transform $f(R)$ gravity from the Jordan frame into
the Einstein frame and simulate scalar collapses in flat, Schwarzschild, and
Reissner-Nordstr\""om geometries. In simulating scalar collapses in
Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\""om geometries, Kruskal and Kruskal-like
coordinates are used, respectively, with the presence of $f'$ and a physical
scalar field being taken into account. The dynamics in the vicinities of the
central singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole and of the inner horizon of a
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole is examined. Approximate analytic solutions for
different types of collapses are partially obtained. The scalar degree of
freedom $\phi$, transformed from $f'$, plays a similar role as a physical
scalar field in general relativity. Regarding the physical scalar field in
$f(R)$ case, when $d\phi/dt$ is negative (positive), the physical scalar field
is suppressed (magnified) by $\phi$, where $t$ is the coordinate time. For dark
energy $f(R)$ gravity, inside black holes, gravity can easily push $f'$ to $1$.
Consequently, the Ricci scalar $R$ becomes singular, and the numerical
simulation breaks down. This singularity problem can be avoided by adding an
$R^2$ term to the original $f(R)$ function, in which case an infinite Ricci
scalar is pushed to regions where $f'$ is also infinite. On the other hand, in
collapse for this combined model, a black hole, including a central
singularity, can be formed. Moreover, under certain initial conditions, $f'$
and $R$ can be pushed to infinity as the central singularity is approached.
Therefore, the classical singularity problem, which is present in general
relativity, remains in collapse for this combined model.

dynamic view of how viruses evade host immunity. Immune-driven mutations might
stimulate neutralization breadth by selecting antibodies adapted to cycles of
immune escape that generate within-subject epitope diversity. Comprehensive
identification of immune-escape mutations is experimentally and computationally
challenging. With current technology, many more viral sequences can readily be
obtained than can be tested for binding and neutralization, making
down-selection necessary. Typically, this is done manually, by picking variants
that represent different time-points and branches on a phylogenetic tree. Such
strategies are likely to miss many relevant mutations and combinations of
mutations, and to be redundant for other mutations. Longitudinal Antigenic
Sequences and Sites from Intrahost Evolution (LASSIE) uses transmitted-founder

sequences that represent recurrent mutations in selected sites. LASSIE favors
earliest sequences in which mutations arise. With well-characterized
longitudinal Env sequences, we confirmed selected sites were concentrated in

accompanied by alterations in the spatiotemporal pattern of electrical activity
that can be measured by observing the time-intervals between successive
excitations of different regions of the cardiac tissue. Using biophysically
detailed models of cardiac activity we show that the distribution of these
time-intervals exhibit a systematic change in their skewness during such
dynamical transitions. Further, the leading digits of the normalized intervals
appear to fit Benford's law better at these transition points. This raises the
possibility of using these observations to design a clinical indicator for
identifying changes in the nature of arrhythmia. More importantly, our results
reveal an intriguing relation between the changing skewness of a distribution
and its agreement with Benford's law, both of which have been independently
proposed earlier as indicators of regime shift in dynamical systems.

map to previous 3mm PdBI data, and now the new 1.07mm continuum observations,
the sub-structures hierarchically fragment on the increasingly smaller spatial
scales. While the fragment separations may still be roughly consistent with
pure thermal Jeans fragmentation, the derived core masses are almost two orders
of magnitude larger than the typical Jeans mass at the given densities and
temperatures. However, the data can be reconciled with models using
non-homogeneous initial density structures, turbulence and/or magnetic fields.
While most sub-cores remain (far-)infrared dark even at 70mum, we identify weak
70mum emission toward one core with a comparably low luminosity of ~16L_sun,
re-enforcing the general youth of the region. The spectral line data always
exhibit multiple spectral components toward each core with comparably small
line widths for the individual components (in the 0.3 to 1.0km/s regime). Based
on single-dish C18O(2-1) data we estimate a low virial-to-gas-mass ratio
<=0.25. We discuss that the likely origin of these spectral properties may be
the global collapse of the original gas clump that results in multiple spectral
components along each line of sight. Even within this dynamic picture the
individual collapsing gas cores appear to have very low levels of internal
turbulence.

Nash equilibrium seeking strategies are proposed for the electricity users. By
using singular perturbation analysis and Lyapunov stability analysis, a local
