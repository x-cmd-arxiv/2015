the range of possible allowed CP-violating phases by taking into account the

phases, that are NMSSM-specific, are not in conflict with the EDMs. They are

  structure","Ph.D. dissertation; 160 pages, 34 figures, 4 tables",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new observable, position-dependent power spectrum, to measure
the large-scale structure bispectrum in the squeezed configuration, where one
wavenumber is much smaller than the other two. The squeezed-limit bispectrum
measures how the small-scale power spectrum is modulated by a long-wavelength
overdensity, which is due to gravitational evolution and possibly inflationary
physics. We divide a survey into small subvolumes, compute the local power
spectrum and the mean overdensity in each subvolume, and measure the
correlation between them. The correlation measures the integral of the
bispectrum, which is dominated by squeezed configurations if the scale of the
local power spectrum is much smaller than the subvolume size. We use the
separate universe approach to model how the small-scale power spectrum is
affected by a long-wavelength overdensity gravitationally. This models the
nonlinearity of the bispectrum better than the perturbation theory approach.
Not only the new observable is easy to interpret, but it sidesteps the
complexity of the full bispectrum estimation as both power spectrum and mean
overdensity are easier to estimate than the full bispectrum. We report on the
first measurement of the position-dependent correlation function from the
SDSS-III BOSS DR10 CMASS sample. We detect the bispectrum of the CMASS sample,
and constrain their nonlinear bias combining with anisotropic clustering and
weak lensing. We finally study the response of the small-scale power spectrum
to 1-3 long-wavelength overdensities. We compare the separate universe approach
to separate universe simulations to unprecedented accuracy. We test the
standard perturbation theory (SPT) hypothesis that the nonlinear n-point
function is fully predicted by the linear power spectrum at the same time. We
find discrepancies on small scales, which suggest that SPT fails even if it is
calculated to all orders.

known for years. The advantage over regular Toffoli gate is their smaller
circuit size. However, their use has been often limited to a demonstration of
quantum control in designs such as those where the Toffoli gate is being
applied last or otherwise for some specific reasons the relative phase does not
matter. It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would
prevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical
large-scale designs.
  In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for
replacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with
their simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on
certain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality. We illustrate
the advantage via applying those identities to the optimization of the known

bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR)-oscillator-based 4.596~GHz frequency
source. A 2.298~GHz signal, generated by an oscillator constructed around a
thermally-controlled two-port AlN-sapphire HBAR resonator with a Q-factor of
24000 at 68$^{\circ}$C, is frequency multiplied by 2 to 4.596~GHz, half of the
Cs atom clock frequency. The temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of the
HBAR is measured to be $-23$~ppm/$^{\circ}$C at 2.298~GHz. The measured phase
noise of the 4.596~GHz source is $-105$~dBrad$^2$/Hz at 1~kHz offset and
$-150$~dBrad$^2$/Hz at 100~kHz offset. The 4.596~GHz output signal is used as a
local oscillator (LO) in a laboratory-prototype Cs microcell-based coherent
population trapping (CPT) atomic clock. The signal is stabilized onto the
atomic transition frequency by tuning finely a voltage-controlled phase shifter
(VCPS) implemented in the 2.298~GHz HBAR-oscillator loop, preventing the need
for a high-power-consuming direct digital synthesis (DDS). The short-term
fractional frequency stability of the free-running oscillator is 1.8 $\times$
10$^{-9}$ at one second integration time. In locked regime, the latter is
improved in a preliminary proof-of-concept experiment at the level of 6.6
$\times$ 10$^{-11}~\tau^{-1/2}$ up to a few seconds and found to be limited by
the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected CPT resonance.

is the smallest number of limits needed in the computation, yielding a
classification hierarchy for all types of problems in computational mathematics

computational problems that can be used in computer-assisted proofs. The SCI
hierarchy captures many key computational issues in the history of mathematics

iterative generally convergent algorithm for polynomial root finding, the

evidence for the presence of star forming or non-stellar components. If a UV
excess due to an extra radiation component exists we compare this with other
properties such as radio power, optical spectral type and the strength of the
emission lines. We also discuss the possible correlation between the
ultra-violet flux, IR properties and central black hole mass. We use two sampes
of low luminosity radio galaxies with comparable redshifts ($z < 0.2$).
Spectral Energy Distributions are constructed using a number of on-line
databases: GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE. The parameter $XUV$ is introduced,
which measures the excess slope of the UV continuum between 4500 and 2000 \AA,
with respect to the UV radiation produced by the underlying old galaxy
component.
  We find that the UV excess is usually small or absent in low luminosity
sources, but sets in abruptly at the transition radio power above which we find
mostly FRII sources. $XUV$ behaves very similarly to the strength of the
optical emission lines (in particular $H\alpha$). Below $P_{1.4 GHz} < 10^{24}$
WHz$^{-1}$ $XUV$ is close to zero. $XUV$ correlates strongly with the $H\alpha$
line strength, but only in sources with strong $H\alpha$ emission. There is a
strong correlation between $XUV$ and the slope of the mid-IR, as measured by
the WISE bands in the interval 3.4 to 22 $\mu$m, in the sense that sources with
a strong UV excess also have stronger IR emission. There is an inverse
correlation between $XUV$ and central black hole mass: strong UV excess objects
have, on average, $M_{BH}$ about 2-3 times less massive than those without UV
excess. Low luminosity radio galaxies tend to be more massive and contain more
massive black holes.

and 5-flavor schemes. It contains the full 4-flavor result, including the exact
dependence on the $b$-quark mass, and improves it with a resummation of
collinear logarithms of $m_b/m_H$. In the massless limit, it corresponds to a
reorganized 5-flavor result. While we focus on $b\bar{b}H$ production, our
method applies to generic heavy-quark initiated processes at hadron colliders.
Our setup resembles the variable flavor number schemes known from heavy-flavor
production in deep-inelastic scattering, but also differs in some key aspects.
Most importantly, the effective $b$-quark PDF appears as part of the
perturbative expansion of the final result where it effectively counts as an
$O(\alpha_s)$ object. The transition between the fixed-order (4-flavor) and
resummation (5-flavor) regimes is governed by the low matching scale at which
the $b$-quark is integrated out. Varying this scale provides a systematic way
to assess the perturbative uncertainties associated with the resummation and
matching procedure and reduces by going to higher orders. We discuss the
practical implementation and present numerical results for the $b\bar{b}H$
production cross section at NLO+NLL. We also provide a comparison to the
corresponding predictions in the fixed 4-flavor and 5-flavor results and the
Santander matching prescription. Compared to the latter, we find a slightly
reduced uncertainty and a larger central value, with its central value lying at
the lower edge of our uncertainty band.

range of transport parameters using quantum circuit theory. The gap closes
inside an area of the space spanned by the superconducting phase differences.
We derive an approximate analytic expression for the boundary of the area and
compare it to the full numerical solution. The size of the area increases with
the transparency of the junction and is sensitive to asymmetry. The finite
density of states at zero energy is unaffected by electron-hole decoherence
present in the junction, although decoherence is important at higher energies.
Our predictions can be tested using tunneling transport spectroscopy. To
encourage experiments, we calculate the current-voltage characteristic in a
typical measurement setup. We show how the structure of the local density of

by von Neumann is adapted to obtain a natural thermodynamic entropy definition,
following a proposal by J. Barrett. Mathematical properties of this entropy are
compared to physical consequences of the thought experiment. The validity of
the second law of thermodynamics is investigated. In that context, observables
and projective measurements are generalized to prove an entropy increase for
projective measurements of ensembles. Information-theoretically motivated
definitions of the entropy are compared to the entropy from the thermodynamic
thought experiment. The conditions for the thermodynamic entropy to be
well-defined are considered in greater detail. Several further properties of
the theories under consideration (e.g. whether there is higher order
interference, Pfister's state discrimination principle) and their relation to
entropy are investigated.

the growth of the superconducting into the normal region and associated
expulsion of magnetic field from the superconducting region can only be
understood if it is accompanied by motion of charge from the superconducting
into the normal region. From a microscopic point of view it is shown that the
perfect diamagnetism of superconductors requires that superconducting electrons
reside in orbits of spatial extent $2\lambda_L$, with $\lambda_L$ the London
penetration depth. Associated with this physics, the spin-orbit interaction of
the electron magnetic moment and the positively charged ionic background gives
rise to a ""Spin Meissner"" effect, the generation of a macroscopic spin current
near the surface of superconductors. We point out that both the Meissner and
the Spin Meissner effect can be understood dynamically under the assumption
that the superfluid condensate wavefunction $\Psi(\vec{r})$ does not screen
itself, just like the $\Psi(\vec{r})$ for an electron in a hydrogen atom. We
argue that the conventional theory of superconductivity cannot explain the

production of nova progenitor binaries in the dense cores of its globular
clusters (GCs). To explore this idea, relative nova rates in three Virgo
elliptical galaxies, M87, M49 and M84, which have significantly different GC
specific frequencies ($S_{N}$) of 14, 3.6, and 1.6, respectively, were measured
over the course of 4 epochs spanning a period of 14 months. To simplify the
analysis, observations of the nearly equidistant galaxies were made on the same
nights, with the same integration times, and through the same filter
(H$\alpha$), so that the relative numbers of novae discovered would reflect the
relative nova rates. At the conclusion of our survey we found a total of 27
novae associated with M87, 37 with M49, and 19 with M84. After correcting for
survey completeness, we found annual nova rates of $154^{+23}_{-19}$,
$189^{+26}_{-22}$, and $95^{+15}_{-14}$, for M87, M49, and M84, respectively,
corresponding to $K$-band luminosity-specific nova rates of $3.8\pm1.0$,
$3.4\pm0.6$, and $3.0\pm0.6$ novae per year per $10^{10}~L_{K,\odot}$. The
overall results of our study suggest that a galaxy's nova rate simply scales
with its luminosity, and is insensitive to its GC specific frequency. Two
novae, one in M87 and one in M84, were found to be spatially coincident with
known GCs. After correcting for the mass fraction in GCs, we estimate that
novae are likely enhanced relative to the field by at least an order of
magnitude in the GC systems of luminous Virgo ellipticals.

than the $J/\psi$, the existence of a state $X(4630)$ that decays to
$\Lambda_c$ baryon pairs, and why some but not all exotics lie near hadronic
thresholds. Owing to high-energy constituent counting rules, the four-quark

electroweak symmetry breaking whereas in the other regime electroweak symmetry
is mainly broken by a Higgs source term. While the latter is not acceptable in
a model based on the QCD axion, in non-QCD models this may lead to new and
interesting signatures in Higgs observables.

with class-specific probabilities and subsequently share the associated costs
of sanctioning. We show that in the presence of different punishing cooperators
the highest level of public cooperation is always attainable through a
selection mechanism. Interestingly, the selection not necessarily favors the
evolution of punishers who would be able to prevail on their own against the
defectors, nor does it always hinder the evolution of punishers who would be
unable to prevail on their own. Instead, the evolutionary success of punishing
strategies depends sensitively on their invasion velocities, which in turn
reveals fascinating examples of both competition and cooperation among them.
Furthermore, we show that under favorable conditions, when punishment is not
strictly necessary for the maintenance of public cooperation, the less
aggressive, mild form of sanctioning is the sole victor of selection process.
Our work reveals that natural strategy selection can not only promote, but
sometimes also hinder competition among prosocial strategies.

infinite-energy solution of 3D Euler equations of stagnation-point-type
introduced by Gibbon et al. (1999). By employing the method of mapping to
regular systems, presented in Bustamante (2011) and extended to the
symmetry-plane case by Mulungye et al. (2015), we establish a curious property
of this solution that was not observed in early studies: before but near
singularity time, the blowup goes from a fast transient to a slower regime that
is well resolved spectrally, even at mid-resolutions of $512^2.$ This late-time
regime has an atypical spectrum: it is Gaussian rather than exponential in the
wavenumbers. The analyticity-strip width decays to zero in a finite time,
albeit so slowly that it remains well above the collocation-point scale for all
simulation times $t < T^* - 10^{-9000}$, where $T^*$ is the singularity time.
Reaching such a proximity to singularity time is not possible in the original
temporal variable, because floating point double precision ($\approx 10^{-16}$)
creates a `machine-epsilon' barrier. Due to this limitation on the
\emph{original} independent variable, the mapped variables now provide an
improved assessment of the relevant blowup quantities, crucially with
acceptable accuracy at an unprecedented closeness to the singularity time:
$T^*- t \approx 10^{-140}.$

of usable data, learning each task independently may lead to poor
generalization performance. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) exploits the latent
relations between tasks and overcomes data scarcity limitations by co-learning
all these tasks simultaneously to offer improved performance. We propose a
novel Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning framework based on Support Vector
Machines for binary classification tasks. By considering pair-wise task
affinity in terms of similarity between a pair's respective feature spaces, the
new framework, compared to other similar MTL approaches, offers a high degree
of flexibility in determining how similar feature spaces should be, as well as
which pairs of tasks should share a common feature space in order to benefit
overall performance. The associated optimization problem is solved via a block
coordinate descent, which employs a consensus-form Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers algorithm to optimize the Multiple Kernel Learning weights and,
hence, to determine task affinities. Empirical evaluation on seven data sets
exhibits a statistically significant improvement of our framework's results

patterns of collective motion, the current battery of nonlinear dimensionality
reduction methods are not amenable to the analysis of such manifolds. This is
mainly due to the necessary spectral decomposition step, which limits control
over the mapping from the original high-dimensional space to the embedding
space. Here, we propose an alternative approach that demands a two-dimensional
embedding which topologically summarizes the high-dimensional data. In this
sense, our approach is closely related to the construction of one-dimensional
principal curves that minimize orthogonal error to data points subject to
smoothness constraints. Specifically, we construct a two-dimensional principal
manifold directly in the high-dimensional space using cubic smoothing splines,
and define the embedding coordinates in terms of geodesic distances. Thus, the
mapping from the high-dimensional data to the manifold is defined in terms of
local coordinates. Through representative examples, we show that compared to
existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, the principal manifold
retains the original structure even in noisy and sparse datasets. The principal
manifold finding algorithm is applied to configurations obtained from a
dynamical system of multiple agents simulating a complex maneuver called
predator mobbing, and the resulting two-dimensional embedding is compared with
that of a well-established nonlinear dimensionality reduction method.

consider a gas blob or ring falling onto a black hole from the marginally
stable orbit, keeping its initial orbital angular momentum. We calculate the
gas motion and photon trajectories in the Kerr space-time and, assuming that
the gas blob or ring emits monochromatic radiation, carefully examine how it is
observed by a distant observer. The light curve of the orbiting gas blob is
composed of many peaks because of periodic enhancement of the flux due to the
gravitational lensing and beaming effects. Further, the intensity of each peak
first gradually increases with time due to the focusing effect around the
photon circular orbit and then rapidly decreases due to the gravitational
redshift, as the gas blob approaches the event horizon. The light curve of the
gas ring is equivalent to a superposition of those of the blobs with various
initial orbital phases, and so it is continuous and with no peaks. The flux
first gradually increases and then rapidly decays, as in the blob model. The
flux variation timescale depends on the black hole spin and is independent from
the inclination angle, while time averaged frequency shift have dependences of
both effects. We can thus, in principle, determine spin and inclination angle
from observations. The observational implications and future issues are briefly
discussed.

of the different order parameters. One of them has a minimum frequency that is
within the single particle energy gap and which is a non-monotonic function of
temperature. The other -- high-frequency -- mode is smoothly connected to the
Higgs mode in the single-order-parameter region, but quickly becomes overdamped
in the case of coexistence. We explore an unusual low-energy damping channel
for the collective modes, which relies on the band reconstruction caused by the
coexistence of the two orders. For completeness, we also consider the damping
of the collective modes originating from the nodal quasiparticles. At the end
we discuss some experimental consequences of our results.

detailed fits to DM halos of galaxies and clusters, we show that
self-interacting DM (SIDM) may provide a consistent solution to the DM deficit
problem across all scales, even though individual systems exhibit a wide
diversity in halo properties. Since the characteristic velocity of DM particles
varies across these systems, we are able to measure the self-interaction cross
section as a function of kinetic energy and thereby deduce the SIDM particle
physics model parameters. Our results prefer a mildly velocity-dependent cross
section, from $\sigma/m \simeq 2\; {\rm cm^2/g}$ on galaxy scales to $\sigma/m
\simeq 0.1\; {\rm cm^2/g}$ on cluster scales, consistent with the upper limits
from merging clusters. Our results dramatically improve the constraints on SIDM

measured even if the dark sector is completely hidden from the Standard Model,

who have partial knowledge about the Lorentz transformation that relates their

a pure boost followed by a rotation, we begin by analysing the effects on
communication when the parties have partial knowledge about the transformation
relating their frames, when the transformation is either a rotation or pure
boost. This then enables us to investigate how the efficiency of communication
is affected due to partially correlated inertial reference frames related by an
arbitrary Lorentz transformation. Furthermore, we show how the results of
previous studies where reference frames are completely uncorrelated are
recovered from our results in appropriate limits.

from ESO 184-G82, the host galaxy of the gamma ray burst 980425. This is the
first instance where HI in emission has been detected from a galaxy hosting a
gamma ray burst. ESO 184-G82 is an isolated galaxy and contains a Wolf-Rayet
region close to the location of the gamma ray burst and the associated
supernova, SN 1998bw. This is one of the most luminous HII regions identified
in the local Universe, with a very high inferred density of star formation. The
HI 21cm observations reveal a high HI mass for the galaxy, twice as large as
the stellar mass. The spatial and velocity distribution of the HI 21cm emission
reveals a disturbed rotating gas disk, which suggests that the galaxy has
undergone a recent minor merger that disrupted its rotation. We find that the
Wolf-Rayet region and the gamma ray burst are both located in the highest HI
column density region of the galaxy. We speculate that the merger event has
resulted in shock compression of the gas, triggering extreme star formation
activity, and resulting in the formation of both the Wolf-Rayet region and the
gamma ray burst. The high HI column density environment of the GRB is
consistent with the high HI column densities seen in absorption in the host
galaxies of high redshift gamma ray bursts.

with the bow shocks produced by its defunct progenitor, and may lose energy,
momentum, and its spherical symmetry before expanding into the local
interstellar medium (ISM). We investigate whether the initial mass and space
velocity of these progenitors can be associated with asymmetric supernova
remnants. We run hydrodynamical models of supernovae exploding in the
pre-shaped medium of moving Galactic core-collapse progenitors. We find that
bow shocks that accumulate more than about 1.5 Mo generate asymmetric remnants.
The shock wave first collides with these bow shocks 160-750 yr after the
supernova, and the collision lasts until 830-4900 yr. The shock wave is then
located 1.35-5 pc from the center of the explosion, and it expands freely into
the ISM, whereas in the opposite direction it is channelled into the region of
undisturbed wind material. This applies to an initially 20 Mo progenitor moving
with velocity 20 km/s and to our initially 40 Mo progenitor. These remnants
generate mixing of ISM gas, stellar wind and supernova ejecta that is
particularly important upstream from the center of the explosion. Their
lightcurves are dominated by emission from optically-thin cooling and by X-ray
emission of the shocked ISM gas. We find that these remnants are likely to be
observed in the [OIII] lambda 5007 spectral line emission or in the soft

networks is studied. Two important properties of local estimates, namely, the
consistency and confidence, are emphasized. On one hand, the consistency, which
means that the approximated error covariance is lower bounded by the true
unknown one, has to be guaranteed so that the estimate is not over-confident.
On the other hand, since the confidence indicates the accuracy of the estimate,
the estimate should be as confident as possible. We first analyze two different
information fusion strategies used in the case of information sources with,
respectively, uncorrelated errors and unknown but correlated errors. Then a
distributed hybrid information fusion algorithm is proposed, where each agent
uses the information obtained not only by itself, but also from its neighbors
through communication. The proposed algorithm not only guarantees the
consistency of the estimates, but also utilizes the available information
sources in a more efficient manner and hence improves the confidence. Besides,
the proposed algorithm is fully distributed and guarantees convergence with the
sufficient condition formulated. The comparisons with existing algorithms are
shown.

small diameters on the surface of which the conduction electron gas is confined
by the electric field generated by the fixed carbon ions. The pair-interaction
potential considered is the 3D Coulomb potential restricted to the cylinder. To
reflect the quasi-1D structure, we introduce a 1D effective many-body

optical properties, we consider a perturbation by a uniform time-dependent

an asymptotic expansion in the low-temperature regime for the dynamical optical
conductivity at fixed density of particles. The leading term only involves the

modulated with orbital phase. During low state a significant component of the
flux, and its spectrum, is consistent with X-ray reflection off the face of the
companion star HZ Her. This component has a significantly harder X-ray spectrum
than the rest of the flux from the Her X-1 system. A second component in low

high a third strong component is present with a softer spectrum, which is
associated with the neutron star and accretion disk. Due to this direct
emission from the neutron star and accretion disk, the reflected emission is
less clear, however parameters and fluxes modulations during short high state
indicate its presence. In low state, the hard X-ray flux ($h \nu$ $>$ $10 keV$)
peaks at orbital phase $\phi_{orb}\simeq$ 0.55, which is expected from a simple

an asymmetry in the X-ray illumination of the companion, which could be due to

single-photon, mode-selective FC are limited to around 80%.In this letter we
argue that these limits can be understood as time-ordering corrections (TOCs)

using a simple scaling argument, that recently proposed cascaded FC protocols
that overcome the aforementioned limitations act as ""attenuators"" of the TOCs.
This observation allows us to argue that very similar cascaded architectures
can be used to attenuate TOCs in photon generation via spontaneous parametric
down-conversion. Finally, by using the Magnus expansion, we argue that the
TOCs, which are usually considered detrimental for FC efficiency, can also be
used to increase the efficiency of conversion in partially mode selective FC.

present a new approach to the construction of instanton solutions interpolating

functions on a two-dimensional space to approximate matrices and it relies on
the same ideas behind the matrix regularisation of membrane degrees of freedom

so follow a renormalization group law due to Aharony and Harris (1991).
Empirically, it is found that the $K_{d}$ values are independent of d to within

independent of L in each dimension, and remarkably the estimated thermodynamic

demonstrate these measures are able to distinguish viral from non-viral

we leverage these measurements as features in a classification approach,
successfully predicting microblogs that grow from 50 to 500 reposts with
precision of 0.69 and recall of 0.52 for the viral class - despite this class
comprising under 2\% of samples. This significantly outperforms our baseline
approach as well as the current state-of-the-art. Our work also demonstrates
how we can tradeoff between precision and recall.

making as a process of noisy evidence accumulation to a decision bound. While
there are several variants and implementations of this idea, the majority of
these models make use of a noisy accumulation between two absorbing boundaries.
A common assumption of these models is that decision parameters, e.g., the rate
of accumulation (drift rate), remain fixed over the course of a decision,
allowing the derivation of analytic formulas for the probabilities of hitting
the upper or lower decision threshold, and the mean decision time. There is
reason to believe, however, that many types of behavior would be better
described by a model in which the parameters were allowed to vary over the
course of the decision process.
  In this paper, we use martingale theory to derive formulas for the mean
decision time, hitting probabilities, and first passage time (FPT) densities of
a Wiener process with time-varying drift between two time-varying absorbing
boundaries. This model was first studied by Ratcliff (1980) in the two-stage
form, and here we consider the same model for an arbitrary number of stages
(i.e. intervals of time during which parameters are constant). Our calculations
enable direct computation of mean decision times and hitting probabilities for
the associated multistage process. We also provide a review of how martingale
theory may be used to analyze similar models employing Wiener processes by
re-deriving some classical results. In concert with a variety of numerical
tools already available, the current derivations should encourage mathematical
analysis of more complex models of decision making with time-varying evidence.

that can be exploited to provide tests of internal consistency. One of the most
important is the comparison of the 70GHz and 100GHz channels. Based on
different instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focal
plane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, and
near the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effect
two different experiments. The 143GHz channel has the lowest noise level on
Planck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. In this
paper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 Planck data. We
concentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143GHz channel maps and power
spectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acoustic
peaks, on maps masked for diffuse Galactic emission and for strong unresolved
sources. Difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin are
consistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave background
structure. Including small but important corrections for unresolved-source
residuals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100GHz power spectra
averaged over 70<l<390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100GHz
power spectra of 0.4% over the same l range. These values are within and
consistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the Planck
2013 results. We also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysis
showing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100/143/217GHz power spectra. We
analyse calibration procedures and beams to determine what fraction of these
differences can be accounted for by known approximations or systematic errors
that could be controlled even better in the future, reducing uncertainties
still further. Several possible small improvements are described...(abridged)

is obtained. The equations for the cosmological scalar perturbations are
analytically solved in order to show that the power spectrum for small $k$
values is $P_{\zeta}\sim 1/k^{\frac{1}{2}+\nu_2}$, where $\nu_2$ depends on the
barotropic index $\gamma_0$. For large $k$ values we find that the power
spectrum is well approximated by the standard inflation model. Additionally,
the three-point correlation function is calculated in order to get the
primordial non-Gaussianity of the perturbation. The result is that $f_{NG}

suggested. The method is based on analysis of gamma-ray emission that is
generated in extragalactic space when ultra-high energy cosmic particles
interact with cosmic background. We have found that intensity of the gamma-ray
emission depends on characteristics of cosmic ray sources, specifically on
their remoteness and initial particle energy spectra. In the Earth atmosphere
cosmic rays initiate air showers, therefore selecting quanta-initiated showers
(and excluding those from the galactic plane, gamma-ray sources, etc.) we can
obtain above mentioned source characteristics. We derive that the number of
quanta-initiated showers is 0 or ~3x1000 depending on source parameters,
typical statistics of showers registered at 10^14 eV being of ~10^8. The
difference is large enough to use this method for studying ultra-high energy
cosmic ray sources.

able to be optimised from data via interactions with real users. However in the

significant time to explore the state-action space to learn to behave in a
desirable manner. This is a critical issue when the system is trained on-line
with real users where learning costs are expensive. Reward shaping is one
promising technique for addressing these concerns. Here we examine three
recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches for providing reward shaping
information in addition to the primary (task-orientated) environmental
feedback. These RNNs are trained on returns from dialogues generated by a
simulated user and attempt to diffuse the overall evaluation of the dialogue
back down to the turn level to guide the agent towards good behaviour faster.
In both simulated and real user scenarios these RNNs are shown to increase
policy learning speed. Importantly, they do not require prior knowledge of the
user's goal.

important for the realization of many quantum-based technologies. In the field
of quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum networking, various
proposals discuss the possibility of hybrid architectures where specific tasks
are delegated to the most suitable subsystem. For example, in quantum networks,
it may be advantageous to transfer information from a subsystem that has good
memory properties to another subsystem that is more efficient at transporting
information between nodes in the network. For trapped-ions, a hybrid system
formed of different species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be
exploited to expand and refine the control of the system. Ions of different
elements have previously been used in QIP experiments for sympathetic cooling,
creation of entanglement through dissipation, and quantum non-demolition (QND)
measurement of one species with another. Here, we demonstrate an entangling
quantum gate between ions of different elements which can serve as an important
building block of QIP, quantum networking, precision spectroscopy, metrology,
and quantum simulation. A geometric phase gate between a $^9$Be$^+$ ion and a
$^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion is realized through an effective spin-spin interaction
generated by state-dependent forces induced with laser beams. Combined with
single-qubit gates and same-species entangling gates, this mixed-element
entangling gate provides a complete set of gates over such a hybrid system for
universal QIP. Using a sequence of such gates, we demonstrate a Controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate and a SWAP gate. We further demonstrate the robustness of these
gates against thermal excitation and show improved detection in quantum logic
spectroscopy (QLS). We also observe a strong violation of a CHSH-type Bell

Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using Back Propagation (i.e., BP-sLDA), which
maximizes the posterior probability of the prediction variable given the input

approaches, the proposed learning method applies (i) the mirror descent
algorithm for maximum a posterior inference and (ii) back propagation over a
deep architecture together with stochastic gradient/mirror descent for model
parameter estimation, leading to scalable and end-to-end discriminative
learning of the model. As a byproduct, we also apply this technique to develop
a new learning method for the traditional unsupervised LDA model (i.e.,
BP-LDA). Experimental results on three real-world regression and classification
tasks show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the previous
supervised topic models, neural networks, and is on par with deep neural
networks.

  Processing",,"10.1109/TSP.2015.2472362",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a compressive sensing (CS) approach is proposed for sparse
binary signals' compression and reconstruction based on analog fountain codes
(AFCs). In the proposed scheme, referred to as the analog fountain compressive
sensing (AFCS), each measurement is generated from a linear combination of L
randomly selected binary signal elements with real weight coefficients. The
weight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called
measurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution
function. We propose a simple verification based reconstruction algorithm for
the AFCS in the noiseless case. The proposed verification based decoder is
analyzed through SUM-OR tree analytical approach and an optimization problem is
formulated to find the optimum measurement degree to minimize the number of
measurements required for the reconstruction of binary sparse signals. We show
that in the AFCS, the number of required measurements is of O(-n log(1-k/n)),
where n is the signal length and k is the signal sparsity level. We then
consider the signal reconstruction of AFCS in the presence of additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the standard message passing decoder is then used for
the signal recovery. Simulation results show that the AFCS can perfectly
recover all non-zero elements of the sparse binary signal with a significantly
reduced number of measurements, compared to the conventional binary CS and
L1-minimization approaches in a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNRs).
Finally, we show a practical application of the AFCS for the sparse event
detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where the sensors' readings can
be treated as measurements from the CS point of view.

are capable of accounting for the observed flat extinction at ~ 3-8 micron and
produce no excessive emission in the far-IR. These grains could be present in
the diffuse ISM through rapid exchange of material between dense molecular

This spiral wave chimera rotates inwardly, i.e., coherent waves propagate

order of their desired departure times. We model this scenario as a
non-cooperative game in which each user selects his actual arrival time. We
present explicit equilibria solutions for a two-user example, namely the
subgame perfect and Nash equilibria and show that multiple equilibria may
exist. We further explain why a general solution for any number of users is
computationally challenging. The difficulty lies in the fact that the objective
functions are piecewise convex, i.e., non-smooth and non-convex. As a result,
the minimization of the costs relies on checking all arrival and departure
order permutations, which is exponentially large with respect to the population
size. Instead we propose an iterated best-response algorithm which can be
efficiently studied numerically. Finally, we compare the equilibrium arrival
profiles to a socially optimal solution and discuss the implications.

epitaxially grown on LaAlO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ single crystal substrates,
respectively, within the spectral range of 0.6 and 6.5 eV are reported.
Strain-driven anisotropy changes and transition shifts are observed as well as
evidence of sub-band gap many-particle excitations are found. The transition
shifts, mostly to higher energies for the highly strained tetragonal-like
BiFeO$_3$ phase on LaAlO$_3$, are indicative of band structure differences.
Additionally, optical modelling, confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy
studies, revealed that the average polarization direction of bivariant
BiFeO$_3$ on LaAlO$_3$ is not parallel to the crystallographic [001] direction
but tilted by about $7^{\circ}$. Spectral weight analyses reveal
phase-dependent differences underlining that theoretical calculations of
optical spectra need further improvement to appropriately account for
electronic and excitonic correlations to fully understand multiferroic

The proposed approach is applicable to both binary and multi-class problems
without any modification. Moreover, as opposed to data level approaches, we do
not alter the original data distribution which results in a lower computational
cost during the training process. We report the results of our experiments on
six major image classification datasets and show that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms. Comparisons with popular

right equilibrium between elasticity and viscosity, referred to as
viscoelasticity. Manifestations of that can be found in everyday live, where
the viscoelasticity in a tire needs to be balanced so it is still flexible and
can dissipate shock-energy, yet hard enough for energy-saving operation.
Similarly, the cartilage in joints needs to absorb shocks while operating at
low- level friction with high elasticity. Two such examples with a biological
applicability are stiff membranes, which allow for the sliding of joints and
therefore maintain their function over the lifetime of the corresponding
individual (decades) and the softening of cell membranes, for example for
antimicrobial effects by dissolution in the case of bacteria (seconds). While
the first should allow for low- friction operation at high elasticity, in the
second scenario energy dissipated into the membrane eventually leads to
membrane destruction. Here we address the intrinsic difference between these
two types of membranes, differing in stiffness and displaying different
relaxation behavior on the nanosecond time scale. The harder membranes show
additional elastic modes, capillary waves, that indicate the high degree of
elasticity necessary for instance in cartilage or red blood cells. The energy
of these modes is in the order of 1 micro-eV. As model systems we chose a hard
phospholipidmembrane of SoyPC lipids and a D2O/C10E4/decane microemulsion
system representing soft surfactant membranes. Our results help to explain
properties observed for many membranes in nature, where hard membranes
lubricate joints or stay intact as red blood particles in tiniest capillaries,
both with extremely long lifetimes. Contrarily, softened membranes can be
destroyed easily under little shear stress within seconds.

strips in the form of a square spiral which contain bends with the very same
curvature with respect to the directions of bias current and external magnetic
field, we have shown that dark counts as well as light counts at small photon
energies originate from areas around the bends. The minimum in the rate of dark
counts reproduces the asymmetry of the maximum critical current density as
function of the magnetic field. Contrary, the minimum in the rate of light
counts demonstrate opposite asymmetry. The rate of light counts become
symmetric at large currents and fields. Comparing locally computed absorption
probabilities for photons and the simulated threshold detection current we
found the approximate locations of areas near bends which deliver asymmetric
light counts. Any asymmetry is absent in Archimedean spiral structures without
bends.

carried out for both ideal and resistive limits, namely the propagation of
Alfv\'en waves in the ideal MHD and the evolution of current sheets in the
resistive regime, where very good agreement is observed comparing to the
analytical results. Additionally, two-dimensional magnetic reconnection driven
by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is studied and the effects of different
parameters on the reconnection rate are investigated. It is shown that the
density ratio has negligible effect on the magnetic reconnection rate, while an
increase in shear velocity decreases the reconnection rate. Additionally, it is
found that the reconnection rate is proportional to $\sigma^{-\frac{1}{2}}$,
$\sigma$ being the conductivity, which is in agreement with the scaling law of
the Sweet-Parker model. Finally, the numerical model is used to study the
magnetic reconnection in a stellar flare. Three-dimensional simulation suggests
that the reconnection between the background and flux rope magnetic lines in a

the system admits a bistable solution and the external field governs the rate

second order transition that, in the case of reactive systems, takes the form
of a transcritical bifurcation at the crossing point. We solve for the front
shape and its response to external white noise, showing that static properties

statistics. These take a Gaussian form in the bifurcation case and a
double-peak shape in a bistable system. The results of a recent analysis of the

us call a stochastic game $\epsilon$-ergodic, if its values from any two

outputs for every $\epsilon>0$ in finite time either a pair of stationary
strategies for the two players guaranteeing that the values from any initial

$\epsilon$-ergodic, then there are stationary strategies for the players
proving $24\epsilon$-ergodicity. This result strengthens and provides a
constructive version of an existential result by Vrieze (1980) claiming that if
a stochastic game is $0$-ergodic, then there are $\epsilon$-optimal stationary
strategies for every $\epsilon > 0$. The suggested algorithm is based on a

But the presence of a plasma drift velocity in the corotating frame of
reference does provide a mechanism whereby the net charge of the star can be

DM halo with present and future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT)
are investigated. The source count distribution and angular power spectra for
\gamma-rays originating from annihilating DM in subhalos are calculated from
N-body simulation results. To study the systematic uncertainties coming from
the modeling of the DM density distribution, parameters describing the
\gamma-ray yield from subhalos are varied in 16 benchmark models. We conclude
that Galactic subhalos of annihilating DM are probably too faint to be a
promising target for IACT observations, even with the prospective Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA).

the low-frequency part of the SKA will provide very precise measurements of
individual cosmic ray air showers. These precision measurements will allow
detailed studies of the mass composition of cosmic rays in the energy region of
transition from a Galactic to an extragalactic origin. Also, the SKA will
facilitate three-dimensional ""tomography"" of the electromagnetic cascades of
air showers, allowing the study of particle interactions at energies beyond the

constituent two orthogonal circular polarization modes of an input linearly
polarized light evolve in different trajectories, eventually manifesting as a
large and tunable spin separation. The spin specificity of the beam shift and
the demonstrated principle of simultaneously tailoring space-varying geometric

  sequential event based approach",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While a drop of liquid is placed on another liquid surface, two possible
coalescence outcomes are observed. The parent drop bounces several times,
floats and then disappears within the liquid pool without producing daughter
droplets. This is called complete coalescence. Another outcome is the
generation of secondary droplets from the primary drop itself. This is called
partial coalescence. Repetitions of such phenomenon as a successive
self-similar event is also known as coalescence cascade. In a nutshell,
complete coalescence is governed strongly by swallowing mechanism whereas
partial coalescence is attributed to slippage mechanism and solutal Marangoni
flow. Here we use high speed camera and witness that water drop coalesces
completely after impacting on pool of liquid whereas drop of non-ionic
surfactant (TWEEN 20) coalesces partially. We also observe that number of
daughter droplet generation is a strong function of surfactant concentration.
Here we utilise the images to elaborately explain both the phenomenon in a
sequential event based approach using the basic understanding of physics. We
observe the transient evolution of drop morphology during each stage and find
shape wise resemblances with many common objects. Our study reveals some
interesting insight on the intermediate mechanisms and enlightens distinctive
features of both the phenomena. Here we propose for the first time that
additional instability due to slippage of rising water layer from the
surfactant drop and upward thrust due to Laplace pressure helps in formation of
secondary droplet. Keywords: Partial coalescence, complete coalescence, high
speed camera, drop morphology, slippage, Laplace pressure.

of the amplitude measured by LOPES we used an external source. Previous
comparisons of LOPES measurements and simulations of the radio signal amplitude
predicted by CoREAS revealed a discrepancy of the order of a factor of two. A
re-measurement of the reference calibration source, now performed for the free

values lead to a lowering of the reconstructed electric field measured by LOPES
by a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.2$ and therefore to a significantly better agreement
with CoREAS simulations. We discuss the updated calibration and its impact on

results in a well-known mismatch between theoretical solar models and

center-to-limb variation of the OI IR triplet lines at 777 nm in different sets
of spectra with the help of detailed synthetic line profiles based on 3D
hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmospheres and 3D non-LTE line formation
calculations with NLTETD. The idea is to simultaneously derive the oxygen
abundance,A(O), and the scaling factor SH that describes the cross-sections for
inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen relative the classical Drawin
formula. The best fit of the center-to-limb variation of the triplet lines
achieved with the CO5BOLD 3D solar model is clearly of superior quality
compared to the line profile fits obtained with standard 1D model atmospheres.
Our best estimate of the 3D non-LTE solar oxygen abundance is A(O) = 8.76 +/-
0.02, with the scaling factor SH in the range between 1.2 and 1.8. All 1D
non-LTE models give much lower oxygen abundances, by up to -0.15 dex. This is
mainly a consequence of the assumption of a $\mu$-independent microturbulence.

logical inference, a procedure where conclusions are reached on the basis of
incomplete information. But such a framework can be more compelling if it is
underpinned by dynamical arguments, and we show how this can be provided by
stochastic thermodynamics, where an explicit link is made between the
production of entropy and the stochastic dynamics of a system coupled to an
environment. The separation of entropy production into three components allows
us to select a stationary state by maximising the change, averaged over all
realisations of the motion, in the principal relaxational or nonadiabatic
component, equivalent to requiring that this contribution to the entropy
production should become time independent for all realisations. We show that
this recovers the usual equilibrium probability density function (pdf) for a
conservative system in an isothermal environment, as well as the stationary
nonequilibrium pdf for a particle confined to a potential under nonisothermal
conditions, and a particle subject to a constant nonconservative force under
isothermal conditions. The two remaining components of entropy production
account for a recently discussed thermodynamic anomaly between over- and
underdamped treatments of the dynamics in the nonisothermal stationary state.

maximally non-local theories whose state spaces are reducible into two or more

the near horizon region of the extremal black holes. These geometries have
$SL(2,\mathbb{R})\!\times\!U(1)^n$ isometry, and constitute a family of
solutions to the theory under consideration. In the first part of this report,
their thermodynamic properties are reviewed, and their three universal laws are
derived. In addition, at the end of the first part, the role of these laws in
black hole thermodynamics is presented.
  In the second part of this thesis, we review building their classical phase
space in the Einstein-Hilbert theory. The elements in the NHEG phase space
manifold are built by appropriately chosen coordinate transformations of the
original metric. These coordinate transformations are generated by some vector
fields, dubbed ""symplectic symmetry generators."" To fully specify the phase
space, we also need to identify the symplectic structure. In order to fix the
symplectic structure, we use the formulation of Covariant Phase Space method.
The symplectic structure has two parts, the Lee-Wald term and a boundary
contribution. The latter is fixed requiring on-shell vanishing of the
symplectic current, which guarantees the conservation and integrability of the
symplectic structure, and leads to the new concept of ""symplectic symmetry.""
Given the symplectic structure, we construct the corresponding conserved
charges, the ""symplectic symmetry generators."" We also specify the explicit
expression of the charges as a functional over the phase space. These symmetry
generators constitute the ""NHEG algebra,"" which is an infinite dimensional
algebra (may be viewed as a generalized Virasoro), and admits a central
extension which is equal to the black hole entropy.

compound of WTe2, MoTe2, which is also predicted to be a WSM and a quantum spin
Hall insulator in bulk and monolayer form, respectively. We find that MoTe2

The application of a small pressure (such as 0.4 GPa) is shown to dramatically
enhance the Tc, with a maximum value of 8.2 K being obtained at 11.7 GPa (a
more than 80-fold increase in Tc). This yields a dome-shaped superconducting
phase diagram. Further explorations into the nature of the superconductivity in

where each node has one out of two initial opinions. In every round, every node
adopts the majority opinion among its neighbors. By using a potential argument
first discovered by Goles and Olivos (1980), it is known that this process
always converges in $O(|E|)$ rounds to a two-periodic state in which every node
either keeps its opinion or changes it in every round.
  It has been shown by Frischknecht, Keller, and Wattenhofer (2013) that the
$O(|E|)$ bound on the convergence time of the deterministic binary majority
process is indeed tight even for dense graphs. However, in many graphs such as
the complete graph, from any initial opinion assignment, the process converges
in just a constant number of rounds.
  By carefully exploiting the structure of the potential function by Goles and
Olivos (1980), we derive a new upper bound on the convergence time of the
deterministic binary majority process that accounts for such exceptional cases.
We show that it is possible to identify certain modules of a graph $G$ in order
to obtain a new graph $G^\Delta$ with the property that the worst-case
convergence time of $G^\Delta$ is an upper bound on that of $G$. Moreover, even
though our upper bound can be computed in linear time, we show that, given an
integer $k$, it is NP-hard to decide whether there exists an initial opinion
assignment for which it takes more than $k$ rounds to converge to the
two-periodic state.

transitions separated by a tricritical point. More recently, it has been
claimed that Nagle's model provides an example of the inequivalence between
canonical and microcanonical calculations. We then revisit Nagle's original
solution, as well as the usual formulation of the problem in a canonical
ensemble, which lead to the same results. Also, in contrast to recent claims,
we show that an alternative formulation in the microcanonical ensemble, with
the adequate choice of the fixed thermodynamic extensive variables, leads to
equivalent thermodynamic results.

simple estimates for the production cross section of pairs of the EWSBS bosons

examine the simplest production mechanisms, tree-level production through a $W$
(dominant when quantum numbers allow) and the simple effective boson
approximation (in which the electroweak bosons are considered as collinear
partons of the colliding fermions). We exemplify with custodial isovector and
isotensor resonances at 2 TeV, the energy currently being discussed because of
a slight excess in the ATLAS 2-jet data. We find it hard, though not
unthinkable, to ascribe this excess to one of these $W_LW_L$ rescattering
resonances. An isovector resonance could be produced at a rate smaller than,
but close to earlier CMS exclusion bounds, depending on the parameters of the
effective theory. The $ZZ$ excess is then problematic and requires additional
physics (such as an additional scalar resonance). The isotensor one (that would
describe all charge combinations) has a smaller cross section.

accumulation of stress over time, interrupted by sudden energy releases called
avalanches. Recently, it has been pointed out that several basic features of
avalanche dynamics are induced at the microscopic level by relaxation
processes, which are neglected by most models. During my thesis, I studied two
well-known models of avalanche dynamics, modified minimally by the inclusion of
some forms of relaxation.
  The first system is that of a viscoelastic interface driven in a disordered
medium. In mean-field, we prove that the interface has a periodic behaviour
(with a new, emerging time scale), with avalanche events that span the whole
system. We compute semi-analytically the friction force acting on this surface,
and find that it is compatible with classical friction experiments. In finite
dimensions (2D), the mean-field system-sized events become local, and numerical
simulations give qualitative and quantitative results in good agreement with
several important features of real earthquakes.
  The second system including a minimal form of relaxation consists in a toy
model of avalanches: the Directed Percolation process. In our study of a
non-Markovian variant of Directed Percolation, we observed that the
universality class was modified but not completely. In particular, in the
non-Markov case an exponent changes of value while several scaling relations
still hold. This picture of an extended universality class obtained by the
addition of a non-Markovian perturbation to the dynamics provides promising
prospects for our first system.

describing the thermodynamic limit of the underlying statistical mechanics of
microscopic degrees of freedom of the spacetime. The connection is established
by attributing a heat density Ts to the null surfaces where T is the
appropriate Davies-Unruh temperature and s is the entropy density. The field
equations can be obtained from a thermodynamic variational principle which
extremizes the total heat density of all null surfaces. The explicit form of s
determines the nature of the theory. We explore the consequences of this
paradigm for an arbitrary null surface and highlight the thermodynamic
significance of various geometrical quantities. In particular, we show that:
(a) A conserved current, associated with the time development vector in a
natural fashion, has direct thermodynamic interpretation in all
Lanczos-Lovelock models of gravity. (b) One can generalize the notion of
gravitational momentum, introduced in arXiv 1506.03814 to all Lanczos-Lovelock
models of gravity such that the conservation of the total momentum leads to the
relevant field equations. (c) The thermodynamic variational principle which
leads to the field equations of gravity can also be expressed in terms of the
gravitational momentum in all Lanczos-Lovelock models. (d) Three different
projections of gravitational momentum related to an arbitrary null surface in
the spacetime lead to three different equations, all of which have
thermodynamic interpretation. The first one reduces to a Navier-Stokes equation
for the transverse drift velocity. The second can be written as a thermodynamic
identity TdS = dE + P dV. The third describes the time evolution of the null
surface in terms of suitably defined surface and bulk degrees of freedom. The
implications are discussed.
