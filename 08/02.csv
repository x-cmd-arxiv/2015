in microfluidic T-junctions are investigated using numerical simulations of
dilute polymer solutions at changing the Capillary number ($\mbox {Ca}$), i.e.
at changing the balance between the viscous forces and the surface tension at
the interface, up to $\mbox{Ca} \approx 3 \times 10^{-2}$. A Navier-Stokes (NS)
description of the solvent based on the lattice Boltzmann models (LBM) is here
coupled to constitutive equations for finite extensible non-linear elastic
dumbbells with the closure proposed by Peterlin (FENE-P model). We present the
results of three-dimensional simulations in a range of $\mbox{Ca}$ which is
broad enough to characterize all the three characteristic mechanisms of breakup
in the confined T-junction, i.e. ${\it squeezing}$, ${\it dripping}$ and ${\it
jetting}$ regimes. The various model parameters of the FENE-P constitutive
equations, including the polymer relaxation time $\tau_P$ and the finite
extensibility parameter $L^2$, are changed to provide quantitative details on
how the dynamics and break-up properties are affected by viscoelasticity. We
will analyze cases with ${\it Droplet ~Viscoelasticity}$ (DV), where
viscoelastic properties are confined in the dispersed (d) phase, as well as
cases with ${\it Matrix ~Viscoelasticity}$ (MV), where viscoelastic properties
are confined in the continuous (c) phase. Moderate flow-rate ratios $Q \approx
{\cal O}(1)$ of the two phases are considered in the present study. Overall, we
find that the effects are more pronounced in the case with MV, as the flow
driving the break-up process upstream of the emerging thread can be sensibly
perturbed by the polymer stresses.

problems, which is related to contention resolution schemes, a technique
initially introduced in the context of submodular function maximization. Our
rounding technique, which we call online contention resolution schemes (OCRSs),
is applicable to many online selection problems, including Bayesian online
selection, oblivious posted pricing mechanisms, and stochastic probing models.
It allows for handling a wide set of constraints, and shares many strong
properties of offline contention resolution schemes. In particular, OCRSs for
different constraint families can be combined to obtain an OCRS for their
intersection. Moreover, we can approximately maximize submodular functions in
the online settings we consider.
  We, thus, get a broadly applicable framework for several online selection
problems, which improves on previous approaches in terms of the types of
constraints that can be handled, the objective functions that can be dealt
with, and the assumptions on the strength of the adversary. Furthermore, we
resolve two open problems from the literature; namely, we present the first
constant-factor constrained oblivious posted price mechanism for matroid
constraints, and the first constant-factor algorithm for weighted stochastic
probing with deadlines.

are affected by $N - 1$ independent macroscopic phase differences between
superconducting leads and can be regarded as energy bands in $N - 1$ periodic
solid owing to the $2\pi$ periodicity in all phases. We investigate the
singularities and peculiarities of the resulting ABS spectrum combining
phenomenological and analytical methods and illustrating with the numerical
results. We pay special attention on spin-orbit (SO) effects. We consider Weyl
singularities with a conical spectrum that are situated at zero energy in the
absence of SO interaction. We show that the SO interaction splits the spectrum
in spin like a Zeeman field would do. The singularity is preserved while
departed from zero energy. With SO interaction, points of zero-energy form an
$N - 2$ dimensional manifold in $N - 1$ dimensional space of phases, while this
dimension is $N - 3$ in the absence of SO interaction. The singularities of
other type are situated near the superconducting gap edge. In the absence
(presence) of SO interaction, the ABS spectrum at the gap edge is
mathematically analogues to that at zero energy in the presence (absence) of SO
interaction. We demonstrate that the gap edge touching (GET) points of the
spectrum in principle form $N - 2$ ($N - 3$) dimensional manifold when the SO
interaction is absent (present). Certain symmetry lines in the Brillouin zone
of the phases are exceptional from this rule, and GET there should be
considered separately. We derive and study the effective Hamiltonians for all

laser-induced optical lattice recently emerged as a new tool for the study of
friction between ideal crystal surfaces. Here we focus in particular on static
friction, the minimal sliding force necessary to depin one lattice from the
other. If the colloid and the optical lattices are mutually commensurate, the
colloid sliding is always pinned by static friction; but when they are
incommensurate the presence or absence of pinning can be expected to depend
upon the system parameters. If a 2D analogy to the mathematically established
Aubry transition of one-dimensional systems were to hold, an increasing
periodic corrugation strength $U_0$ should turn an initially free-sliding
monolayer into a pinned state through a well-defined dynamical phase
transition. We address this problem by the simulated sliding of a realistic
model 2D colloidal lattice, confirming the existence of a clear and sharp
superlubric-pinned transition for increasing corrugation strength. Unlike the
1D Aubry transition which is continuous, the 2D transition exhibits a definite
first-order character. With no change of symmetry, the transition entails a
structural character, with a sudden increase of the colloid-colloid interaction
energy, accompanied by a compensating downward jump of the colloid-corrugation
energy. The transition value for the corrugation amplitude $U_0$ depends upon
the misalignment angle $\theta$ between the optical and the colloidal lattices,
superlubricity surviving until larger corrugations for angles away from the
energetically favored orientation, which is itself generally slightly
misaligned, as shown in recent work. The observability of the
superlubric-pinned colloid transition is proposed and discussed.

domains of cross-disciplinary interest. Reaction-diffusion systems hosted on
directed graphs are in particular relevant for their widespread applications,
from neuroscience, to computer networks and traffic systems. Due to the
peculiar spectrum of the discrete Laplacian operator, homogeneous fixed points
can turn unstable, on a directed support, because of the topology of the
network, a phenomenon which cannot be induced on undirected graphs. A linear
analysis can be performed to single out the conditions that underly the
instability. The complete characterization of the patterns, which are
eventually attained beyond the linear regime of exponential growth, calls
instead for a full non linear treatment. By performing a multiple time scale
perturbative calculation, we here derive an effective equation for the non
linear evolution of the amplitude of the most unstable mode, close to the
threshold of criticality. This is a Stuart-Landau equation whose complex
coefficients appear to depend on the topological features of the embedding
directed graph. The theory proves adequate versus simulations, as confirmed by
operating with a paradigmatic reaction-diffusion model.

about the world. Combinatorial codes, comprised of binary patterns of neural
activity, encode information via the collective behavior of populations of
neurons. A code is called convex if its codewords correspond to regions defined
by an arrangement of convex open sets in Euclidean space. Convex codes have
been observed experimentally in many brain areas, including sensory cortices
and the hippocampus, where neurons exhibit convex receptive fields. What makes
a neural code convex? That is, how can we tell from the intrinsic structure of
a code if there exists a corresponding arrangement of convex open sets? In this
work, we provide a complete characterization of local obstructions to
convexity. This motivates us to define max intersection-complete codes, a
family guaranteed to have no local obstructions. We then show how our
characterization enables one to use free resolutions of Stanley-Reisner ideals
in order to detect violations of convexity. Taken together, these results
provide a significant advance in understanding the intrinsic combinatorial
properties of convex codes.

computing the correlations of gauge-fixed Polyakov lines with color-twisted
boundary conditions in the time direction. The values of the lowest energies in
the color singlet and octet external source sectors agree within statistical
errors, confirming that both channels contribute to the lowest (global singlet)
state of the Feynman kernel. We then study the case of homogeneous boundary
conditions in the time direction for which the gauge-fixing is not needed. In
this case the lowest energies extracted in the singlet external source sector
agree with those determined with periodic boundary conditions, while in the

cortical circuits dynamics evolve through temporal sequences of metastable
states. Metastability has been studied for its potential role in sensory
coding, memory and decision-making. Yet, very little is known about the network
mechanisms responsible for its genesis. It is often assumed that the onset of
state sequences is triggered by an external stimulus. Here we show that state
sequences can be observed also in the absence of overt sensory stimulation.
Analysis of multielectrode recordings from the gustatory cortex of alert rats
revealed ongoing sequences of states, where single neurons spontaneously attain
several firing rates across different states. This single neuron
multi-stability represents a challenge to existing spiking network models,
where typically each neuron is at most bi-stable. We present a recurrent
spiking network model that accounts for both the spontaneous generation of
state sequences and the multi-stability in single neuron firing rates. Each
state results from the activation of neural clusters with potentiated
intra-cluster connections, with the firing rate in each cluster depending on
the number of active clusters. Simulations show that the models ensemble
activity hops among the different states, reproducing the ongoing dynamics
observed in the data. When probed with external stimuli, the model predicts the
quenching of single neuron multi-stability into bi-stability and the reduction
of trial-by-trial variability. Both predictions were confirmed in the data.
Altogether, these results provide a theoretical framework that captures both
ongoing and evoked network dynamics in a single mechanistic model.

spent by each user to transmit a bit pool with some given size. In this paper,
the information-theoretic formulation of completion time is based on the
concept of constrained rates, where users are allowed to employ different
numbers of channel uses for transmission as opposed to the equal channel use of
the standard information-theoretic formulation. Analogous to the capacity
region, the completion time region characterizes all possible trade-offs among
users' completion times. For a multi-access channel, it is shown that the
completion time region is achieved by operating the channel in two independent
phases: a multi-access phase when both users are transmitting, and a
point-to-point phase when one user has finished and the other is still
transmitting. Using a similar two-phase approach, the completion time region
(or inner and outer bounds) is established for a Gaussian broadcast channel and
a Gaussian interference channel. It is observed that although consisting of two
convex subregions, the completion time region may not be convex in general.
Finally an optimization problem of minimizing the weighted sum completion time
for a Gaussian multi-access channel and a Gaussian broadcast channel is solved,
demonstrating the utility of the completion time approach.

investigated, where one of the two broadcast receivers is subject to
interference coming from a point-to-point transmission. For a general discrete

on message splitting, superposition and binning is proposed and a concise
representation of the corresponding achievable rate region R is obtained. Two
partial-order broadcast conditions interference-oblivious less noisy and
interference-cognizant less noisy are defined, thereby extending the usual less
noisy condition for a regular broadcast channel by taking interference into
account. Under these conditions, a reduced form of R is shown to be equivalent
to a rate region based on a simpler scheme, where the broadcast transmitter
uses only superposition. Furthermore, if interference is strong for the
interference-oblivious less noisy DM-BIC, the capacity region is given by the
aforementioned two equivalent rate regions. For a Gaussian broadcast
interference channel (GBIC), channel parameters are categorized into three
regimes. For the first two regimes, which are closely related to the two
partial-order broadcast conditions, achievable rate regions are derived by
specializing the corresponding achievable schemes of DM-BICs with Gaussian
input distributions. The entropy power inequality (EPI) based outer bounds are
obtained by combining bounding techniques for a Gaussian broadcast channel
(GBC) and a Gaussian interference channel (GIC). These inner and outer bounds
lead to either exact or approximate characterizations of capacity regions and

behaviors and the interactions with socioeconomic and natural environment. With
the continuing advancement of location and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based
social media (LBSM) have been gaining widespread popularity in the past few
years. With an access to locations of users, profiles and the contents of the
social media posts, the LBSM data provided a novel modality of data source for
human mobility study. By exploiting the explicit location footprints and mining
the latent demographic information implied in the LBSM data, the purpose of
this paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of human
mobility with a particular focus on the impact of demography. We first collect
geo-tagged Twitter feeds posted in the conterminous United States area, and
organize the collection of feeds using the concept of space-time trajectory
corresponding to each Twitter user. Commonly human mobility measures, including
detected home and activity centers, are derived for each user trajectory. We
then select a subset of Twitter users that have detected home locations in the
city of Chicago as a case study, and apply name analysis to the names provided
in user profiles to learn the implicit demographic information of Twitter
users, including race/ethnicity, gender and age. Finally we explore the
spatiotemporal distribution and mobility characteristics of Chicago Twitter
users, and investigate the demographic impact by comparing the differences
across three demographic dimensions (race/ethnicity, gender and age). We found
that, although the human mobility measures of different demographic groups
generally follow the generic laws (e.g., power law distribution), the
demographic information, particular the race/ethnicity group, significantly
affects the urban human mobility patterns.

direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and block coordinate descent (BCD) for
nonseparable minimization models with quadratic coupling terms. The novel
convergence results presented in this paper answer several open questions that
have been the subject of considerable discussion. We firstly extend the 2-block
proximal ADMM to linearly constrained convex optimization with a coupled
quadratic objective function, an area where theoretical understanding is
currently lacking, and prove that the sequence generated by the proximal ADMM
converges in point-wise manner to a primal-dual solution pair. Moreover, we
apply randomly permuted ADMM (RPADMM) to nonseparable multi-block convex
optimization, and prove its expected convergence for a class of nonseparable
quadratic programming problems. When the linear constraint vanishes, the
2-block proximal ADMM and RPADMM reduce to the 2-block cyclic proximal BCD
method and randomly permuted BCD (RPBCD). Our study provides the first iterate
convergence result for 2-block cyclic proximal BCD without assuming the
boundedness of the iterates. We also theoretically establish the expected
iterate convergence result concerning multi-block RPBCD for convex quadratic
optimization. In addition, we demonstrate that RPBCD may have a worse
convergence rate than cyclic proximal BCD for 2-block convex quadratic
minimization problems. Although the results on RPADMM and RPBCD are restricted
to quadratic minimization models, they provide some interesting insights: 1)
random permutation makes ADMM and BCD more robust for multi-block convex
minimization problems; 2) cyclic BCD may outperform RPBCD for ""nice"" problems,
and therefore RPBCD should be applied with caution when solving general convex
optimization problems.

memory devices. Recently, a novel type of antisymmetric exchange interaction,
namely the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), has been uncovered and
found to influence the formation of topological defects. Exploring how the DMI
affects the dynamics of topological defects is therefore an important task.
Here we investigate the dynamic domain wall (DW) under a strong DMI and find
that the DMI induces an annihilation of topological vertical Bloch lines (VBLs)
by lifting the four-fold degeneracy of the VBL. As a result, velocity reduction
originating from the Walker breakdown is completely suppressed, leading to a
soliton-like constant velocity of the DW. Furthermore, the strength of the DMI,
which is the key factor for soliton-like DW motion, can be quantified without
any side effects possibly arising from current-induced torques or extrinsic
pinnings in magnetic films. Our results therefore shed light on the physics of
dynamic topological defects, which paves the way for future work in
topology-based memory applications.

have been attracting increasing attention due to their simplicity, scalability,
and effectiveness. However, comparing to sophisticated deep learning
architectures such as convolutional neural networks, these methods usually
yield inferior results when applied to particular machine learning tasks. One
possible reason is that these text embedding methods learn the representation
of text in a fully unsupervised way, without leveraging the labeled information
available for the task. Although the low dimensional representations learned
are applicable to many different tasks, they are not particularly tuned for any
task. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a semi-supervised
representation learning method for text data, which we call the
\textit{predictive text embedding} (PTE). Predictive text embedding utilizes
both labeled and unlabeled data to learn the embedding of text. The labeled
information and different levels of word co-occurrence information are first
represented as a large-scale heterogeneous text network, which is then embedded
into a low dimensional space through a principled and efficient algorithm. This
low dimensional embedding not only preserves the semantic closeness of words
and documents, but also has a strong predictive power for the particular task.
Compared to recent supervised approaches based on convolutional neural
networks, predictive text embedding is comparable or more effective, much more
efficient, and has fewer parameters to tune.

resolution achieved to date. The observations, obtained with the first station
of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1), show unprecedented detail of solar
emissions across a wide bandwidth during a Type III/IIIb storm. Our flux
calibration demonstrates that the LWA1 can detect Type III bursts much weaker
than 1 SFU, much lower than previous observations, and that the distribution of
fluxes in these bursts varies with frequency. The high sensitivity and low
noise in the data provide strong constraints to models of this type of plasma
emission. The continuous generation of electron beams in the corona revealed by
the high density Type III storm is evidence for ubiquitous magnetic
reconnection in the lower corona. Such an abundance of reconnection events not
only contributes to the total coronal energy budget, but also provides an
engine by which to form the populations of seed particles responsible for
proton-rich solar energetic particle events. An active region with such levels
of reconnection and the accompanying type III/IIIb storms is here proposed to
be associated with an increase of SEP production if a CME erupts. The data's
constraints on existing theories of type IIIIb production are used to make an
association of the observed type IIIb storm to specific electron beam paths
with increased inhomogeneities in density, temperature, and or turbulence. This
scenario ties in the observed timing of III and IIIb storms, constrained
theories of type III and IIIb emission, and the ability of the emitting AR to
produce a strong SEP event. The result requires but a single observable to
cement these ideas, the statistical correlation of type III/IIIb activity with

set up the necessary tools to understand this correspondence for interesting

decreases both the search time and memory usage. In addition, several

relevant images' co-existing in the same Voronoi cells obtained via the

abundance distributions for this star using full Stokes vector (Stokes $IQUV$)
high-resolution observations obtained with the ESPaDOnS and Narval
spectropolarimeters. Our maps, produced using the Invers10 magnetic Doppler
imaging (MDI) code, show that HD 32633 has a strong magnetic field which
features two large regions of opposite polarity but deviates significantly from
a pure dipole field. We use a spherical harmonic expansion to characterise the
magnetic field and find that the harmonic energy is predominately in the
$\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ poloidal modes with a small toroidal component. At the
same time, we demonstrate that the observed Stokes parameter profiles of HD
32633 cannot be fully described by either a dipolar or dipolar plus quadrupolar
field geometry. We compare the magnetic field topology of HD 32633 with other
early-type stars for which MDI analyses have been performed, supporting a trend
of increasing field complexity with stellar mass. We then compare the magnetic
field topology of HD 32633 with derived chemical abundance maps for the

compilation on body tissues that constitute reference adult male and female. We
formulated the relations among mass, electron, and elemental densities into
polylines to connect representative tissues, for which we took mass-weighted
mean for the tissues in limited density regions. We compared the polyline
functions of mass density with a bi-line for electron density and broken lines
for elemental densities, which were derived from preceding studies. Results:
There was generally high correlation between mass density and the other
densities except of C, N, and O for light spongiosa tissues occupying 1% of
body mass. The polylines fitted to the dominant tissues and were generally
consistent with the bi-line and the broken lines. Conclusions: We have
formulated the invariant relations between mass and electron densities and from
mass to elemental densities for body tissues. The formulation enables Monte
Carlo simulation in treatment planning practice without additional burden with

structure. In the present paper it is observed that the $CR$-structure is
induced by an almost contact metric structure. The main goal of the paper is to
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for normality of this structure in
terms of the curvature of the given contact connection. Illustrating examples
are discussed at the end of the paper.

the end of reheating. The backreaction due to particle production is also
included self-consistently. We find that this particular inflation model
realizes the idea of a warm inflation in which a steady thermal bath is
established by the particle production. In most cases this thermal bath exceeds
the amount of radiation released in the reheating process. In the strong
coupling regime, the transition from the inflationary to the
radiation-dominated phase does not involve either a preheating or reheating
process. In addition, energy density peaks produced near the end of inflation
may lead to the formation of primordial black holes.

additive space-time Gaussian white noise of the form $Y_{xt}=F(Y) + \sigma
W_{xt}.$ Such equations, which transform to linear and nonlinear wave
equations, including Klein-Gordon, Liouville's and the sine-Gordon equation,
are related to what Zimmerman (1972) called a diffusion equation. An explicit
numerical scheme is employed in both deterministic and stochastic examples. The
scheme is checked for accuracy against known exact analytical solutions for
deterministic equations. In the stochastic case with $F=0$, solutions yield
sample paths for the Brownian sheet whose statistics match well exact values.
Generally the boundary conditions are chosen to be initial values $Y(x,0)$ and
boundary values $Y(0,t)$ on the quarter-plane or subsets thereof, which have
been shown to lead to existence and uniqueness of solutions. For the linear
case solutions are compared at various grid sizes and wave-like solutions were
found, with and without noise, for non-zero initial and boundary conditions.
Surprisingly, wave-like structures seemed to emerge with zero initial and
boundary conditions and purely noise source terms with no signal. Equations
considered with nonlinear $F$ included quadratic and cubic together with the
sine-Gordon equation. For the latter, wave-like structures were apparent with
$\sigma \le 0.25$ but they tended to be shattered at larger values of $\sigma$.
Previous work on stochastic sine-Gordon equations is briefly reviewed.

large times, one usually considers that the associated relaxation time $\tau$,
i.e., the inverse of that decay rate, is the longest characteristic time in the
system. However that need not be true, and in particular other times such as
the lifetime of an infinitesimal perturbation can be much longer. In the
present work we demonstrate that this paradoxical property can arise even in
quite simple systems such as a chain of reactions obeying mass action kinetics.
By mathematical analysis of simple reaction networks, we pin-point the reason
why the standard relaxation time does not provide relevant information on the
potentially long transient times of typical infinitesimal perturbations.
Overall, we consider four characteristic times and study their behavior in both
simple chains and in more complex reaction networks taken from the publicly
available database ""Biomodels."" In all these systems involving mass action
rates, Michaelis-Menten reversible kinetics, or phenomenological laws for
reaction rates, we find that the characteristic times corresponding to
lifetimes of tracers and of concentration perturbations can be much longer than
$\tau$.
