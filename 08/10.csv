solving non-symmetric rank-deficient linear systems arising in the FFT-based
homogenization of heterogeneous materials defined by digital images. Our
framework is based on the Fourier-Galerkin method with exact and approximate
integrations that has recently been shown to generalize the Lippmann-Schwinger
setting of the original work by Moulinec and Suquet from 1994. It follows from
this variational format that the ensuing system of linear equations can be
solved by general-purpose iterative algorithms for symmetric positive-definite
systems, such as the Richardson, the Conjugate gradient, and the Chebyshev
algorithms, that are compared here to the Eyre-Milton scheme - the most
efficient specialized method currently available. Our numerical experiments,
carried out for two-dimensional elliptic problems, reveal that the Conjugate
gradient algorithm is the most efficient option, while the Eyre-Milton method
performs comparably to the Chebyshev semi-iteration. The Richardson algorithm,
equivalent to the still widely used original Moulinec-Suquet solver, exhibits
the slowest convergence. Besides this, we hope that our study highlights the
potential of the well-established techniques of numerical linear algebra to
further increase the efficiency of FFT-based homogenization methods.

curves in K3 surfaces and the chiral ring of an auxiliary superconformal field
theory. We consider the invariants calculated by Yau--Zaslow (capturing the
Euler characters of the moduli spaces of D2-branes on curves of given genus),
together with their refinements to carry additional quantum numbers by
Katz--Klemm--Vafa (KKV), and Katz--Klemm--Pandharipande (KKP). We show that
these invariants can be reproduced by studying the Ramond ground states of an
auxiliary chiral superconformal field theory which has recently been observed
to give rise to mock modular moonshine for a variety of sporadic simple groups
that are subgroups of Conway's group. We also study equivariant versions of
these invariants. A K3 sigma model is specified by a choice of 4-plane in the
K3 D-brane charge lattice. Symmetries of K3 sigma models are naturally
identified with 4-plane preserving subgroups of the Conway group, according to
the work of Gaberdiel--Hohenegger--Volpato, and one may consider corresponding
equivariant refined K3 Gopakumar--Vafa invariants. The same symmetries
naturally arise in the auxiliary CFT state space, affording a suggestive
alternative view of the same computation. We comment on a lift of this story to
the generating function of elliptic genera of symmetric products of K3
surfaces.

soft and hard X-ray fluxes in the hard spectral state are correlated positively
and negatively, respectively, with the radio flux. We show that this implies
that the observed $\sim$1--100 keV flux (which is a fair approximation to the
bolometric flux) is completely uncorrelated with the radio flux. We can recover
a positive correlation (seen in other sources and expected theoretically) if
the soft X-rays are strongly absorbed by a local medium. Then, however, the
intrinsic X-ray spectrum of Cyg X-3 in its hard state becomes relatively soft,
similar to that of an intermediate spectral state of black-hole binaries, but
not to their true hard state. We also find the radio spectra in the hard state
of Cyg X-3 are hard on average, and the flux distributions of the radio
emission and soft X-rays can be described by sums of two log-normal functions.
We compare Cyg X-3 with other X-ray binaries using colour-colour,
colour-Eddington ratio and Eddington ratio-radio flux diagrams. We find Cyg X-3
to be spectrally most similar to GRS 1915+105, except that Cyg X-3 is
substantially more radio loud, which appears to be due to its jet emission
enhanced by interaction with the powerful stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet
donor.

of the half-space; differently, at $\partial C$, the normal derivative of the

pressure term exerted on the medium at $\partial C$. Under the assumption that
the (pressurized) cavity is small with respect to the distance from the

of the problem. Main ingredients are integral equation formulations of the
harmonic solution of the Neumann problem and a spectral analysis of the
integral operators involved in the problem. In the special case of a datum $g$
which describes a constant pressure at $\partial C$, we recover a simplified
representation based on a polarization tensor.

questions by showing that this $\sigma$-ideal is not homogeneous.
  Let $\mathcal{N}^1_2$ be the $\sigma$-ideal of sets in the plane of
1-dimensional Hausdorff measure zero. D. H. Fremlin determined the position of
the cardinal invariants of this $\sigma$-ideal in the Cicho\'n Diagram. This
required proving numerous inequalities, and in all but three cases it was known
that the inequalities can be strict in certain models. For one of the remaining

showing that consistently $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N}^1_2) >
\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})$, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the usual Lebesgue null
ideal. We also prove that the remaining two inequalities can be strict.
Moreover, we fit the cardinal invariants of the $\sigma$-ideal of sets of
$\sigma$-finite Hausdorff measure into the diagram.
  P. Humke and M. Laczkovich raised the following question. Is it consistent
that there is an ordering of the reals in which all proper initial segments are
Lebesgue null but for every ordering of the reals there is a proper initial
segment that is not null with respect to the $1/2$-dimensional Hausdorff
measure? We determine the values of the cardinal invariants of the Cicho\'n

about the equation of state of supranuclear matter. In the absence of
definitive experimental evidence that determines the correct equation of state,
a number of diverse models that give the pressure in a neutron star as function
of its density have been proposed. These models differ not only in the
approximations and techniques they use to solve the many-body Schr\""odinger
equation, but also in the neutron star composition they assume. We study
whether gravitational wave observations of neutron star binaries in
quasicircular inspirals will allow us to distinguish between equations of state
of differing internal composition, thereby providing important information
about the properties of extremely high density matter. We carry out a Bayesian
model selection analysis, and find that second generation gravitational wave
detectors can heavily constrain equations of state that contain only quark
matter, but hybrid stars containing both normal and quark matter are harder to
distinguish from normal matter stars. A gravitational wave detection with a
signal-to-noise ratio of 30 and masses around $1.4M_{\odot}$ could either
detect or rule out strange quark stars with a 20 to 1 confidence. The presence
of kaon condensates or hyperons in neutron star inner cores cannot be easily
confirmed. For example, for the equations of state studied in this paper, even
a gravitational wave signal with a signal-to-noise ratio as high as 60 would
not allow us to claim a detection of kaon condensates or hyperons with
confidence greater than 5 to 1. On the other hand, if kaon condensates and
hyperons do not form in neutron stars, a gravitational wave signal with similar
signal-to-noise ratio would be able to constrain their existence with an 11 to

nodes of a network have access to different summands of a global objective
function. Nodes cooperate to minimize the global objective by exchanging
information with neighbors only. A decentralized version of the alternating
directions method of multipliers (DADMM) is a common method for solving this
category of problems. DADMM exhibits linear convergence rate to the optimal
objective but its implementation requires solving a convex optimization problem
at each iteration. This can be computationally costly and may result in large
overall convergence times. The decentralized quadratically approximated ADMM
algorithm (DQM), which minimizes a quadratic approximation of the objective
function that DADMM minimizes at each iteration, is proposed here. The
consequent reduction in computational time is shown to have minimal effect on
convergence properties. Convergence still proceeds at a linear rate with a
guaranteed constant that is asymptotically equivalent to the DADMM linear
convergence rate constant. Numerical results demonstrate advantages of DQM
relative to DADMM and other alternatives in a logistic regression problem.

230deg$^2$ of imaging with photometry in 21 bands extending from the far-UV to
the far-IR. These data complement our spectroscopic campaign of over 300k
galaxies, and are compiled from observations with a variety of facilities
including: GALEX, SDSS, VISTA, WISE, and Herschel, with the GAMA regions
currently being surveyed by VST and scheduled for observations by ASKAP. These

derived for 221,373 galaxies with r<19.8 mag. Online tools are provided to
access and download data cutouts, or the full mosaics of the GAMA regions in
each band.
  We focus, in particular, on the reduction and analysis of the VISTA VIKING
data, and compare to earlier datasets (i.e., 2MASS and UKIDSS) before combining
the data and examining its integrity. Having derived the 21-band photometric
catalogue we proceed to fit the data using the energy balance code MAGPHYS.
These measurements are then used to obtain the first fully empirical

Cosmic Spectral Energy Distribution (CSED) across three time-intervals
(0.3-1.1Gyr, 1.1-1.8~Gyr and 1.8---2.4~Gyr), we find that the Universe is

from $(2.5 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{35}$ h$_{70}$ W Mpc$^{-3}$ 2.3~Gyr ago. More
importantly, we identify significant and smooth evolution in the integrated
photon escape fraction at all wavelengths, with the UV escape fraction
increasing from 27(18)% at z=0.18 in NUV(FUV) to 34(23)% at z=0.06.

the non-convexity of the cooperative beamforming design, the underlying

studied using a generalized Grand-canonical Monte-Carlo simulation for a system
of two salts. The effect of the divalent counterion size on the condensation
behavior of the DNA bundle is investigated. Experimentally, it is known that
multivalent counterions have strong effect on the DNA condensation phenomenon.
While tri- and tetra-valent counterions are shown to easily condense free DNA
molecules in solution into toroidal bundles, the situation with divalent
counterions are not as clear cut. Some divalent counterions like Mg$^{+2}$ are
not able to condense free DNA molecules in solution, while some like Mn$^{+2}$
can condense them into disorder bundles. In restricted environment such as in
two dimensional system or inside viral capsid, Mg$^{+2}$ can have strong effect
and able to condense them, but the condensation varies qualitatively with
different system, different coions. It has been suggested that divalent
counterions can induce attraction between DNA molecules but the strength of the
attraction is not strong enough to condense free DNA in solution. However, if
the configuration entropy of DNA is restricted, these attractions are enough to
cause appreciable effects. The variations among different divalent salts might
be due to the hydration effect of the divalent counterions. In this paper, we
try to understand this variation using a very simple parameter, the size of the
divalent counterions. We investigate how divalent counterions with different
sizes can leads to varying qualitative behavior of DNA condensation in
restricted environments. Additionally a Grand canonical Monte-Carlo method for
simulation of systems with two different salts is presented in detail.

states be compared? This deceptively simple question has important consequences
for ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo
dramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of
these shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states.
Unfortunately, the concept of stability in ecology has suffered from
substantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where
stochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable
states. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a
ball-in-cup diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the
position of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push
the ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by
a potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. However,
systems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite
rare. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other
approaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear
stability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and,
as we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will
behave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how
the potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly,
employing a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using
three classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential
provides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems.

such as the Hanle effect, but these approaches become less effective as the
spin lifetime in the semiconductor decreases. For this reason, no electrical
Hanle measurement has been demonstrated in GaAs at room temperature. We show
here that by forcing the magnetization in the ferromagnet (the spin injector
and detector) to precess at the ferromagnetic resonance frequency, an
electrically generated spin accumulation can be detected from 30 to 300 K. At
low temperatures, the distinct Larmor precession of the spin accumulation in
the semiconductor can be detected by ferromagnetic resonance in an oblique
field. We verify the effectiveness of this new spin detection technique by
comparing the injection bias and temperature dependence of the measured spin
signal to the results obtained using traditional methods. We further show that
this new approach enables a measurement of short spin lifetimes (< 100 psec), a
regime that is not accessible in semiconductors using traditional Hanle

not rely on the conventional assumption such as the relation between luminosity

to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state observed in most members of this

unusual soft behavior. By using a mean field model including anisotropic

operate under Rayleigh fading and constant power transmission per node. The
performance of the proposed relaying protocol is evaluated through the progress
rate density (PRD) of the multihop network and compared to the conventional
multihop relaying with no cooperation. We develop an analytic approximation to
the PRD based on the concept of decoding cells. The protocol parameters are
optimized to maximize the PRD of network. We show that the cooperative relaying
protocol provides significant throughput improvements over conventional

incremental redundancy combining provides a higher gain in PRD relative to
repetition combining. The gain in PRD has near constant value at all values of
the path loss exponent and is monotonic in diversity order.

fracture mechanics concepts based on atomistic simulations. The problem of
unstable crack growth at finite temperature, presumably caused by lattice
trapping effect, is circumvented by computing the strain energy release rate
through a series of displacement-controlled tensile loading of SWNTs (applied
through moving the outermost layer of atoms at one end at constant strain rate
of 9.4x10-4/ps) with pre-existing crack-like defects of various lengths. The
strain energy release rate, G, is computed for (17,0), (28,0) and (35,0) SWNTs
(each with aspect ratio 4) with pre-existing cracks up to 29.5{\AA} long. The
fracture resistance, Gc, is determined as a function of crack length for each
tube at three different temperatures (1K, 300K and 500K). A significant
dependence of Gc on crack length is observed reminiscent of the rising R curve
behavior of metals at the macroscale: for the zigzag nanotubes Gc increases
with crack length at small length, and tends to reach a constant value if the
tube diameter is large enough. We suspect that the lattice trapping effect
plays the role of crack tip plasticity at the atomic scale. For example, at 300
Kelvin, Gc for the (35,0) tube with aspect ratio 4 converges to 6 Joule/m2 as
the crack length exceeds 20 Angstrom. This value is comparable with the
fracture toughness of graphite and Silicon. The fracture resistance of the
tubes is found to decrease significantly as the temperature increases. To study
the length effects, the computations are repeated for zigzag nanotubes with the
same three chiralities but with aspect ratio 8 at 1K.

physical and chemical processes surrounding magnetism, and has been a key
ingredient in the spectacular development of magnetic data storage. Existing
approaches using the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE), x-ray and electron
microscopy have limitations that constrain further development, and there is
increasing demand for imaging and characterisation of magnetic phenomena in
real time with high spatial resolution. In this work, we show how the
magneto-optical response of an array of negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy
spins in diamond can be used to image and map the sub-micron stray magnetic
field patterns from thin ferromagnetic films. Using optically detected magnetic
resonance, we demonstrate wide-field magnetic imaging over 100x100 {\mu}m^2
with a diffraction-limited spatial resolution of 440 nm at video frame rates,
under ambient conditions. We demonstrate a novel all-optical spin relaxation
contrast imaging approach which can image magnetic structures in the absence of
an applied microwave field. Straightforward extensions promise imaging with
sub-{\mu}T sensitivity and sub-optical spatial and millisecond temporal
resolution. This work establishes practical diamond-based wide-field microscopy
for rapid high-sensitivity characterisation and imaging of magnetic samples,
with the capability for investigating magnetic phenomena such as domain wall
and skyrmion dynamics and the spin Hall effect in metals.

using FE-SEM, EDX, UV/Visible spectroscopy, XPS, current-voltage measurement,

property of the MOF films are characterized using Hall Effect measurement,

charge transfer induced hole doping into the frameworks. The observed charge
transfer induced hole doping phenomenon is also confirmed by calculating the
densities of states of the as-prepared and iodine doped MOFs based on density

analyzed QNC on a butterfly network, which can create end-to-end Bell pairs at

fidelity of creating two Bell pairs has a small penalty for QNC relative to
entanglement swapping. It will thus be useful when we care more about

shed light on the longstanding issue of whether the dark matter is warm or cold
by combining the measurements of the galaxy luminosity functions out to high
redshifts z~10 from the Hubble Space Telescope with the recent cosmological
data on the reionization history of the Universe from the Planck mission. We
derive robust and tight bounds on the mass of warm dark matter particle,
finding that the current data require it to be in the narrow range between 2
and 3 keV. In addition, we show that a mass not exceeding 3 keV is also
concurrently indicated by astrophysical constraints related to the local number
of satellites in Milky Way-sized galaxies, though it is in marginal tension
with analysis of the Lyman-alpha forest. For warm dark matter masses above 3
keV as well as for cold dark matter, to satisfy the Planck constraints on the
optical depth and not to run into the satellite problem would require invoking
astrophysical processes that inhibit galaxy formation in halos with mass M_H< a
few 10^8 M_sun, corresponding to a limiting UV magnitude M_UV~-11. Anyway, we
predict a downturn of the galaxy luminosity function at z~8 faintward of
M_UV~-12, and stress that its detailed shape is extremely informative both on
particle physics and on the astrophysics of galaxy formation in small halos.
These expectations will be tested via the Hubble Frontier Fields and with the
advent of the James Webb Space Telescope, which will enable probing the very
faint end of the galaxy luminosity function out to z~8-10.

theoretically more than two decades ago. However, until recently they have been
observed in a form of skyrmionic condensates (hexagonal lattices and other
mesophases). In this paper we report experimental and theoretical
investigations of isolated chiral skyrmions discovered in PdFe/Ir(111) bilayers
two years ago (Science 341 , 636 (2013)). The results of spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy analyzed within the continuum and discrete models
provide a consistent description of isolated skyrmions in thin layers. The
existence region of chiral skyrmions is restricted by strip-out instabilities
at low fields and a collapse at high fields. We demonstrate that the same
equations describe axisymmetric localized states in all condensed matter
systems with broken mirror symmetry, and thus our findings establish basic
properties of isolated skyrmions common for chiral liquid crystals, different
classes of noncentrosymmetric magnets, ferroelectrics, and multiferroics.

areas of computer science. We study here the role of randomization in the area
of submodular function maximization. In this area most algorithms are
randomized, and in almost all cases the approximation ratios obtained by
current randomized algorithms are superior to the best results obtained by
known deterministic algorithms. Derandomization of algorithms for general
submodular function maximization seems hard since the access to the function is
done via a value oracle. This makes it hard, for example, to apply standard
derandomization techniques such as conditional expectations. Therefore, an
interesting fundamental problem in this area is whether randomization is
inherently necessary for obtaining good approximation ratios.
  In this work we give evidence that randomization is not necessary for
obtaining good algorithms by presenting a new technique for derandomization of
algorithms for submodular function maximization. Our high level idea is to
maintain explicitly a (small) distribution over the states of the algorithm,
and carefully update it using marginal values obtained from an extreme point
solution of a suitable linear formulation. We demonstrate our technique on two
recent algorithms for unconstrained submodular maximization and for maximizing
submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. In particular, for
unconstrained submodular maximization we obtain an optimal deterministic
$1/2$-approximation showing that randomization is unnecessary for obtaining
optimal results for this setting.

charmonium and charmed-strange mesons, which are calculated in 2+1 flavor
lattice QCD simulations using the PACS-CS gauge configurations generated at the
lightest pion mass ($M_\pi \approx 156(7)$~MeV) with a lattice cutoff of
$a^{-1}\approx 2.2$ GeV and a spatial volume of $(3~{\rm fm})^3$. For the charm
quark, we use a relativistic heavy quark (RHQ) action with fine tuned RHQ
parameters, which closely reproduce both the experimental spin-averaged mass
and hyper-fine splitting of the $1S$ charmonium. The interquark potential and
the quark kinetic mass, both of which are key ingredients within the potential
description of heavy-heavy and heavy-light mesons, are determined from the
equal-time Bethe-Salpeter (BS) amplitude. The charmonium potentials are
obtained from the BS wave function of $1S$ charmonia ($\eta_c$ and $J/\psi$
mesons), while the charmed-strange potential are calculated from the $D_s$ and
$D_s^{\ast}$ heavy-light mesons. We then use resulting potentials and quark
masses as purely theoretical inputs so as to solve the nonrelativistic
Schr\""odinger equation for calculating accessible energy levels of charmonium
and charmed-strange mesons without unknown parameters. The resultant spectra
below the $D\bar{D}$ and $DK$ thresholds excellently agree with
well-established experimental data.

complications associated with prolonged peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy used
for treating the patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF). Recurrent and
persistent infections often cause inflammation of the peritoneum, a condition
known as infectious peritonitis and to resolve the condition, patients require
antibiotic treatment. However, if the treatment is delayed or if it fails due
to antibiotic resistance, the peritonitis may lead to permanent malfunctioning
of peritoneal membrane causing technique failure and transferring the patients
to haemodialysis. Severe and prolonged peritonitis is not only the major cause
of technique failure, it is also the leading cause of mortality and morbidity
in PD patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the existing PD
technique so that the frequency of PD associated infections could be reduced
and infectious peritonitis episodes thereof during prolonged peritoneal
dialysis. In this perspective, I highlight the possibility to improve the PD
technique through the use of antimicrobial nanoparticles synthesized
biologically.

(DFA) using a higher-order polynomial fitting, we establish the direct
connection between DFA and Fourier analysis. Based on an exact calculation of
the single-frequency response of the DFA, the following facts are shown
analytically: (1) in the analysis of stochastic processes exhibiting a
power-law scaling of the power spectral density (PSD), $S(f) \sim f^{-\beta}$,
a higher-order detrending in the DFA has no adverse effect in the estimation of
the DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, which satisfies the scaling relation $\alpha
= (\beta+1)/2$; (2) the upper limit of the scaling exponents detectable by the
DFA depends on the order of polynomial fit used in the DFA, and is bounded by
$m + 1$, where $m$ is the order of the polynomial fit; (3) the relation between
the time scale in the DFA and the corresponding frequency in the PSD are
distorted depending on both the order of the DFA and the frequency dependence
of the PSD. We can improve the scale distortion by introducing the corrected
time scale in the DFA corresponding to the inverse of the frequency scale in
the PSD. In addition, our analytical approach makes it possible to characterize
variants of the DFA using different types of detrending. As an application,
properties of the DFA using moving average filtering are discussed.

correlations decay in powers of inverse logarithm of the spatial separation

years, due to its capability to allow systems with complex dynamics to escape
from regions separated by large entropic barriers. However its performance is
strongly dependent on basic ingredients, such as the choice of the set of
temperatures and their associated weights. Since the weight evaluations are not
trivial tasks, an alternative approximated approach was proposed by Park and
Pande (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 016703 (2007)) to circumvent this difficulty.
Here we present a detailed study about this procedure by comparing its
performance with exact (free-energy) weights and other methods, its dependence
on the total replica number $R$ and on the temperature set. The ideas above are
analyzed in four distinct lattice models presenting strong first-order phase
transitions, hence constituting ideal examples in which the performance of
algorithm is fundamental. In all cases, our results reveal that approximated
weights work properly in the regime of larger $R$'s. On the other hand, for
sufficiently small $R$ its performance is reduced and the systems do not cross
properly the free-energy barriers. Finally, for estimating reliable temperature
sets, we consider a simple protocol proposed at Comp. Phys. Comm. {\bf 128},

determining the rate of black hole mergers and cosmic black hole growth. As
simulations achieve higher resolution, it becomes important to assess whether
the black hole dynamics is influenced by the treatment of the interstellar
medium in different simulation codes. We here compare simulations of black hole
growth in galaxy mergers with two codes: the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
code Gasoline, and the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code Ramses. We seek to
identify predictions of these models that are robust despite differences in
hydrodynamic methods and implementations of sub-grid physics. We find that the
general behavior is consistent between codes. Black hole accretion is minimal
while the galaxies are well-separated (and even as they ""fly-by"" within 10 kpc
at first pericenter). At late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc,
tidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black hole
accretion accompanied by star formation. We also note quantitative
discrepancies that are model-dependent: our Ramses simulations show less star
formation and black hole growth, and a smoother gas distribution with larger
clumps and filaments, than our Gasoline simulations. We attribute these
differences primarily to the sub-grid models for black hole fueling and
feedback and gas thermodynamics. The main conclusion is that differences exist
quantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when making
comparisons with observations. However, reassuringly, both codes capture the
same dynamical behaviors in terms of triggering of black hole accretion, star
formation, and black hole dynamics.

due to magnetic braking for main-sequence stars on the relationship between
stellar rotation and age. In general, this loss rate denoted by $\mathrm
dJ/\mathrm dt$ depends on angular velocity $\Omega$ in the form $\mathrm
dJ/\mathrm dt\propto\Omega^{q}$, where $q$ is a parameter extracted from
nonextensive statistical mechanics. Already, in context of stellar rotation,
this parameter is greater than unity and it is directly related to the braking
index. For $q$ equal to unity, the scenario of saturation of the magnetic field
is recovered, otherwise $q$ indicates an unsaturated field. This new approach
have been proposed and investigated by de Freitas \& De Medeiros for
unsaturated field stars. In present work, we propose a nonextensive approach
for the stellar rotational evolution based on the Reiners \& Mohanthy model. In
this sense, we developed a nonextensive version of Reiners \& Mohanthy torque
and also compare this generalized version with the model proposed in de Freitas
\& De Medeiros based on the spin-down Kawaler torque for the main-sequence
stars with F and G spectral types. We use the same sample of $\sim16 000$ field
stars with rotational velocity $v \sin i$ limited in age and mass. As a result,
we show that the Kawaler and Reiners \& Mohanthy models exhibit strong
discrepancies, mainly in relation to the domain of validity of the entropic
index $q$. These discrepancies are mainly due to sensitivity on the stellar
radius. Finally, our results showed that modified Kawaler prescription is
compatible with a wider mass range, while the Reiners \& Mohanty model is
restricted to masses less than G6 stars.

only a small number of adopting ISPs, customers can obtain high availability

error event occurs in wireless sensor networks, including sensing and
communication errors. We consider a scenario where sensors need to identify
whether a given event has occurred based on its periodic, noisy, observations
of a given signal. Such information about the signal needs to be sent to a
fusion center that decides about the actual state at that specific observation
time. The communication links -- single- or multi-hop -- are modeled as binary
symmetric channels, which may have different error probabilities. The decision
at the fusion center is based on OR, AND, K-OUT-OF-N and MAJORITY Boolean
operations on the received signals associated to individual sensor
observations. We derive closed-form equations for the average decision error
probability as a function of the system parameters (e.g. number of sensors and
hops) and the input signal characterization. Our analyses show the best
decision rule is closely related to the frequency that the observed events
occur and the number of sensors. In our numerical example, we show that the AND
rule outperforms MAJORITY if such an event is rare and there is only a handful
number of sensors. Conversely, if there is a large number of sensors or more
evenly distributed event occurrences, the MAJORITY is the best choice. We
further show that, while the error probability using the MAJORITY rule
asymptotically goes to 0 with increasing number of sensors, it is also more
susceptible to higher channel error probabilities.

  arXiv:1404.4171",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dropout and other feature noising schemes have shown promising results in
controlling over-fitting by artificially corrupting the training data. Though
extensive theoretical and empirical studies have been performed for generalized
linear models, little work has been done for support vector machines (SVMs),
one of the most successful approaches for supervised learning. This paper
presents dropout training for both linear SVMs and the nonlinear extension with
latent representation learning. For linear SVMs, to deal with the intractable
expectation of the non-smooth hinge loss under corrupting distributions, we
develop an iteratively re-weighted least square (IRLS) algorithm by exploring
data augmentation techniques. Our algorithm iteratively minimizes the
expectation of a re-weighted least square problem, where the re-weights are
analytically updated. For nonlinear latent SVMs, we consider learning one layer
of latent representations in SVMs and extend the data augmentation technique in
conjunction with first-order Taylor-expansion to deal with the intractable
expected non-smooth hinge loss and the nonlinearity of latent representations.
Finally, we apply the similar data augmentation ideas to develop a new IRLS
algorithm for the expected logistic loss under corrupting distributions, and we
further develop a non-linear extension of logistic regression by incorporating
one layer of latent representations. Our algorithms offer insights on the
connection and difference between the hinge loss and logistic loss in dropout
training. Empirical results on several real datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of dropout training on significantly boosting the classification
accuracy of both linear and nonlinear SVMs. In addition, the nonlinear SVMs
further improve the prediction performance on several image datasets.

sets of pairs of sequential measurements on a single quantum system can be
consistent with an underlying notion of macrorealism. Here, the LG inequalities
are explored using a simple quasi-probability linear in the projection
operators to describe the properties of the system at two times. We show that
this quasi-probability is measurable, has the same correlation function as the
usual two-time measurement probability (for the bivalent variables considered
here) and has the key property that the probabilities for the later time are
independent of whether an earlier measurement was made, a generalization of the
no-signalling in time condition of Kofler and Brukner. We argue that this
quasi-probability, appropriately measured, provides a non-invasive measure of
macrorealism per se at the two time level. This measure, when combined with the
LG inequalities, provides a characterization of macrorealism more detailed than
that provided by the LG inequalities alone. When the quasi-probability is
non-negative, the LG system has a natural parallel with the EPRB system and
Fine's theorem. A simple spin model illustrating key features of the approach

Here we aim at identifying the imprint of SN 1987A on the X-ray emission of its
remnant and at constraining the structure of the environment surrounding the
supernova. We performed high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations describing SN
1987A soon after the core-collapse and the following three-dimensional
expansion of its remnant between days 1 and 15000 after the supernova. We
demonstrated that the physical model reproducing the main observables of SN
1987A during the first 250 days of evolution reproduces also the X-ray emission
of the subsequent expanding remnant, thus bridging the gap between supernovae
and supernova remnants. By comparing model results with observations, we
constrained the explosion energy in the range $1.2-1.4\times 10^{51}$~erg and
the envelope mass in the range $15-17 M_{\odot}$. We found that the shape of
X-ray lightcurves and spectra at early epochs (<15 years) reflects the
structure of outer ejecta: our model reproduces the observations if the
outermost ejecta have a post-explosion radial profile of density approximated
by a power law with index $\alpha = -8$. At later epochs, the shapes of X-ray
lightcurves and spectra reflect the density structure of the nebula around SN
1987A. This enabled us to ascertain the origin of the multi-thermal X-ray
emission, to disentangle the imprint of the supernova on the remnant emission
from the effects of the remnant interaction with the environment, and to

sawtooth trailing-edges, resulting in an inhomogeneous partial differential
equation. The equation is then solved by means of a Fourier expansion technique
combined with an iterative procedure. The solution is validated through
comparison with finite element method for a variety of serrations at different
Mach numbers. Results obtained using the new model predict noise reduction of
up to 10 dB at 90 degree above the trailing-edge, which is more realistic than
predictions based on Howe's model and also more consistent with experimental
observations. A thorough analytical and numerical analysis of the physical
mechanism is carried out and suggests that the noise reduction due to serration
originates primarily from interference effects near the trailing-edge. A closer
inspection of the proposed mathematical model has led to the development of two
criteria for the effectiveness of the trailing-edge serrations, consistent but
more general than those proposed by Howe. While experimental investigations
often focus on noise reduction at ninety degrees above the trailing-edge, the
new analytical model shows that the destructive interference scattering effects
due to the serrations cause significant noise reduction at large polar angles,
near the leading edge. It has also been observed that serrations can
significantly change the directivity characteristics of the aerofoil at high
frequencies and even lead to noise increase at high Mach numbers.

at the QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) level at the Large Hadron Collider,
using the narrow width approximation and helicity amplitudes method. We find
that the QCD NLO corrections can tighten the constraints on the model
parameters and reduce the scale dependencies of the total cross sections. We
discuss the signals of the excited quark production with decay mode
$q^{\ast}\rightarrow q\gamma$ and $q^{\ast}\rightarrow qg$, and present several
important kinematic distributions. Moreover, we give the upper limits of the
excited quark excluded mass range and the allowed parameter space for the
coupling constants and the excited quark mass.

dipolar particles in a confined geometry and in fields tilted relative to the
confinement axis. Using tesseral harmonics instead of the usual spherical
harmonics to expand the scattering wavefunction, we recover a good quantum
number $\xi = \pm 1$ which is conserved during the collision. We derive the
general expression of the dipole-dipole interaction in this convenient basis
set as a function of the polar and azimuthal angles of the fields. We apply the
formalism to the collision of fermionic and bosonic polar KRb molecules in a
tilted electric field and in a one-dimensional optical lattice. The presence of
a tilted field drastically changes the magnitude of the reactive and inelastic
rates as well as the inelastic threshold properties at vanishing collision
energies. Setting an appropriate strength of the confinement for the fermionic
system, we show that the ultracold particles can even further reduce their
kinetic energy by inelastic excitation to higher states of the confinement
trap.

investigate the conditions to support traversable wormholes by the
gravitational effects of spacetime parity and topology, which arise from the
nonminimal couplings of a background scalar field to the Chern-Pontryagin
density and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The flaring-out condition indicates
that a Morris-Thorne-type wormhole can be maintained by violating the
generalized null energy condition, and thus also breaking down the generalized
weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions; meanwhile, analyses of the
zero-tidal-force solution show that the standard null energy condition in
general relativity can still be respected by the physical matter threading the
wormhole. This way, the two topological effects have to dominate over the
ordinary-matter source of gravity, and the scalar field is preferred to be
noncanonical. By treating Brans-Dicke gravity as a reduced situation of
Lovelock-Brans-Dicke gravity, we also examine the Brans-Dicke wormholes and
energy conditions.

semitone frequency ratio of $2^{1/12}$. Although this temperament has been in
use since the 19th century and in spite of its high degree of symmetry, various
musicians have repeatedly expressed their discomfort with the harmonicity of
certain intervals. Recently it was suggested that this problem can be overcome
by introducing a modified temperament with a constant but slightly increased
frequency ratio. In this paper we confirm this conjecture quantitatively. Using
entropy as a measure for harmonicity, we show numerically that the harmonic
optimum is in fact obtained for frequency ratios larger than $2^{1/12}$. This
suggests that the equal temperament should be replaced by a harmonized
temperament as a new standard.
