Lagrangian equilibrium points L4 and L5, in the framework of the Circular
Planar Restricted Three-Body Problem (hereafter, CPRTBP). We design a
semi-analytic approach based on some ideas by Garfinkel in [4]: the Hamiltonian
is expanded in Poincar\'e-Delaunay coordinates and a suitable average is
performed. This allows us to construct (quasi) invariant tori that are
moderately far from the Lagrangian points L4-L5 and approximate wide tadpole
orbits. This construction provides the tools for studying optimal transfers in
the neighborhood of the equilateral points, when instantaneous impulses are
considered. We show some applications of the new averaged Hamiltonian for the
Earth-Moon system, applied to the setting-up of some transfers which allow to
enter in the stability region filled by tadpole orbits.

quantum mechanics and is responsible for the emergence of macroscopic

because it is nontrivial to discriminate unambiguously their presence in
experiments where other hardly controllable sources of noise compete to the
overall decoherence. Here we provide a simple procedure able to probe the
hypothetical presence of the collapse noise with a levitated nanosphere in a
Fabry-Perot cavity. We show that the stationary state of the system is
particularly sensitive, under specific experimental conditions, to the

diffusion induced by the collapse models, allowing to detect them even in the

Weihrauch lattice. Our central results provide information on how Ramsey's
theorem behaves under product, parallelization and jumps. From these results we
can derive a number of important properties of Ramsey's theorem. For one, the
parallelization of Ramsey's theorem for cardinality $n\geq1$ and an arbitrary
finite number of colors $k\geq2$ is equivalent to the $n$--th jump of weak
K\H{o}nig's lemma. In particular, Ramsey's theorem for cardinality $n\geq1$ is
$\Sigma^0_{n+2}$--measurable in the effective Borel hierarchy, but not
$\Sigma^0_{n+1}$--measurable. Secondly, we obtain interesting lower bounds, for
instance the $n$--th jump of weak K\H{o}nig's lemma is Weihrauch reducible to
(the stable version of) Ramsey's theorem of cardinality $n+2$ for $n\geq2$. We
prove that with strictly increasing numbers of colors Ramsey's theorem forms a
strictly increasing chain in the Weihrauch lattice. Our study of jumps also
shows that certain uniform variants of Ramsey's theorem that are
indistinguishable from a non-uniform perspective play an important role. For
instance, the colored version of Ramsey's theorem explicitly includes the color
of the homogeneous set as output information, and the jump of this problem (but
not the uncolored variant) is equivalent to the stable version of Ramsey's
theorem of the next greater cardinality. Finally, we briefly discuss the
particular case of Ramsey's theorem for pairs, and we provide some new
separation techniques for problems that involve jumps in this context. In
particular, we study uniform results regarding the relation of boundedness and
induction problems to Ramsey's theorem, and we show that there are some
significant differences with the non-uniform situation in reverse mathematics.

of Rh and Mn provides an improvement in the thermal stability with some
degradation of the magnetic properties. The small amounts of Rh and Mn
additions in MnBi stabilize an orthorhombic phase whose structural and magnetic
properties are closely related to the ones of the previously reported
high-temperature phase of MnBi (HT~MnBi). To date, the properties of the
HT~MnBi, which is stable between $613$ and $719$~K, have not been studied in
detail because of its transformation to the stable low-temperature MnBi
(LT~MnBi), making measurements near and below its Curie temperature difficult.
The Rh-stabilized MnBi with chemical formula Mn$_{1.0625-x}$Rh$_{x}$Bi
[$x=0.02(1)$] adopts a new superstructure of the NiAs/Ni$_2$In structure
family. It is ferromagnetic below a Curie temperature of $416$~K. The critical
exponents of the ferromagnetic transition are not of the mean-field type but
are closer to those associated with the Ising model in three dimensions. The
magnetic anisotropy is uniaxial; the anisotropy energy is rather large, and it
does not increase when raising the temperature, contrary to what happens in
LT~MnBi. The saturation magnetization is approximately $3$~$\mu_B$/f.u. at low
temperatures. While this exact composition may not be application ready, it
does show that alloying is a viable route to modifying the stability of this
class of rare-earth-free magnet alloys.

phase variables is crucial for the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of
excitons. Employing the path-integral formalism, we manipulate the bosonic and
fermionic degrees of freedom to obtain the effective actions related to
fermionic and bosonic sectors. Considering the normal and anomalous excitonic
Green functions, we calculate the spectral functions, which have the forms of
convolutions in the reciprocal space between bosonic and fermionic
counterparts. For the fermionic incoherent part of the DOS we have found the
strong evidence of the hybridization-gap in DOS spectra. Furthermore,
considering Bogoliubov coherence mechanism, we calculate the coherent DOS
spectra. For the coherent normal fermionic DOS, there is no hybridization-gap
found in the system due to strong coherence effets and phase stiffness. The
similar behavior is observed also for the condensate part of the anomalous
excitonic DOS spectra. We show that for small values of the Coulomb
interaction, fermionic DOS exhibits a Bardeen-Cooper-Schriffer (BCS) -like
double-peak structure. In the BEC region of the BCS-BEC crossover, the
double-peak structure disappears totally for both: coherent and incoherent DOS

time-reversal symmetry is preserved upon entering the superconducting state in
both materials; a small difference in depolarization is observed above and
below the superconducting transition in both compounds, however this has been
attributed to quasistatic magnetic fluctuations. Transverse-field measurements
of the flux-line lattice indicate that the superconductivity in both materials
is fully gapped, with a conventional s-wave pairing symmetry and BCS-like
magnitudes for the zero-temperature gap energies. The electronic properties of
the charge carriers in the superconducting state have been calculated, with
effective masses $m^*/ m_\mathrm{e} = $ $9.8\pm0.1$ and $15.0\pm0.1$ in the Lu
and Y compounds, respectively, with superconducting carrier densities
$n_\mathrm{s} = $ ($2.73\pm0.04$) $\times 10^{28}$ m$^{-3}$ and ($2.17\pm0.02$)
$\times 10^{28}$ m$^{-3}$. The materials have been classified according to the
Uemura scheme for superconductivity, with values for
$T_\mathrm{c}/T_\mathrm{F}$ of $1/(414\pm6)$ and $1/(304\pm3)$, implying that
the superconductivity may not be entirely conventional in nature.

dynamics. In the context of population models they allow for the description of
the transition from the vicinity of a non-trivial fixed point of the

become extinct. To characterize analytically the fluctuations of a given
stochastic population model, one can operate within the so-called linear-noise
approximation. Here the fluctuations are taken to be Gaussian, and the
phenomenon of extinction is so rare as to be negligible, for all practical
purposes. When the size of the population becomes small, non-Gaussian
fluctuations are instead found. Two analytical schemes are in principle
available to determine the nature of the distribution of associated

Galerkin--Kantorovich method, we show that for supercritical electric dipole
the wave function of the electron bound state changes its localization from the

corresponds to the electron and hole spontaneously created from the vacuum in

the supercriticality of novel type to occur is that the energy levels of single
positively and negatively charged impurities traverse together the energy
distance separating the upper and lower continua. The robustness of the
supercriticality of novel type is confirmed by the study of an exactly solvable

environment's dynamic by a level of precision which allows it to effectively
foresee opportunities and threats. Under the assumption that such intelligence
relies on a knowledge space any effective reasoning would benefit from a
maximum portion of useful and a minimum portion of misleading knowledge
fragments. It begs the question of how the quality of such knowledge space can
be kept high as the amount of knowledge keeps growing. This article proposes a
mathematical model to describe general principles of how quality of a growing
knowledge space evolves depending on error rate, error propagation and
countermeasures. There is also shown to which extend the quality of a knowledge
space collapses as removal of low quality knowledge fragments occurs too slowly
for a given knowledge space's growth rate.

  (Full Text)",,,,,"cs.CG cs.CC cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the oritatami model for molecular co-transcriptional folding. In
oritatami systems, the transcript (the ""molecule"") folds as it is synthesized
(transcribed), according to a local energy optimisation process, which is
similar to how actual biomolecules such as RNA fold into complex shapes and
functions as they are transcribed. We prove that there is an oritatami system
embedding universal computation in the folding process itself.
  Our result relies on the development of a generic toolbox, which is easily
reusable for future work to design complex functions in oritatami systems. We
develop ""low-level"" tools that allow to easily spread apart the encoding of
different ""functions"" in the transcript, even if they are required to be
applied at the same geometrical location in the folding. We build upon these
low-level tools, a programming framework with increasing levels of abstraction,
from encoding of instructions into the transcript to logical analysis. This
framework is similar to the hardware-to-algorithm levels of abstractions in
standard algorithm theory. These various levels of abstractions allow to
separate the proof of correctness of the global behavior of our system, from
the proof of correctness of its implementation. Thanks to this framework, we
were able to computerize the proof of correctness of its implementation and
produce certificates, in the form of a relatively small number of proof trees,
compact and easily readable and checkable by human, while encapsulating huge
case enumerations. We believe this particular type of certificates can be
generalized to other discrete dynamical systems, where proofs involve large
case enumerations as well.

Over the period of six days from 2011 February 11 to 16, the temporal variation
in the magnitude of total velocity is found to follow the trend of magnetic
field strength. We further analyze regions of individual magnetic polarity
within AR 11158 and find that the horizontal velocity components in these

trailing polarity regions move faster than the mixed-polarity region. Further,
both zonal and meridional components have opposite signs for trailing and
leading polarity regions at all depths showing divergent flows within the

horizontal velocity in deeper layer around major flares. It is suggested that
the re-organization of magnetic fields during flares combined with the sunspot
rotation decreases the magnitude of horizontal flows or that the flow kinetic
energy has been converted into the energy released by flares. After the decline
in flare activity and the sunspot rotation, the flows tend to follow the
pattern of the magnetic activity.We also observe less variation in the velocity
components near the surface but these tend to increase with depth, further
demonstrating that the deeper layers are more affected by the topology of

First, we design two non-cooperative games to solve the problem and show the
existence of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in both games. These equilibria are

high information exchange of BRD, a completely distributed algorithm, based on
the theory of learning, is proposed. Simulations show that this algorithm has
tight-to-optimal performance and further it converges to a PNE (when existing)

broader concept of the non-adiabatic pairing mediated by phonons with frequency
comparable or larger the Fermi energy. We argue that, for carrier
concentrations exceeding that of the mobility edge, the superconductivity of
doped SrTiO3 is mediated by interaction of electrons with several longitudinal
(LO) optical polar phonons. The electronic spectrum of SrTiO3 consists at low
temperatures of three conduction bands which are successively doped. Each band
contributes to the Cooper instability and exhibits a superconducting gap in the
energy spectrum. The theory presented below predicts maxima in dependence of
Tc(n)-the transition temperature on n, the number of electrons owing to the
following mechanism. Doping by electrons increases density of states at the
Fermi surface and Tc initially grows up. At the same time, screening on the
part of accumulating charges tends to reduce amplitude of the electrical fields
inherent in LO phonon modes and at larger concentrations the matrix element of
interaction between electrons and LO phonons decreases. The compromise between
the two tendencies leads to maxima in the Tc(n)-dependence providing
interpretation to one of the most intriguing experimental findings in Xiao Lin
et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 207002 (2014)]. Having reached a maximum in the
third band, the superconducting transition finally decreases, rounding out the
Tc(n)-dome, the three maxima in Tc(n)with accompanying superconducting gaps
emerging consecutively as electrons fill successive bands. This arises from
attributes of the LO optical phonon pairing mechanism. More generally, the
mechanism opens prospect of increasing temperature of the superconducting
transition in transition-metals oxides and other polar crystals.

Studies of their kinematics is key to understanding what triggers their
unusually active star formation In this work we investigate the kinematics of
stars and ionised gas in Haro11, one of the most luminous blue compact galaxies
in the local universe. Previous works have indicated that many such galaxies
may be triggered by galaxy mergers. We have employed Fabry-Perot
interferometry, long-slit spectroscopy and Integral Field Unit (IFU)
spectroscopy to explore the kinematics of Haro11. We target the near infrared
Calcium triplet to derive the stellar velocity field and velocity dispersion.
Ionised gas is analysed through emission lines from hydrogen, [OIII] , and
[SIII]. When spectral resolution and signal to noise allows we investigate the
the line profile in detail and identify multiple velocity components when
present. We find that to first order, the velocity field and velocity
dispersions derived from stars and ionised gas agree. Hence the complexities
reveal real dynamical disturbances providing further evidence for a merger in
Haro11. Through decomposition of emission lines we find evidence for
kinematically distinct components, for instance a tidal arm behind the galaxy.
The ionised gas velocity field can be traced to large galactocentric radii, and
shows significant velocity dispersion even far out in the halo. We discuss the
origin of the line width, and interpreted as virial motions it indicates a mass
of ~1E11 M_sun. Morphologically and kinematically Haro11 shows many
resemblances with the famous Antennae galaxies, but is much denser which is the
likely explanation for the higher star formation efficiency in Haro11.

popularity for the Stat 101 course, due in part to increasing evidence of the
methods ability to improve students' statistical thinking. This impact comes
from simulation-based methods (a) clearly presenting the overarching logic of
inference, (b) strengthening ties between statistics and probability or
mathematical concepts, (c) encouraging a focus on the entire research process,
(d) facilitating student thinking about advanced statistical concepts, (e)
allowing more time to explore, do, and talk about real research and messy data,
and (f) acting as a firmer foundation on which to build statistical intuition.
Thus, we argue that simulation-based inference should be an entry point to an
undergraduate statistics program for all students, and that simulation-based
inference should be used throughout all undergraduate statistics courses. In
order to achieve this goal and fully recognize the benefits of simulation-based
inference on the undergraduate statistics program we will need to break free of
historical forces tying undergraduate statistics curricula to mathematics,
consider radical and innovative new pedagogical approaches in our courses,
fully implement assessment-driven content innovations, and embrace computation

considered in the framework of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. Our main
focus is on the formation of ionization supercontinua. More specifically, when
studying the energy distributions of photoelectrons ionized by circularly
polarized pulses, we observe the appearance of broad structures lacking the
interference patterns. These supercontinua extend over hundreds of driving
photon energies, thus corresponding to high-order nonlinear processes. The
corresponding polar-angle distributions show asymmetries which are attributed
to the radiation pressure experienced by photoelectrons. Moreover, our time

of short duration. While we present the fully numerical results, their

complementary non-perturbative features of the QCD confinement cross-over phase

degrees of freedom and (2) the emergence of chromo-magnetic monopole degrees of
freedom. Such a semi-Quark-Gluon-Monopole Plasma (sQGMP) microscopic scenario
is tested by comparing predictions of the leading hadron nuclear modification
factors, $R^h_{AA}(p_T>10{\rm GeV/c},\sqrt{s})$, and their azimuthal elliptic
asymmetry $v^h_2(p_T>10{\rm GeV/c},\sqrt{s})$ with available data on
$h=\pi,D,B$ jet fragments from nuclear collisions at RHIC($\sqrt{s}=0.2$ ATeV)

standing $R_{AA}$ vs $v_2$ puzzle by predicting a maximum of the jet quenching
parameter field $\hat{q}(E,T)/T^3$ near $T_c$. The consistency of jet quenching
with observed bulk perfect fluidity is demonstrated by extrapolating the sQGMP
$\hat{q}$ down to thermal energy $E\sim 3 T$ scales and showing that the sQGMP
shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s \approx T^3/\hat{q}$ falls
close to the unitarity bound, $1/4\pi$, in the range $(1-2)T_c$. Detailed
comparisons of CUJET2.0 and CUJET3.0 reveal that the remarkably different
$\hat{q}(T)$ could be consistent with the same $R_{AA}$ data and could only be
distinguished by anisotropy observables. These findings demonstrate clearly the
inadequacy of focusing on the jet path averaged quantity $<\hat{q}>$ as the
only relevant medium property to characterize jet quenching, and point to the
crucial roles of other essential factors, such as the chromo electric and
magnetic composites of the plasma, the screening masses and the running

surveys, as they are thought to have more massive giant planets relative to
solar-type stars. However, most imaging is only sensitive to orbital
separations $>$30 AU, where it has been demonstrated that giant planets are
rare. In this survey, we take advantage of the high-contrast capabilities of
the Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph on NACO at the Very Large Telescope.
Combined with optimized principal component analysis post-processing, we are
sensitive to planetary-mass companions (2 to 12 $M_{\rm Jup}$) at Solar System
scales ($\leq$30 AU). We obtained data on 13 stars in L'-band and detected one
new companion as part of this survey: an M$6.0\pm0.5$ dwarf companion around HD
984. We re-detect low-mass companions around HD 12894 and HD 20385, both
reported shortly after the completion of this survey. We use Monte Carlo
simulations to determine new constraints on the low-mass ($<$80 $M_{\rm Jup}$)
companion frequency, as a function of mass and separation. Assuming solar-type
planet mass and separation distributions, normalized to the planet frequency
appropriate for A-stars, and the observed companion mass-ratio distribution for
stellar companions extrapolated to planetary masses, we derive a truncation
radius for the planetary mass companion surface density of $<$135 AU at 95%
confidence.

G' is an arbitrary group that may include spatial symmetries and/or time

strictly d=2 systems, but can occur at surfaces of d=3 symmetry protected
topological (SPT) phases. This observation leads to examples of d=3 bosonic
topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) that, to our knowledge, have not
previously been identified. In some cases, these d=3 bosonic TCIs can have an
anomalous superfluid at the surface, which is characterized by non-trivial
projective transformations of the superfluid vortices under symmetry. The basic
idea of our anomaly test is to introduce fluxes of the U(1) symmetry, and to
show that some fractionalization patterns cannot be extended to a consistent
action of G' symmetry on the fluxes. For some anomalies, this can be described
in terms of dimensional reduction to d=1 SPT phases. We apply our method to
several different symmetry groups with non-trivial anomalies, including G =

that of the fractional quantum Hall effect. The supersymmetry allows us to
solve the theory analytically. We quantise the vortices and, by relating their
dynamics to a matrix model, show that their ground state wavefunction is in the
same universality class as the Laughlin state. We further construct coherent
state representations of the excitations of a finite number of vortices. These
are quasi-holes. By an explicit computation of the Berry phase, without
resorting to a plasma analogy, we show that these excitations have fractional

The Caldeira-Leggett model, a successful paradigm of quantum Brownian motion,
views the environment as a collection of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled
to the system. However, symmetry considerations may forbid a linear coupling,
e.g. for a neutral particle in quantum electrodynamics. We argue that nonlinear
couplings can lead to a fundamentally different behavior. Specifically, we
consider a heavy particle quadratically coupled to quantum fluctuations of the

a power-law distribution in space, reminiscent of L\'evy flights. We suggest
condensed matter analogs where similar effects may arise.

non-linear description of the real-space matter power-spectrum and include the
lowest-order redshift-space correction (Kaiser effect), taking into account
some additional non-linear contributions. Ignoring relativistic corrections,
which are not expected to play an important role for a shallow survey, we
analyse two different modified gravity scenarios, namely the generalised
Dilaton scalar-tensor theories and the $f({R})$ models in the large curvature
regime. We compute the 3D power spectrum ${\cal C}^s_{\ell}(k_1,k_2)$ for
various such MG theories with and without redshift space distortions, assuming
precise knowledge of background cosmological parameters. Using an all-sky
spectroscopic survey with Gaussian selection function $\varphi(r)\propto
\exp(-{r^2 / r^2_0})$, $r_0 = 150 \, h^{-1} \, {\textrm{Mpc}}$, and number
density of galaxies $\bar {\textrm{N}} =10^{-4}\;{\textrm{Mpc}}^{-3}$, we use a
$\chi^2$ analysis, and find that the lower-order $(\ell \leq 25)$ multipoles of
${\cal C}^s_\ell(k,k')$ (with radial modes restricted to $k < 0.2 \, h
\,{\textrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$) can constraint the parameter $f_{R_0}$ at a level of
$2\times 10^{-5} (3\times 10^{-5})$ with $3 \sigma$ confidence for $n=1(2)$.
Combining constraints from higher $\ell > 25$ modes can further reduce the
error bars and thus in principle make cosmological gravity constraints
competitive with solar system tests. However this will require an accurate
modelling of non-linear redshift space distortions. Using a tomographic

complex dust spatial distribution. We present a radiative transfer model
accounting for the observed gaps and bright rings as well as radial changes of
the emissivity index. We find that the dust density is depleted by at least a
factor 10 in the main gaps compared to the surrounding rings. Ring masses range
from 10-100 M$_{\oplus}$ in dust, and, we find that each of the deepest gaps is
consistent with the removal of up to 40 M$_{\oplus}$ of dust. If this material
has accumulated into rocky bodies, these would be close to the point of runaway
gas accretion. Our model indicates that the outermost ring is depleted in
millimetre grains compared to the central rings. This suggests faster grain
growth in the central regions and/or radial migration of the larger grains. The
morphology of the gaps observed by ALMA - well separated and showing a high
degree of contrast with the bright rings over all azimuths - indicates that the
millimetre dust disc is geometrically thin (scale height $\approx$ 1 au at 100
au) and that a large amount of settling of large grains has already occurred.
Assuming a standard dust settling model, we find that the observations are
consistent with a turbulent viscosity coefficient of a few $10^{-4}$. We
estimate the gas/dust ratio in this thin layer to be of the order of 5 if the
initial ratio is 100. The HCO$^+$ and CO emission is consistent with gas in
Keplerian motion around a 1.7 $M_\odot$ star at radii from $\leq 10 - 120\,$au.

puzzling electron correlation effects in FeSe superconductors. It produces a
strongly renormalized low-energy band structure where the van Hove singularity
sits remarkably close to Fermi level in the high-temperature electron liquid

order in the $d$-wave channel. We argue that this emergent low-temperature

degeneracies at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. We present a
symmetry analysis of the space group and identify the hidden antiunitary

order/interaction that can break the symmetry and lift the degeneracy. We show
that the $d$-wave nematic bond order, together with the spin-orbit coupling,

realistic energy balance in which we observe oscillations of a loop in
synthesised coronal emission. We use these results to test the inversions based
on coronal seismology.
  From the simulation of the corona above an active region we synthesise
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission from the model corona. From this we derive
maps of line intensity and Doppler shift providing synthetic data in the same
format as obtained from observations. We fit the (Doppler) oscillation of the
loop in the same fashion as done for observations to derive the oscillation
period and damping time.
  The loop oscillation seen in our model is similar to imaging and
spectroscopic observations of the Sun. The velocity disturbance of the kink
oscillation shows an oscillation period of 52.5s and a damping time of 125s,
both being consistent with the ranges of periods and damping times found in
observation. Using standard coronal seismology techniques, we find an average
magnetic field strength of $B_{\rm kink}=79$G for our loop in the simulation,
while in the loop the field strength drops from some 300G at the coronal base
to 50G at the apex. Using the data from our simulation we can infer what the
average magnetic field derived from coronal seismology actually means. It is
close to the magnetic field strength in a constant cross-section flux tube that
would give the same wave travel time through the loop.
  Our model produced not only a realistic looking loop-dominated corona, but
also provides realistic information on the oscillation properties that can be
used to calibrate and better understand the result from coronal seismology.

combination of nonlinear saturation effects and the presence of thermal or

significantly from the usual dynamical picture. We observe additional phases
with preserved or `weakly' broken PT symmetry, and an unconventional transition
from a high-noise thermal state to a low-amplitude lasing state with broken

however the regularization of their quantum corrections introduces a
dimensionful coupling (dimensional regularization) or scale (Pauli-Villars,
etc) which break this symmetry explicitly. We show how to avoid this problem
and study the implications of a manifestly scale invariant regularization in
(classical) scale invariant theories. We use a dilaton-dependent subtraction
function $\mu(\sigma)$ which after spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry
generates the usual DR subtraction scale $\mu(\langle\sigma\rangle)$. One
consequence is that ""evanescent"" interactions generated by scale invariance of
the action in $d=4-2\epsilon$ (but vanishing in $d=4$), give rise to new,
finite quantum corrections. We find a (finite) correction $\Delta
U(\phi,\sigma)$ to the one-loop scalar potential for $\phi$ and $\sigma$,
beyond the Coleman-Weinberg term. $\Delta U$ is due to an evanescent correction
($\propto\epsilon$) to the field-dependent masses (of the states in the loop)
which multiplies the pole ($\propto 1/\epsilon$) of the momentum integral, to
give a finite quantum result. $\Delta U$ contains a non-polynomial operator
$\sim \phi^6/\sigma^2$ of known coefficient and is independent of the
subtraction dimensionless parameter. A more general $\mu(\phi,\sigma)$ is ruled
out since, in their classical decoupling limit, the visible sector (of the
higgs $\phi$) and hidden sector (dilaton $\sigma$) still interact at the
quantum level, thus the subtraction function must depend on the dilaton only.

level over more than ten years of data. However the radial velocities of some
stars are contaminated by a spurious one-year signal with an amplitude that can
be as high as a few m s-1 . This signal is in opposition of phase with the
revolution of Earth around the Sun, and can be explained by the deformation of
spectral lines crossing block stitchings of the CCD when the spectrum of an
observed star is alternatively blue- and red-shifted due to the motion of Earth
around the Sun. This annual perturbation can be supress by either removing
those affected spectral lines from the correlation mask used by the cross
correlation technique to derive precise radial velocities, or by simply fitting
a yearly sinusoid to the RV data. This is mandatory if we want to detect
long-period low-amplitude signals in the HARPS radial velocities of quiet
solar-type stars.

the lattice-mismatch-induced compressive strain leads to a strong polarization
in the CZO film, and as the CZO film thickness increases, there exist an
insulator-to-metal transition. The polarization direction and critical
thickness of the CZO film for forming interfacial metallic states depend on the
surface termination of CZO film in both types of interface models. In the
TiO2/CaO and SrO/ZrO2 interface models with CaO surface termination, the strong
polarization drives the charge transfer from the CZO film to the first few TiO2
layers in the STO substrate, leading to the formation of Two-Dimensional
Electron Gas (2DEG) at the interface. In the HS models with ZrO2 surface
termination, two polarization domains with opposite directions were formed in
the CZO film, which results in the charge transfer from the middle CZO layer to
the interface and surface, respectively, leading to the co-existence of the
2DEG on the interface and the Two-Dimensional Hole Gas (2DHG) at the middle CZO

SN 2011ay belongs to the recently defined class of SNe Iax, which is also
supported by the properties of its light and color curves. The estimated
photospheric temperature around maximum light, T_{phot} ~8,000 K, is lower than

in the spectra of SN 2011ay, even during the early phases. We also show that
strong blending with metal features (those of Ti II, Fe II, Co II) makes the
direct analysis of the broad spectral features very difficult, and this may be
true for all SNe Iax. We find two alternative spectrum models that both
describe the observed spectra adequately, but their photospheric velocities
differ by at least 3,000 km/s. The quasi-bolometric light curve of SN~2011ay

relative distance $1-d/q$ and can be list decoded from a $1-O(\sqrt{d/q})$
fraction of errors. In this work, for $d \ll q$, we give a length-efficient
puncturing of such codes which (almost) retains the distance and list
decodability properties of the Reed-Muller code, but has much better rate.
Specificially, when $q =\Omega( d^2/\epsilon^2)$, we given an explicit rate
$\Omega\left(\frac{\epsilon}{d!}\right)$ puncturing of Reed-Muller codes which
have relative distance at least $(1-\epsilon)$ and efficient list decoding up
to $(1-\sqrt{\epsilon})$ error fraction. This almost matches the performance of
random puncturings which work with the weaker field size requirement $q=

optimal (up to constant factors) $q =\Omega( d/\epsilon)$, at the expense of a
worse list decoding radius of $1-\epsilon^{1/3}$ and rate

  The first of the above trade-offs is obtained by substituting for the
variables functions with carefully chosen pole orders from an algebraic

decodable). The second trade-off is obtained by concatenating this construction
with a Reed-Solomon based multiplication friendly pair, and using the list
recovery property of algebraic-geometric codes.

One of the

protein searching and recognizing specific binding sites on DNA. A large number
of experimental and theoretical investigations have been devoted to uncovering
the molecular description of these phenomena, but many aspects of the
mechanisms of protein search for the targets on DNA remain not well understood.
One of the most intriguing problems is the role of multiple targets in protein
search dynamics. Using a recently developed theoretical framework we analyze
this question in detail. Our method is based on a discrete-state stochastic
approach that takes into account most relevant physical-chemical processes and
leads to fully analytical description of all dynamic properties. Specifically,
systems with two and three targets have been explicitly investigated. It is
found that multiple targets in most cases accelerate the search in comparison
with a single target situation. However, the acceleration is not always
proportional to the number of targets. Surprisingly, there are even situations
when it takes longer to find one of the multiple targets in comparison with the
single target. It depends on the spatial position of the targets, distances
between them, average scanning lengths of protein molecules on DNA, and the
total DNA lengths. Physical-chemical explanations of observed results are
presented. Our predictions are compared with experimental observations as well
as with results from a continuum theory for the protein search. Extensive Monte

from the Current Population Survey (CPS) as a key input to develop employment
estimates for counties within the states. The monthly CPS by-state totals,
however, express high levels of volatility that compromise the accuracy of
resulting estimates composed for the counties. Typically-employed models for
small area estimation produce de-noised, state-level employment estimates by
borrowing information over the survey months, but assume independence among the
collection of by-state time series, which is typically violated due to
similarities in their underlying economies. We construct Gaussian process and
Gaussian Markov random field alternative functional prior specifications, each
in a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions with a Dirichlet process
(DP) mixing measure over the parameters of their covariance or precision
matrices. Our DP mixture of functions models allow the data to simultaneously
estimate a dependence among the months and between states. A feature of our
models is that those functions assigned to the same cluster are drawn from a
distribution with the same covariance parameters, so that they are similar, but
don't have to be identical. We compare the performances of our two alternatives
on synthetic data and apply them to recover de-noised, by-state CPS employment

the difficulty of direct measurement of forces within tissues. Theoretical
models can help by focusing experimental studies and by providing the framework

approximation of epithelial cell mechanics based on a polygonal tiling

mechanical balance is dominated by cortical tension and ii) introduces tension
dependent local remodeling of the cortex, representing the active nature of

configurations of an ATN form a manifold with one degree of freedom per cell,
corresponding to ""isogonal"" - i.e. angle preserving - deformations of cells,

starting at fields above 8 kV/cm. This effect arises from a field-induced
reduction in THz conductivity that depends strongly on the Fermi energy. We
account for intraband absorption using a free carrier Drude model that includes
neutral and charged impurity scattering as well as optical phonon scattering.
We find that although the Fermi-level dependence in the monolayer and

involves identifying differences between two random variables without making
parametric assumptions about their underlying distributions. We refer to the
most common settings as mean difference alternatives (MDA), for testing
differences only in first moments, and general difference alternatives (GDA),
which is about testing for any difference in distributions. A large number of
test statistics have been proposed for both these settings. This paper connects
three classes of statistics - high dimensional variants of Hotelling's t-test,
statistics based on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, and energy statistics
based on pairwise distances. We ask the question: how much statistical power do
popular kernel and distance based tests for GDA have when the unknown
distributions differ in their means, compared to specialized tests for MDA?
  We formally characterize the power of popular tests for GDA like the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy with the Gaussian kernel (gMMD) and bandwidth-dependent
variants of the Energy Distance with the Euclidean norm (eED) in the
high-dimensional MDA regime. Some practically important properties include (a)
eED and gMMD have asymptotically equal power; furthermore they enjoy a free
lunch because, while they are additionally consistent for GDA, they also have
the same power as specialized high-dimensional t-test variants for MDA. All
these tests are asymptotically optimal (including matching constants) under MDA
for spherical covariances, according to simple lower bounds, (b) The power of
gMMD is independent of the kernel bandwidth, as long as it is larger than the
choice made by the median heuristic, (c) There is a clear and smooth
computation-statistics tradeoff for linear-time, subquadratic-time and

a quasi-one-dimensional wave-guide with additional harmonic trapping.
Initially, we prepare the system in its ground state and then shift the zero of
the harmonic trap and switch on an additional narrow scattering potential near
the center of the trap. After colliding with the barrier twice, we propose to
measure the number of atoms opposite to the initial condition. Quantum-enhanced
interferometry with quantum bright solitons allows us to predict detection of
an offset of the scattering potential with considerably increased precision as
compared to single-particle experiments. In a future experimental realization
this might lead to measurement of weak forces caused, for example, by small
horizontal gradients in the gravitational potential - with a resolution of
several micrometers given essentially by the size of the solitons. Our

been reported based on model calculations[H. Ishizuka and Y. Motome, Phys. Rev.

realize such an exotic state. Using first-principles calculations, we show that
the experimentally accessible Mn intercalated epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001)
transits to a Dirac half metal when the coverage is > 1/3 monolayer. This
transition results from an orbital-selective breaking of quasi-2D inversion
symmetry, leading to symmetry breaking in a single spin channel which is robust
against randomness in the distribution of Mn intercalates. Furthermore, the
inclusion of spin-orbit interaction naturally drives the system into the
quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state. Our results thus not only demonstrate the
practicality of realizing the Dirac half metal beyond a toy model but also open
up a new avenue to the realization of the QAH effect.

the industry becomes increasingly dependent on software automation tools, yet
the brittle nature of the available software automation tools limits their
effectiveness. Companies invest significantly in obtaining and implementing
automation software but most of the tools fail to deliver when the cost of
maintaining an effective automation test suite exceeds the cost and time that
would have otherwise been spent on manual testing. A failing in the current
generation of software automation tools is they do not adapt to unexpected
modifications and obstructions without frequent (and time expensive) manual
interference. Such issues are commonly acknowledged amongst industry
practitioners, yet none of the current generation of tools have leveraged the
advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to address these

  This paper proposes a framework solution that utilises machine learning
concepts, namely fuzzy matching and error recovery. The suggested solution
applies adaptive techniques to recover from unexpected obstructions that would
otherwise have prevented the script from proceeding. Recovery details are
presented to the user in a report which can be analysed to determine if the
recovery procedure was acceptable and the framework will adapt future runs

  problem",,,,,"math.DG math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the geometric Whitney problem on how a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$
can be constructed to approximate a metric space $(X,d_X)$. This problem is
closely related to manifold reconstruction where a smooth $n$-dimensional
submanifold $S\subset {\mathbb R}^m$, $m>n$ needs to be constructed to
approximate a point cloud in ${\mathbb R}^m$. These questions are encountered
in differential geometry, machine learning, and in many inverse problems
encountered in applications. The determination of a Riemannian manifold
includes the construction of its topology, differentiable structure, and
metric.
  We give constructive solutions to the above problems. Moreover, we
characterize the metric spaces that can be approximated, by Riemannian
manifolds with bounded geometry: We give sufficient conditions to ensure that a
metric space can be approximated, in the Gromov-Hausdorff or quasi-isometric
sense, by a Riemannian manifold of a fixed dimension and with bounded diameter,
sectional curvature, and injectivity radius. Also, we show that similar
conditions, with modified values of parameters, are necessary.
  As an application of the main results we give a new characterisation of
Alexandrov spaces with two-sided curvature bounds. Moreover, we characterise
the subsets of Euclidean spaces that can be approximated in the Hausdorff
metric by submanifolds of a fixed dimension and with bounded principal
curvatures and normal injectivity radius.
  We develop algorithmic procedures that solve the geometric Whitney problem
for a metric space and the manifold reconstruction problem in Euclidean space,
and estimate the computational complexity of these procedures.

lubricating fluid infused rough surfaces using hydrophobic substrates. These
surfaces show excellent slippery behaviour for water and other liquids. Here we
demonstrate a simple method to fabricate stable slippery surfaces based on
silicone oil coated hydrophilic samples. At room temperature, as prepared
samples exhibit non-slippery behaviour due to sinking of water drops inside
silicone oil layer because of inherently hydrophilic silicon substrate.
Subsequent annealing at higher temperatures provides covalent bonding of
silicone molecules at silicon surface making the surface hydrophobic which was
confirmed by lubricant wash tests. So the silicone oil coated annealed samples
show excellent water repellency, very low contact angle hysteresis and very
good slippery behavior. But these surfaces show poor oil stability against
drops flow due to cloaking of the oil around water drops which can be prevented
by using drops of larger volume or continuous flow of water.

size threshold to accomplish a successful hunt. Above this threshold,
additional individuals do not increase the probability of capturing the prey.
Recent direct observations of wolves in Yellowstone Park show that the group
size threshold when hunting its most formidable prey, bison, is nearly three
times greater than when hunting elk, a prey that is considerably less
challenging to capture than bison. These observations provide empirical support
to a computational particle model of group hunting which was previously shown
to be effective in explaining why hunting success peaks at apparently small
pack sizes when hunting elk. The model is based on considering two critical
distances between wolves and prey: the minimal safe distance at which wolves
stand from the prey, and the avoidance distance at which wolves move away from
each other when they approach the prey. The minimal safe distance is longer
when the prey is more dangerous to hunt. We show that the model explains
effectively that the group size threshold is greater when the minimal safe
distance is longer. Although both distances are longer when the prey is more
dangerous, they contribute oppositely to the value of the group size threshold:
the group size threshold is smaller when the avoidance distance is longer. This
unexpected mechanism gives rise to a global increase of the group size
threshold when considering bison with respect to elk, but other prey more
dangerous than elk can lead to specific critical distances that can give rise
to the same group size threshold. Our results show that the computational model
can guide further research on group size effects, suggesting that more
experimental observations should be obtained for other kind of prey as e.g.
moose.

pluripotent genes. Cell-cell signaling mediates the differentiation process
with robustness to noise, while epigenetic modifications affecting gene
expression dynamics fix the cellular state. These modifications ensure the
cellular state to be protected against external perturbation, but they also
work as an epigenetic barrier to recovery of pluripotency. We show that
overexpression of several genes leads to the reprogramming of cells, consistent
with the methods for establishing induced pluripotent stem cells. Our model,
which involves the inter-relationship between gene expression dynamics and
epigenetic modifications, improves our basic understanding of cell
differentiation and reprogramming.

rational function field of an $n\times n$ matrix $T$ with integral homogeneous
linear polynomials. In this paper, we consider the non-commutative version of
Edmonds' problem: compute the rank of $T$ over the free skew field. It is known
that this problem relates to the ring of matrix semi-invariants. In particular,
if the nullcone of matrix semi-invariants is defined by elements of degree
$\leq \sigma$, then there follows a $\mathrm{poly}(n, \sigma)$-time randomized
algorithm to decide whether the non-commutative rank of $T$ is $<n$. To our
knowledge, previously the best bound for $\sigma$ was $O(n^2\cdot 4^{n^2})$
over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$ (Derksen, 2001).
  In this article we prove the following results:
  (1) We observe that by using an algorithm of Gurvits, and assuming the above
bound $\sigma$ for $R(n, m)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, deciding whether $T$ has
non-commutative rank $<n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ can be done deterministically in
time polynomial in the input size and $\sigma$.
  (2) When $\mathbb{F}$ is large enough, we devise a deterministic algorithm
for non-commutative Edmonds' problem in time polynomial in $(n+1)!$, with the
following consequences.
  (2.a) If the commutative rank and the non-commutative rank of $T$ differ by a
constant, then there exists a randomized efficient algorithm that computes the
non-commutative rank of $T$.
  (2.b) We prove that $\sigma\leq (n+1)!$. This not only improves the bound
obtained from Derksen's work over algebraically closed field of characteristic
$0$ but, more importantly, also provides for the first time an explicit bound
on $\sigma$ for matrix semi-invariants over fields of positive characteristics.

viable solution where all distributed transmitters seek to align in phase at

about the possibility of inverting the dynamics of a dispersive shock wave and
turn it into a regular wave-front. Nevertheless, the opposite scenario, i.e., a
smooth wave generating turbulent dynamics is well studied and observed in
experiments. Here we introduce a new theoretical formulation for the dynamics
in a highly nonlocal and defocusing medium described by the nonlinear
Schroedinger equation. Our theory unveils a mechanism that enhances the degree
of irreversibility. This mechanism explains why a dispersive shock cannot be
reversed in evolution even for an arbitrarirly small amount of loss. Our theory
is based on the concept of nonlinear Gamow vectors, i.e., power dependent
generalizations of the counter-intuitive and hereto elusive exponentially
decaying states in Hamiltonian systems. We theoretically show that nonlinear
Gamow vectors play a fundamental role in nonlinear Schroedinger models: they
may be used as a generalized basis for describing the dynamics of the shock
waves, and affect the degree of irreversibility of wave-breaking phenomena.
Gamow vectors allow to analytically calculate the amount of breaking of
time-reversal with a quantitative agreement with numerical solutions. We also
show that a nonlocal nonlinear optical medium may act as a simulator for the
experimental investigation of quantum irreversible models, as the reversed

burstiness of event sequences to correlations between timings of node and link
activations. In this paper, we set to explore the latter by using greedy walks
as probes of temporal network structure. Given a temporal network (a sequence
of contacts), greedy walks proceed from node to node by always following the
first available contact. Because of this, their structure is particularly
sensitive to temporal-topological patterns involving repeated contacts between
sets of nodes. This becomes evident in their small coverage per step as
compared to a temporal reference model -- in empirical temporal networks,
greedy walks often get stuck within small sets of nodes because of correlated
contact patterns. While this may also happen in static networks that have
pronounced community structure, the use of the temporal reference model takes
the underlying static network structure out of the equation and indicates that
there is a purely temporal reason for the observations. Further analysis of the
structure of greedy walks indicates that burst trains, sequences of repeated
contacts between node pairs, are the dominant factor. However, there are larger
patterns too, as shown with non-backtracking greedy walks. We proceed further
to study the entropy rates of greedy walks, and show that the sequences of
visited nodes are more structured and predictable in original data as compared
to temporally uncorrelated references. Taken together, these results indicate a
richness of correlated temporal-topological patterns in temporal networks.

enrich our Universe has triggered a new era in nuclear physics studies.\ Of all
the relevant nuclear physics inputs, the mass of very neutron-rich nuclides is
a key quantity for revealing the origin of heavy elements beyond iron.\
Although the precise determination of this property is a great challenge,
enormous progress has been made in recent decades, and it has contributed
significantly to both nuclear structure and astrophysical nucleosynthesis
studies.\ In this review, we first survey our present knowledge of the nuclear
mass surface, emphasizing the importance of nuclear mass precision in
$r$-process calculations.\ We then discuss recent progress in various methods
of nuclear mass measurement with a few selected examples.\ For each method, we
focus on recent breakthroughs and discuss possible ways of improving the
weighing of $r$-process nuclides.

has very strong silicate emission at 10 $\mu$m but negligible far-IR and UV
emission. This makes it a candidate for a bare AGN source in the IR, perhaps
seen pole-on, without significant IR emission from the host galaxy. In this
paper we present optical spectra taken with the Southern African Large

its AGN. We find broad H$\alpha$ emission characteristic of an AGN, plus
absorption lines associated with a mature stellar population ($>9$ Gyr), and
refine its redshift determination to $z=0.1428\pm0.0001$. There is no evidence
for any emission lines associated with star formation. This remarkable object
exemplifies the need for separating the emission from any AGN from that of the
host galaxy when employing infrared diagnostic diagrams. We estimate the black
hole mass, $M_{\rm BH}=3.5\pm0.8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$, host galaxy mass,
$M_{\rm stars}=2.5^{2.5}_{1.2}\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, and accretion
luminosity, $L_{\rm bol}({\rm AGN})=5.3\pm0.4\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$

prominent than expected for a host galaxy of this modest size. The old age is
in tension with the downsizing paradigm in which this galaxy would recently
have transformed from a star-forming disc galaxy into an early-type, passively
evolving galaxy.

matching. In the k-mismatch problem we must compute the Hamming distance
between a pattern of length m and every m-length substring of a text of length
n, as long as that Hamming distance is at most k. Where the Hamming distance is
greater than k at some alignment of the pattern and text, we simply output
""No"".
  We study this problem in both the standard offline setting and also as a
streaming problem. In the streaming k-mismatch problem the text arrives one
symbol at a time and we must give an output before processing any future
symbols. Our main results are as follows:
  1) Our first result is a deterministic $O(n k^2\log{k} / m+n \text{polylog}
m)$ time offline algorithm for k-mismatch on a text of length n. This is a
factor of k improvement over the fastest previous result of this form from SODA
2000 by Amihood Amir et al.
  2) We then give a randomised and online algorithm which runs in the same time
complexity but requires only $O(k^2\text{polylog} {m})$ space in total.
  3) Next we give a randomised $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the
streaming k-mismatch problem which uses $O(k^2\text{polylog} m / \epsilon^2)$
space and runs in $O(\text{polylog} m / \epsilon^2)$ worst-case time per
arriving symbol.
  4) Finally we combine our new results to derive a randomised
$O(k^2\text{polylog} {m})$ space algorithm for the streaming k-mismatch problem
which runs in $O(\sqrt{k}\log{k} + \text{polylog} {m})$ worst-case time per
arriving symbol. This improves the best previous space complexity for streaming
k-mismatch from FOCS 2009 by Benny Porat and Ely Porat by a factor of k. We
also improve the time complexity of this previous result by an even greater
factor to match the fastest known offline algorithm (up to logarithmic
factors).

the radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia, an absorption of the RF photon by the
Fermi electron occurs with involvement of the longitudinal acoustic vibrational
mode (LAVM), the dominating one in the distribution of vibrational density of
states (VDOS). This physical mechanism helps to explain two observed phenomena:
the size dependence of the heating rate (HR) in GNPs and reduced heat
production in aggregated GNPs. The argumentation proceeds within the
one-electron approximation, taking into account the discretenesses of energies
and momenta of both electrons and LAVMs. The heating of GNPs is thought to
consist of two consecutive processes: first, the Fermi electron absorbs
simultaneously the RF photon and the LAVM available in the GNP; hereafter the
excited electron gets relaxed within the GNP's boundary, exciting a LAVM with
the energy higher than that of the previously absorbed LAVM. GNPs containing
the Ta and/or Fe impurities are proposed for the RF hyperthermia as promising
heaters with enhanced HRs, and GNPs with rare-earth impurity atoms are also
brought into consideration. It is shown why the maximum HR values should be
expected in GNPs with about 5-7 nm size.

the STO NPs were much better resolved in UFM than in contact-mode AFM
topography. For high STO concentrations the individual STO NPs formed
nanoclusters, which gathered in microaggregates. The STO aggregates, covered by
PVA, exhibited no AFM frictional contrast, but were clearly distinguished from
the PVA matrix using UFM. Similar aggregation was observed for NPs in the
composite samples than for NPs deposited on top of a flat silicon substrate
from a milliQ water solution in the absence of polymer. In the hybrid films,
most STO nanoparticles typically presented a lower UFM contrast than the PVA
matrix, even though stiffer sample regions such as STO should give rise to a
higher UFM contrast. STO NPs with intermediate contrast were characterized by
an UFM halo of lower contrast at the PVA/STO interface. The results may be
explained by considering that ultrasound is effectively damped on the nanometer
scale at PVA/ STO interfaces. According to our data, the nanoscale ultrasonic

represented by the ascending manifold geometry of the 2-saddles in the
Morse-Smale complex of the density field. We generate a hierarchy of
Morse-Smale complexes and query for filaments based on the density ranges at
the end points of the filaments. The query is processed efficiently over the
entire hierarchical Morse-Smale complex, allowing for interactive
visualization.
  We apply Felix to computer simulations based on the heuristic Voronoi
kinematic model and the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and demonstrate its
usefulness through two case studies. First, we extract cosmic filaments within
and across cluster like regions in Voronoi kinematic simulation datasets. We
demonstrate that we produce similar results to existing structure finders.
Filaments that form the spine of the cosmic web, which exist in high density
regions in the current epoch, are isolated using Felix. Also, filaments present
in void-like regions are isolated and visualized. These filamentary structures
are often over shadowed by higher density range filaments and are not easily
characterizable and extractable using other filament extraction methodologies.

form a new population of near Earth objects presenting many advantages toward
that goal. Prior to the mission, we consider the spacecraft hibernating on a
Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon's $L_2$ libration point. The objective is to
design a transfer for the spacecraft from the parking orbit to rendezvous with
\RH while minimizing the fuel consumption. Our transfers use indirect methods,
based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, combined with continuation

accomplished with low delta-v. This exploratory work can be seen as a first
step to identify good candidates for a rendezvous on a given TCO trajectory.

functions of nuclei in the valley of stability. For the photon strength in the
isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR) regime a parameterization of GDR
shapes by the sum of three Lorentzians (TLO) is extrapolated to energies below
and above the IVGDR. The impact of non-GDR modes adding to the low energy slope
of photon strength is discussed including recent data on photon scattering and
other radiative processes. These are shown to be concentrated in energy regions
where various model calculations predict intermediate collective strength; thus
they are obviously separate from the IVGDR tail. The triple Lorentzian (TLO)
ansatz for giant dipole resonances is normalized in accordance to the dipole
sum rule. The nuclear droplet model with surface dissipation accounts well for
positions and widths without local, nuclide specific, parameters. Very few and
only global parameters are needed when a breaking of axial symmetry already in
the valley of stability is admitted and hence a reliable prediction for
electric dipole strength functions also outside of it is expected.

This
description is necessary for a detailed analysis of spin dynamics in
electric-dipole-moment experiments in storage rings. General formulas
describing a behavior of all components of the polarization vector at the
magnetic resonance are obtained for an arbitrary initial polarization. These
formulas are exact on condition that the nonresonance rotating field is
neglected. The spin dynamics is also calculated at frequencies far from
resonance with allowance for both rotating fields. A general quantum-mechanical
analysis of the spin evolution at the magnetic resonance is fulfilled and the
full agreement between the classical and quantum-mechanical approaches is
shown. Quasimagnetic resonances for particles and nuclei moving in
noncontinuous perturbing fields of accelerators and storage rings are
considered. Distinguishing features of quasimagnetic resonances in storage ring
electric-dipole-moment experiments are investigated in detail. The exact
formulas for the effect caused by the electric dipole moment are derived. The
difference between the resonance effects conditioned by the rf electric-field
flipper and the rf Wien filter is found and is calculated for the first time.
The existence of this difference is crucial for the establishment of a consent
between analytical derivations and computer simulations and for checking spin
tracking programs. Main systematical errors are considered.

a tumor. The goal of this study is to develop an algorithmic solution for
predicting the position of a target in 3D in real time, aiming for the short
fixed calibration time for each patient at the beginning of the procedure.
Accurate predictions of lung tumor motion are expected to improve the precision
of radiation treatment by controlling the position of a couch or a beam in
order to compensate for respiratory motion during radiation treatment.
  Methods. For developing the algorithmic solution, data mining techniques are
used. A model form from the family of exponential smoothing is assumed, and the
model parameters are fitted by minimizing the absolute disposition error, and
the fluctuations of the prediction signal (jitter). The predictive performance
is evaluated retrospectively on clinical datasets capturing different behavior
(being quiet, talking, laughing), and validated in real-time on a prototype
system with respiratory motion imitation.
  Results. An algorithmic solution for respiratory motion prediction (called
ExSmi) is designed. ExSmi achieves good accuracy of prediction (error $4-9$
mm/s) with acceptable jitter values (5-7 mm/s), as tested on out-of-sample
data. The datasets, the code for algorithms and the experiments are openly
available for research purposes on a dedicated website.
  Conclusions. The developed algorithmic solution performs well to be
prototyped and deployed in applications of radiotherapy.

the many controversies of magnetic field detections obtained with the FORS
instruments, we derived the magnetic field values with two completely
independent reduction and analysis pipelines. We compare and discuss the
results obtained from the two pipelines. We obtained a general good agreement,
indicating that most of the discrepancies on magnetic field detections reported
in the literature are caused by the interpretation of the significance of the
results (i.e., 3-4 sigma detections considered as genuine, or not), instead of
by significant differences in the derived magnetic field values. By combining
our results with past FORS1 measurements of HD46328, we improve the estimate of
the stellar rotation period, obtaining P = 2.17950+/-0.00009 days. For
HD125823, our FORS2 measurements do not fit the available magnetic field model,
based on magnetic field values obtained 30 years ago. We repeatedly detect a
magnetic field for the O9.7V star HD54879, the HD164492C massive binary, and
the He-rich star CPD -57 3509. We obtain a magnetic field detection rate of
6+/-4%, while by considering only the apparently slow rotators we derive a
detection rate of 8+/-5%, both comparable with what was previously reported by
other similar surveys. We are left with the intriguing result that, although
the large majority of magnetic massive stars is rotating slowly, our detection
rate is not a strong function of the stellar rotational velocity.

Evidence of hyperfine breakdown comes from three observations, namely a
nonlinear dependence of the transition frequencies on the trap intensity, a
splitting of lines which are degenerate for small intensities, and the ability
to drive transitions which would be forbidden by selection rules in the absence
of hyperfine breakdown. From the data, we infer the hyperfine interval of the

of Fermi liquids in metals, heavy fermions, etc. Here we prove that the phases
of many-body interacting multi-component quantum liquids in one dimension (1D)
can be described by WRs based on the compressibility, susceptibility and
specific heat associated with each component. These WRs arise due to additivity
rules within subsystems reminiscent of the rules for multi-resistor networks in

Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) independent of microscopic details of the

examples, we prove that the Wilson ratios uniquely identify phases of TLL,
while providing universal scaling relations at the boundaries between phases.
Their values within a phase are solely determined by the stiffnesses and sound
velocities of subsystems and identify the internal degrees of freedom of said
phase such as its spin-degeneracy. This finding can be directly applied to a
wide range of 1D many-body systems and reveals deep physical insights into

in the reconstruction of semiclassical bulk gravity. We consider the
entanglement entropy of spherical regions of vacuum, which is known to contain
universal contributions. After perturbing the CFT with a relevant scalar
operator, also the first order change of this quantity gives a universal term
which only depends on a discrete set of basic CFT parameters. We show that in
gravity this statement corresponds to the uniqueness of the ghost-free graviton
propagator on an AdS background geometry. While the gravitational dynamics in
this context contains little information about the structure of the bulk
theory, there is a discrete set of dimensionless parameters of the theory which
determines the entanglement entropy. We argue that for every (not necessarily
holographic) CFT, any reasonable gravity model can be used to compute this
particular entanglement entropy. We elucidate how this statement is consistent
with AdS/CFT and also give various generalizations. On the one hand this
illustrates the remarkable usefulness of geometric concepts for understanding
entanglement in general CFTs. On the other hand, it provides hints as to what
entanglement data can be expected to provide enough information to distinguish,
e.g., bulk theories with different higher curvature couplings.

protoplanetary disc evolution. Using 3D radiative hydrodynamics, we have
modelled the physical and chemical evolution of a 0.17 M$_{\odot}$
self-gravitating disc over a period of 2000 yr. The 0.8 M$_{\odot}$ central
protostar is likely to evolve into a solar-like star, and hence this Class 0 or
early Class I young stellar object may be analogous to our early Solar System.
Shocks driven by gravitational instabilities enhance the desorption rates,
which dominate the changes in gas-phase fractional abundances for most species.
We find that at the end of the simulation, a number of species distinctly trace
the spiral structure of our relatively low-mass disc, particularly CN. We
compare our simulation to that of a more massive disc, and conclude that mass
differences between gravitationally unstable discs may not have a strong impact
on the chemical composition. We find that over the duration of our simulation,
successive shock heating has a permanent effect on the abundances of HNO, CN
and NH$_3$, which may have significant implications for both simulations and
observations. We also find that HCO$^+$ may be a useful tracer of disc mass. We
conclude that gravitational instabilities induced in lower mass discs can
significantly, and permanently, affect the chemical evolution, and that
observations with high-resolution instruments such as ALMA offer a promising
means of characterising gravitational instabilities in protosolar discs.

part of a blind survey of unidentified Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources
being carried out on the volunteer distributed computing system, Einstein@Home.
This newly discovered pulsar previously appeared as the most significant
remaining unidentified gamma-ray source without a known association in the
second Fermi-LAT source catalog (2FGL) and was among the top ten most
significant unassociated sources in the recent third catalog (3FGL). PSR
J1906+0722 is a young, energetic, isolated pulsar, with a spin frequency of
$8.9$ Hz, a characteristic age of $49$ kyr, and spin-down power $1.0 \times
10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In 2009 August it suffered one of the largest glitches
detected from a gamma-ray pulsar ($\Delta f / f \approx 4.5\times10^{-6}$).
Remaining undetected in dedicated radio follow-up observations, the pulsar is
likely radio-quiet. An off-pulse analysis of the gamma-ray flux from the
location of PSR J1906+0722 revealed the presence of an additional nearby
source, which may be emission from the interaction between a neighboring
supernova remnant and a molecular cloud. We discuss possible effects which may
have hindered the detection of PSR J1906+0722 in previous searches and describe
the methods by which these effects were mitigated in this survey. We also
demonstrate the use of advanced timing methods for estimating the positional,
spin and glitch parameters of difficult-to-time pulsars such as this.

potentials. We first consider the NS fluxes, and point out that the
`non-geometric' $R$ flux is dual to a mixed-symmetry potential with a set of
nine antisymmetric indices. We then consider the T-duality family of fluxes
whose prototype is the Scherk-Schwarz reduction of the S-dual of the RR scalar
of IIB supergravity. Using the relation with mixed-symmetry potentials, we are
able to give a complete classification of these fluxes, including the ones that
are non-geometric. The non-geometric fluxes again turn out to be dual to
potentials containing nine antisymmetric indices. Our analysis suggests that
all these fluxes can be understood in the context of double field theory,
although for the non-geometric ones one expects a violation of the strong
constraint.

elements imposes to work in the basis where the helicity is diagonal which is
also needed to attain the massless limit. We show that the kinematic Thomas
precession correction can be studied straightforwardly within this approach. It
contributes on an equal footing with the Berry gauge fields. In fact in
equations of motion it eliminates the terms arising from the Berry gauge

attracting large interest. Indeed, a generalization of the Hong-Ou-Mandel
effect valid for any number of photons and optical modes would represent an
important leap ahead both from a fundamental perspective and for practical
applications, such as certification of photonic quantum devices, whose
computational speedup is expected to depend critically on multiparticle
interference. Quantum distinctive features have been predicted for many
particles injected into multimode interferometers implementing the Fourier
transformation in the Fock space. In this work we develop a scalable approach
for the implementation of quantum fast Fourier transform using 3-D photonic
integrated interferometers, fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique.
We observe the quantum suppression of a large number of output states with 4-
and 8-mode optical circuits: the experimental results demonstrate genuine
quantum interference between the injected photons, thus offering a powerful
tool for diagnostic of photonic platforms.

in the optimal filter over a deterministic state space grid and is developed
from samples of the current state obtained by solving the state equation
implicitly. The purpose of the meshfree approximation is to improve the
efficiency of the implicit filter in moderately high-dimensional problems. The
construction of the algorithm includes generation of random state space points

threats such as advertising spam, online stalking and identity theft. Although
many users hide or do not fill out their private attributes in OSNs, prior
studies point out that the hidden attributes may be inferred from some other
public information. Thus, users' private information could still be at stake to
be exposed. Hitherto, little work helps users to assess the exposure
probability/risk that the hidden attributes can be correctly predicted, let
alone provides them with pointed countermeasures. In this article, we focus our
study on the exposure risk assessment by a particular privacy-sensitive
attribute - current city - in Facebook. Specifically, we first design a novel
current city prediction approach that discloses users' hidden `current city'
from their self-exposed information. Based on 371,913 Facebook users' data, we
verify that our proposed prediction approach can predict users' current city
more accurately than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we inspect the
prediction results and model the current city exposure probability via some
measurable characteristics of the self-exposed information. Finally, we
construct an exposure estimator to assess the current city exposure risk for
individual users, given their self-exposed information. Several case studies
are presented to illustrate how to use our proposed estimator for privacy
protection.

of this article is devoted to the superfluid $^3$He, which serves as a rich
repository of novel topological quantum phenomena originating from the
intertwining of symmetries and topologies. In particular, it is emphasized that
the quantum fluid confined to nanofabricated geometries possesses multiple
superfluid phases composed of the symmetry-protected topological superfluid
B-phase, the A-phase as a Weyl superfluid, the nodal planar and polar phases,
and the crystalline ordered stripe phase. All these phases generate noteworthy
topological phenomena, including topological phase transitions concomitant with
spontaneous symmetry breaking, Majorana fermions, Weyl superfluidity, emergent
supersymmetry, spontaneous edge mass and spin currents, topological Fermi arcs,
and exotic quasiparticles bound to topological defects. In relation to the mass
current carried by gapless edge states, we also briefly review a longstanding
issue on the intrinsic angular momentum paradox in $^3$He-A. Moreover, we share
the current status of our knowledge on the topological aspects of
unconventional superconductors, such as the heavy-fermion superconductor

represents the ratio of the $B_s^0$ to $B^0$ production cross-sections, and the
$B^0 \to \phi K^*(892)^0$ decay mode is used for normalization. This is the
most precise measurement of this branching fraction to date, representing a
factor five reduction in the statistical uncertainty compared with the previous
best measurement. A search for the decay $B^0 \to \phi \phi$ is also made. No
signal is observed, and an upper limit on the branching fraction is set as \[
\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to \phi \phi) < 2.8 \times 10^{-8} \] at 90% confidence level.
This is a factor of seven improvement compared to the previous best limit.

chains below the structural phase transition occuring at $T_{\rm{s1}}=61$~K on
cooling. Here we report a detailed X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
study of this phase in CsO$_2$ powder. The EPR signal appears as a broad line
below $T_{\rm{s1}}$, which is replaced by the antiferromagnetic resonance below
the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}=8.3$~K. The temperature dependence of the
EPR linewidth between $T_{\rm{s1}}$ and $T_{\rm{N}}$ agrees with the
predictions for the one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain of
$S=1/2$ spins in the presence of symmetric anisotropic exchange interaction.
Complementary analysis of the EPR lineshape, linewidth and the signal intensity
within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework allows for a determination
of the TLL exponent $K=0.48$. Present EPR data thus fully comply with the
quantum antiferromagnetic state of spin-1/2 chains in the orbitally ordered
phase of CsO$_2$, which is, therefore, a unique $p-$orbital system where such a
state could be studied.

consistent and parsimonious model selection procedure. At the same time it
resolves the conceptual and computational problems due to the use of imaginary
data. Namely, (i) it dispenses with the need to select and average across all
possible minimal imaginary samples, and (ii) it diminishes the effect that the
imaginary data have upon the posterior distribution. These attributes allow for
large sample approximations, when needed, in order to reduce the computational
burden under more complex models. In this work we generalize the applicability
of the PEP methodology, focusing on the framework of generalized linear models
(GLMs), by introducing two new PEP definitions which are in effect applicable
to any general model setting. Hyper-prior extensions for the power parameter
that regulates the contribution of the imaginary data are introduced. We
further study the validity of the predictive matching and of the model
selection consistency, providing analytical proofs for the former and empirical
evidence supporting the latter. For estimation of posterior model and inclusion
probabilities we introduce a tuning-free Gibbs-based variable selection
sampler. Several simulation scenarios and one real life example are considered

invariant rather than a local imbalance between constraints and degrees of

such topological states. We also demonstrate how to generalize these

a domain wall between two topologically distinct, mechanically rigid structures

(SpT=B9V), located at a distance of 440(+60-50) pc, with a mass accretion rate
of ~9+/-3x10^(-7) M_sun yr^(-1). SINFONI K-band AO-assisted imaging shows a
spatially resolved circumstellar disc-like region (~140 AU in diameter) with
asymmetric brightness distribution. Our AMBER/VLTI UT observations indicate
that the Br$\gamma$ emitting region (radius ~0.31+/-0.04 AU) is smaller than
the continuum emitting region (inner dust radius ~0.7+/-0.2 AU), showing
significant non-zero V-shaped differential phases (i.e. non S-shaped, as
expected for a rotating disc). The value of the continuum-corrected pure
Br$\gamma$ line visibility at the longest baseline (89 m) is ~0.8+/-0.1, i.e.
the Br$\gamma$ emitting region is partially resolved. Our modelling suggests
that the observed Br$\gamma$ line-emitting region mainly originates from a disc
wind with a half opening angle of 30deg, and with a mass-loss rate of ~2x10(-7)
M_sun yr^(-1). The observed V-shaped differential phases are reliably
reproduced by combining a simple asymmetric continuum disc model with our
Br$\gamma$ disc-wind model. The Br$\gamma$ emission of HD 98922 can be modelled
with a disc wind that is able to approximately reproduce all interferometric
observations if we assume that the intensity distribution of the dust continuum
disc is asymmetric.

  with changes to atomic structure by thermal annealing","22 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2016.02.005",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Amorphous tantala (a-Ta2O5) is an important technological material that has
wide ranging applications in electronics, optics and the biomedical industry.
It is used as the high refractive index layers in the multi-layer dielectric
mirror coatings in the latest generation of gravitational wave interferometers,
as well as other precision interferometers. One of the current limitations in
sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is Brownian thermal noise that
arises from the tantala mirror coatings. Measurements have shown differences in
mechanical loss of the mirror coatings, which is directly related to Brownian
thermal noise, in response to thermal annealing. We utilise scanning electron
diffraction to perform Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) on Ion Beam
Sputtered (IBS) amorphous tantala coatings, definitively showing an increase in
the medium range order (MRO), as determined from the variance between the
diffraction patterns in the scan, due to thermal annealing at increasing
temperatures. Moreover, we employ Virtual Dark-Field Imaging (VDFi) to
spatially resolve the FEM signal, enabling investigation of the persistence of
the fragments responsible for the medium range order, as well as the extent of
the ordering over nm length scales, and show ordered patches larger than 5 nm
in the highest temperature annealed sample. These structural changes directly
correlate with the observed changes in mechanical loss.

predicting protein structures. In this study, we developed a statistical
potential function, called OPUS-Beta, for energetically evaluating beta-sheet
contact pattern (the entire residue-residue beta-contacts of a protein)
independent of the atomic coordinate information. The OPUS-Beta potential
contains five terms, i.e., a self-packing term, a pairwise inter-strand packing
term, a pairwise intra-strand packing term, a lattice term and a
hydrogen-bonding term. The results show that, in recognizing the native
beta-contact pattern from decoys, OPUS-Beta potential outperforms the existing
methods in literature, especially in combination with a method using
2D-recursive neural networks (about 5% and 23% improvements in top-1 and top-5
selections). We expect OPUS-Beta potential to be useful in beta-sheet modeling
for proteins.

and turbulent statistics show excellent quantitative agreement. The molecular
scale law of the wall is presented in which stick-slip molecular wall-fluid
interactions replace the no-slip conditions. The impact of grid resolution is
explored and the observed structures are seen to be dependant on averaging time
and length scales. The kinetic energy spectra show a range of scales are

grid resolution employed. The subgrid velocity of the molecules is compared to
spatial averaged velocity using joint probability density functions. Molecular

(MIMO) broadcast channels in which a base transceiver station (BTS) broadcasts
multiple data streams to K MIMO mobile stations (MSs) simultaneously. In order
to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the system subject to the
transmitted power constraint, the design problem is to find the pre-coding
matrices at BTS and the decoding matrices at MSs. However, such a design
problem is typically a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization and, thus, it is
quite hard to obtain the analytical solutions. To tackle with the mathematical
difficulties, we propose an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm to
optimize the transceiver matrices. Specifically, we utilize the linear minimum
mean square error (MMSE) Wiener filters at MSs. Then, we introduce the
constrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to jointly optimize the
precoding and decoding matrices. Numerical experiments are exhibited to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence,
computational complexity and total WSR.

multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of an
eavesdropper as a rank constrained rank minimization (RCRM) problem. The aim of
the proposed rank minimization IA schemes is to find the precoding and receiver
subspace matrices to align interference and wiretapped signals into the lowest
dimension subspaces while keeping the desired signal subspace spanning full
available spatial dimensions. To deal with the nonconvexity of the rank
function, we present two convex relaxations of the RCRM problem, namely nuclear
norm (NN) and reweighted nuclear norm (RNN), and transform the rank constraints
to equivalent and tractable ones. We then derive a coordinate decent approach
to obtain the solutions for IA schemes. The simulation results show that our
proposed IA designs outperform the conventional IA design in terms of average
secrecy sum rate. On the other hand, our proposed designs perform the same or
better than other secure IA schemes which account for low interference and
wiretapped signal power rather than for low dimensions of interference and
wiretapped signal matrices in the systems which achieve the perfect IA.

surface process that results in a random geometry of clusters of homogenous
short DNA fragments typically hundreds of base pairs long - bridge
amplification. The statistical properties of this random process and length of
the fragments are critical as they affect the information that can be
subsequently extracted, i.e., density of successfully inferred DNA fragment
reads. The ensemble of overlapping DNA fragment reads are then used to
computationally reconstruct the much longer target genome sequence, e.g,
ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of base pairs. The success of
the reconstruction in turn depends on having a sufficiently large ensemble of
DNA fragments that are sufficiently long. In this paper using stochastic
geometry we model and optimize the end-to-end process linking and partially
controlling the statistics of the physical processes to the success of the
computational step. This provides, for the first time, a framework capturing
salient features of such sequencing platforms that can be used to study cost,
performance or sensitivity of the sequencing process.

describe the method of event coincidence analysis to provide a framework for
quantifying the strength, directionality and time lag of statistical
interrelationships between event series. Event coincidence analysis allows to
formulate and test null hypotheses on the origin of the observed
interrelationships including tests based on Poisson processes or, more
generally, stochastic point processes with a prescribed inter-event time
distribution and other higher-order properties. Applying the framework to
country-level observational data yields evidence that flood events have acted
as triggers of epidemic outbreaks globally since the 1950s. Facing projected
future changes in the statistics of climatic extreme events, statistical
techniques such as event coincidence analysis will be relevant for
investigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human societies
