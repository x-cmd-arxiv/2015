especially in unknown dynamic environments. However, most multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as
exponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes
it difficult to scale up to realistic multi-agent problems. In this paper, a
novel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI)
is presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction based MARL
algorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for
agents to select the non-strict Equilibrium Dominating Strategy Profile
(non-strict EDSP) or Meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented
NegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for
sparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum
variance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of
local Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared
value functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to
achieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational
complexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI
algorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria:
steps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime
(AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games
and shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm.
Then in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent
warehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
presented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL
algorithms.

ecology. In many instances, processes involving chemical attraction take place
in fluids. One of the most studied PDE models of chemotaxis is given by
Keller-Segel equation, which describes a population density of bacteria or mold
which attract chemically to substance they secrete. Solution of Keller-Segel
equation can exhibit dramatic collapsing behavior, where the density
concentrates positive mass in a measure zero region. A natural question is
whether presence of fluid flow can affect singularity formation by mixing the
density thus making concentration harder to achieve.
  In this paper, we consider parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel equation in two
and three dimensions with additional advection term modeling ambient fluid
flow. We prove that for any initial data, there exist incompressible fluid
flows such that the solution to the equation stays globally regular. On the
other hand, it is well known that when the fluid flow is absent, there exist
initial data leading to finite time blow up. Thus presence of fluid can prevent
the singularity formation.
  We discuss two classes of flows that have the explosion arresting property.
Both classes are known as very efficient mixers. The first class are relaxation
enhancing (RE) flow. These flows are stationary. The second class of flows are
Yao-Zlatos optimal mixing flows, which are time dependent. The proof is based
on the nonlinear version of the relaxation enhancement construction of the
paper by Peter Constantin, Alexander Kiselev, Lenya Ryzhik, Andrej Zlatos, and
on some variations of global regularity estimate for Keller-Segel model.

physics, and a suitable arena to study high-energy physics at the early
universe including inflation, whose observational evidences are growing more
and more. Inflation in supergravity, however, cannot be easily described
because of restrictions from supersymmetry (SUSY). The scalar potential has an
exponential factor and a large negative term whereas a flat and positive
potential is needed to realize inflation. The standard method to obtain such an
inflationary scalar potential requires an additional superfield to the one
containing inflaton. In this thesis, we propose and develop an alternative
method which does not require the additional superfield and thus reduces the
necessary degrees of freedom by half. That is, we study inflation in
supergravity with only a single chiral superfield which contains inflaton. We
accomplish it by introducing a higher dimensional term in the inflaton Kahler
potential, which plays an important dual role: fixing the value of the scalar
superpartner of the inflaton resulting in effective single field models, and
ensuring the positivity of the inflaton potential at the large field region.
Our proposal is not just particular models but rather a new framework to
realize various inflationary models in supergravity. In particular, large field
inflation in supergravity using one superfield without tuning has become
possible for the first time. In our generic models, SUSY breaking at the
inflationary scale by inflaton is not completely restored after inflation, so
null results for SUSY search at the LHC are predicted for the simplest cases.
Remarkably, however, it is possible with tuning to embed arbitrary positive
semidefinite scalar potentials into supergravity preserving SUSY at the vacuum.
Our discovery opens up an entirely new branch of model building of inflation in
supergravity.

population of sources (binary components with masses
$1.2~\mathrm{M}_\odot$--$1.6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and spins of less than $0.05$)
using the full LIGO analysis pipeline. While this simulated population covers
the observed range of potential binary neutron-star sources, we do not exclude
the possibility of sources with parameters outside these ranges; given the
existing uncertainty in distributions of mass and spin, it is critical that
analyses account for the full range of possible mass and spin configurations.
We find that conservative prior assumptions on neutron-star mass and spin lead
to average fractional uncertainties in component masses of $\sim 16\%$, with
little constraint on spins (the median $90\%$ upper limit on the spin of the
more massive component is $\sim 0.7$). Stronger prior constraints on
neutron-star spins can further constrain mass estimates, but only marginally.
However, we find that the sky position and luminosity distance for these
sources are not influenced by the inclusion of spin; therefore, if LIGO detects
a low-spin population of BNS sources, less computationally expensive results
calculated neglecting spin will be sufficient for guiding electromagnetic
follow-up.

Lorentz invariance at energy scales much below $M$. We show that a quantum
field with this dispersion predicts drastic low energy Lorentz violation in
atoms modelled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors, for any $f$ that dips below unity
somewhere. As an example, we show that polymer quantization motivated by loop
quantum gravity predicts such Lorentz violation below current ion collider
rapidities.

of gravity with a finite number of degrees of freedom requires that Coleman-De
Luccia tunneling rates to vacua with negative cosmological constant should be
interpreted as recurrences to low-entropy states. This demand translates into
two constraints, or consistency conditions, on the scalar potential which are
generically: 1) the distance in field space between the de Sitter vacuum and
any other vacuum with negative cosmological constant must be of the order of
the reduced Planck mass or larger and 2) the fourth root of the vacuum energy
density of the de Sitter vacuum must be smaller than the fourth root of the
typical scale of the scalar potential. These consistency conditions shed a
different light on both outstanding hierarchy problems of the Standard Model of
particle physics: the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and the scale of
the cosmological constant. Beyond the unconventional interpretation of quantum
de Sitter space, we complete the analytic understanding of the thin-wall
approximation of Coleman-De Luccia tunneling, extend its numerical analysis to
generic potentials and discuss the role of gravity in stabilizing the Standard
Model potential.

communications, applications in the regime of large spatiotemporal scale
communication requirements are better supported by cellular communications, and
applications in the regime of small spatial scale but medium-to-large temporal

which only moves when the limit of the null-recurrent fast motion equals zero.
The set of these times forms a zero-measure Cantor set and therefore the

process by its infinitesimal generator (with appropriate boundary conditions)
and we also characterize the process as the weak solution of an SDE that
depends on the local time of the fast motion process. We also investigate the
long time behavior of such a system when the unperturbed motion is trivial. In
this case, we show that the long-time limit is constant on a set of full
Lebesgue measure with probability 1, but it has nontrivial drift and diffusion

services that are data marketplaces have emerged that match data buyers with

Koutris et al and ask the question of computing optimal input prices in this
framework by formulating a buyer utility model.
  We establish the interesting and deep equivalence between arbitrage-freeness
in the query-pricing framework and envy-freeness in pricing theory for
appropriately chosen buyer valuations. Given the approximation hardness results
from envy-free pricing we then develop logarithmic approximation pricing
algorithms exploiting the max flow interpretation of the arbitrage-free pricing
for the restricted query language proposed by Koutris et al. We propose a novel
polynomial-time logarithmic approximation pricing scheme and show that our new
scheme performs better than the existing envy-free pricing algorithms
instance-by-instance. We also present a faster pricing algorithm that is always
greater than the existing solutions, but worse than our previous scheme. We
experimentally show how our pricing algorithms perform with respect to the
existing envy-free pricing algorithms and to the optimal exponentially
computable solution, and our experiments show that our approximation algorithms
consistently arrive at about 99% of the optimal.

ground state of a complicated Hamiltonian by starting with the ground state of
a simple Hamiltonian and slowly evolving the system to the complicated one. If
the evolution is adiabatic and the initial and final ground states are
connected due to having the same symmetry, then the simulation will be
successful. But in most experiments, adiabatic simulation is not possible
because it would take too long, and the system has some level of diabatic
excitation. In this work, we quantify the extent of the diabatic excitation
even if we do not know {\it a priori} what the complicated ground state is.
Since many quantum simulator platforms, like trapped ions, can measure the
probabilities to be in a product state, we describe techniques that can employ
these measurements to estimate the probability of being in the ground state of
the system after the diabatic evolution. These techniques do not require one to
know any properties about the Hamiltonian itself, nor to calculate its
eigenstate properties. All the information is derived by analyzing the
product-state measurements as functions of time.

exhibit well defined variability, using visual inspection. The variability
period and amplitude of C1 stars (stars having Teff < 4200 K) were computed
using Lomb-Scargle and harmonic fit methods. The trends found in the V-I vs J-K
color-color diagram are in agreement with standard empirical calibrations for
M-giants. The sources located towards the inner regions of the Galaxy are
distributed throughout the diagram while the majority of the stars towards the
outer regions of the Galaxy are spread between the calibrations of M-giants and
the predicted position for Carbon stars. The stars classified as supergiants
follow a different sequence from the one found for giant stars. We also
performed a KS test of the period and amplitude of stars towards the inner and
outer regions of the Galaxy. We obtained a low probability that the two samples
come from the same parent distribution. The observed behavior of the
period-amplitude and period-Teff diagrams are, in general, in agreement with
those found for Kepler sources and ground based photometry, with pulsation
being the dominant cause responsible for the observed modulation. We also
conclude that short-time variations on M-Giant stars do not exist orare very
rare and the few cases we found are possibly related to biases or background

to limit the coherence times of neutral donor nuclear spins in silicon. Here,
the impact of this mechanism on $^{31}$P nuclear spin coherence is measured as
a function of $^{29}$Si concentration using X-band pulsed electron nuclear
double resonance (ENDOR). The $^{31}$P nuclear spin echo decays show that
decoherence is controlled by $^{29}$Si flip-flops resulting in both fast

decay times span a range from 100 ms in crystals containing 50% $^{29}$Si to 3
s in crystals containing 1% $^{29}$Si. These nuclear spin echo decay times for
neutral donors are orders of magnitude longer than those reported for ionized
donors in natural silicon. The electron spin of the neutral donors `protects'
the donor nuclear spins by suppressing $^{29}$Si flip-flops within a `frozen
core', as a result of the detuning of the $^{29}$Si spins caused by their
hyperfine coupling to the electron spin.

the treatment of system sizes inaccessible by any numerically exact method and

We show that for a sufficiently strong disorder the system becomes nonergodic,

bias in producing galactic conformity by considering 18,000 galaxies with
$M_{stellar}$ > $2 \times 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. We find a significant signal of
galactic conformity: out to distances of about 10 Mpc, the mean red fraction of
galaxies around redder galaxies is higher than around bluer galaxies at fixed
stellar mass. Dark matter haloes exhibit an analogous conformity signal, in
which the fraction of haloes formed at earlier times (old haloes) is higher
around old haloes than around younger ones at fixed halo mass. A plausible
interpretation of galactic conformity can be given as a combination of the halo
conformity signal with the galaxy color-halo age relation: at fixed stellar
mass, particularly toward the low-mass end, Illustris' galaxy colors correlate
with halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) being
preferentially found in the oldest haloes. In fact, we can explain the galactic
conformity effect with a simple semi-empirical model, by assigning stellar mass
based on halo mass (abundance matching) and by assigning galaxy color based on
halo age (age matching). We investigate other interpretations for the galactic
conformity, particularly its dependence on the isolation criterion and on the
central-satellite information. Regarding comparison to observations, we
conclude that the adopted selection/isolation criteria, projection effects, and
stacking techniques can have a significant impact on the measured amplitude of
the conformity signal.

because the central region of quasars where accretion takes place is unresolved

is one of the few techniques that can test this model, yielding to the
measurement of the size and of temperature profile of the accretion disc. We
present spectroscopic observations of the gravitationally lensed broad
absorption line quasar H1413+117, which reveal partial microlensing of the
continuum emission that appears to originate from two separated regions: a
microlensed region, corresponding to the compact accretion disc; and a
non-microlensed region, more extended and contributing to at least 30\% of the
total UV-continuum flux. Because this extended continuum is occulted by the
broad absorption line clouds, it is not associated with the host galaxy, but
rather with light scattered in the neighbourhood of the central engine. We
measure the amplitude of microlensing of the compact continuum over the
rest-frame wavelength range 1000-7000 \AA. Following a Bayesian scheme, we
confront our measurements to microlensing simulations of an accretion disc with
a temperature varying as $T \propto R^{-1/\nu}$. We find a most likely source
half-light radius of $R_{1/2} = 0.61 \times 10^{16}\,$cm (i.e., 0.002\,pc) at

H1413+117, the existence of an extended continuum in addition to the disc

unlikely to solve the tension between the microlensing source size and standard

constant is smaller than the substrate lattice period. As a function of the
substrate strength and filling factor, within the pinned state we observe a
series of order-disorder transitions associated with buckling phenomena in
which the number of vortex rows that fit between neighboring substrate maxima
increases. These transitions coincide with steps in the depinning threshold,
jumps in the density of topological defects, and changes in the structure
factor. At the buckling transition the vortices are disordered, while between
the buckling transitions the vortices form a variety of crystalline and
partially ordered states. In the weak substrate limit, the buckling transitions
are absent and the vortices form an ordered hexagonal lattice that undergoes
changes in its orientation with respect to the substrate as a function of
vortex density. At intermediate substrate strengths, certain ordered states
appear that are correlated with peaks in the depinning force. Under an applied
drive the system exhibits a rich variety of distinct dynamical phases,
including plastic flow, a density-modulated moving crystal, and moving floating
solid phases. We also find a dynamic smectic-to-smectic transition in which the
smectic ordering changes from being aligned with the substrate to being aligned
with the external drive. The different dynamical phases can be characterized
using velocity histograms and the structure factor. We discuss how these
results are related to recent experiments on vortex ordering on
quasi-one-dimensional periodic modulated substrates. Our results should also be

the shock velocity in the flow divided by the Alfv\'en velocity, for
low-velocity (V$_{shock}$ $\lesssim$ 100 km$\,$s$^{-1}$) radiative shocks. The
method combines observations of bright forbidden lines with a measure of the
size of the cooling zone, the latter typically obtained from spatial separation
between the Balmer emission lines and the forbidden lines. Because magnetic
fields become compressed as gas in the postshock region cools, even relatively
weak preshock magnetic fields can be detected with this method. We derive
analytical formulae that explain how the spatial separations relate to
emission-line ratios, and compute a large grid of radiatively-cooled shock
models to develop diagnostic diagrams that can be used to derive Alfv\'enic
Mach numbers in flows. Applying the method to existing data for a bright knot

concerns related to privacy violations for both end-users and service

community, and several techniques have been proposed to protect against
malicious parties by providing secure communication protocols. Most of the
proposed techniques, however, require the involvement of a third party, and
this by itself can be viewed as another security concern. These security
breaches can be avoided by following a new approach that depends on data
sorted, managed, and stored in encrypted form at the remote servers. To realize
such an approach, the encryption cryptosystem must support algebraic operations
over encrypted data. This cryptosystem can be effective in protecting data and
supporting the construction of programs that can process encrypted input and
produce encrypted output. In fact, the latter programs do not decrypt the
input, and therefore, they can be run by an un-trusted party without revealing
their data and internal states. Furthermore, such programs prove to be
practical in situations where we need to outsource private computations,
especially in the context of cloud computing. Homomorphic cryptosystems are
perfectly aligned with these objectives as they are a strong foundation for
schemes that allow a blind processing of encrypted data without the need to
decrypt them. In this dissertation we rely on homomorphic encryption schemes to
secure cloud computing, services and routing protocols. We design several
circuits that allow for the blind processing and management of data such that
malicious parties are denied access to sensitive information. We select five
areas to apply our models to. These models are easily customized for many other
areas. We also provide prototypes that we use to study the performance and
robustness of our models.

approach, we provide a guideline elaborating on their operation principles,
performance metrics and design parameters. We then provide a simple model for

discuss the practical challenges of implementing the receiver and present the
future research avenues from a communication theoretical perspective.

redshift sources with a spatially resolved size extend the tight trend seen
between [C II]/FIR ratio and $\Sigma_{FIR}$ among IR-bright galaxies reported

the supernova remnant (SNR) SNR G5.7-0.1 using data collected by the Large Area
Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The SNR is believed to be
interacting with molecular clouds, based on 1720 MHz hydroxyl (OH) maser
emission observations in its direction. This interaction is expected to provide
targets for the production of $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay. A
$\gamma$-ray source was observed in the direction of SNR G5.7-0.1, positioned
nearby the bright $\gamma$-ray source SNR W28. We model the emission from radio
to $\gamma$-ray energies using a one-zone model. Following consideration of
both $\pi^0$-decay and leptonically dominated emission scenarios for the
MeV-TeV source, we conclude that a considerable component of the $\gamma$-ray
emission must originate from the $\pi^0$-decay channel. Finally, constraints
were placed on the reported ambiguity of the SNR distance through X-ray column
density measurements made using XMM-Newton observations. We conclude SNR
G5.7-0.1 is a significant $\gamma$-ray source positioned at a distance of $\sim
3$ kpc with luminosity in the 0.1--100 GeV range of $L_{\gamma} \approx 7.4
\times 10^{34}$ erg/s.

method for the coupled elliptic sine-Gordon equations along with Cauchy data.
The system of equations originates from the static case of the coupled
hyperbolic sine-Gordon equations modeling the coupled Josephson junctions in
superconductivity, and so far it addresses the Josephson $\pi$-junctions. In
general, the Cauchy problem is not well-posed, and herein the
Hadamard-instability occurs drastically. Generalizing the kernel-based
regularization method, we propose a stable approximate solution. Confirmed by
the error estimate, this solution strongly converges to the exact solution in
$L^2$-norm. The main concern of this paper is also with the way to compute the
regularized solution formed by an alike integral equation. We employ the
proposed techniques that successfully approximated the highly oscillatory
integral, and apply the Picard-like iteration to organize an efficient and
reliable tool of computations. The results are viewed as the improvement as
well as the generalization of many previous works. The paper is also
accompanied by a numerical example that demonstrates the potential of this

are generally thought to have co-evolved. However, the SMBH cannot evolve so
fast as commonly observed even at redshift $z>6$. Therefore SMBH must form
first before galaxy. Our goal is to clarify how this mature SMBH forms galaxy.
Furthermore we clarify the mechanism how the SMBH designs variety of structures
of galaxies. We explore a natural hypothesis that the SMBH has been formed
mature at $z\approx10$ before stars and galaxies. The SMBH forms energetic jets
and outflows which trigger massive star formation in the ambient gas. They
eventually construct globular clusters and classical bulge as well as the body
of elliptical galaxies. We propose simple models which implement these
processes along with the standard $\Lambda$CDM-model. We point out that the
globular clusters and classical bulges have a common origin but are in
different phases. The same is true for the elliptical and spiral galaxies.
Physics behind these phase division is the runaway star formation process with
strong feedback to SMBH. This is similar to the forest-fire model that displays
self-organized criticality. Finally we speculate several observational
predictions that may help to test the present arguments.

transition strengths is expressed in terms of the double commutator between the
excitation operator and the Hamiltonian, as in nonrelativistic models. The
commutator, however, should not be calculated with a usual way in the local
field theory, because, otherwise, the sum vanishes. The sum value obtained
correctly from the commutator is infinite, owing to the Dirac sea. Most of the
previous calculations takes into account only a part of the nucleon-antinucleon
states, in order to avoid the divergence problems. As a result, RPA states with
negative excitation energy appear, which make the sum value vanish. Moreover,
disregarding the divergence changes the sign of nuclear interactions in the RPA
equation which describes the coupling of the nucleon particle-hole states with
the nucleon-antinucleon states. Indeed, excitation energies of the spurious
state and giant monopole states in the no-sea approximation are dominated by
those unphysical changes. The baryon current conservation can be described
without touching the divergence problems. A schematic model with separable
interactions is presented, which makes the structure of the relativistic RPA

chains such as the Tsetlin library and riffle shuffle. The representation
theory of left regular bands then comes into play and has had a major influence
on both the combinatorics and the probability theory associated to such
structures. In a recent paper, the authors established a close connection
between algebraic and combinatorial invariants of a left regular band by
showing that certain homological invariants of the algebra of a left regular
band coincide with the cohomology of order complexes of posets naturally
associated to the left regular band.
  The purpose of the present monograph is to further develop and deepen the
connection between left regular bands and poset topology. This allows us to
compute finite projective resolutions of all simple modules of left regular
band algebras over fields and much more. In the process, we are led to define
the class of CW left regular bands as the class of left regular bands whose
associated posets are the face posets of regular CW complexes. Most of the
examples that have arisen in the literature belong to this class. A new and
important class of examples is a left regular band structure on the face poset
of a CAT(0) cube complex. Also, the recently introduced notion of a COM

depends in a smooth way on a large number of independent random variables is
essentially constant. The random variable will ""concentrate"" around its median
or expectation. In this work, we explore several theories and applications of
concentration of measure. The results of the thesis are divided into three main
parts. In the first part, we explore concentration of measure for several
random operator compressions and for the length of the longest increasing
subsequence of a random walk evolving under the asymmetric exclusion process,
by generalizing an approach of Chatterjee and Ledoux. In the second part, we
consider the mixed matrix moments of the complex Ginibre ensemble and relate
them to the expected overlap functions of the eigenvectors as introduced by
Chalker and Mehlig. In the third part, we develop a $q$-Stirling's formula and
discuss a method for simulating a random permutation distributed according to
the Mallows measure. We then apply the $q$-Stirling's formula to obtain
asymptotics for a four square decomposition of points distributed in a square
according to the Mallows measure. All of the results in the third part are
preliminary steps toward bounding the fluctuations of the length of the longest
increasing subsequence of a Mallows permutation.

reconstruct the explicit EoS for a fluid from the spectral index of the

The running of the spectral index can explain the Planck data. In addition, it
is demonstrated that in the reconstructed models of a fluid, the graceful exit
from inflation can be realized. Moreover, we show that the singular inflation

difficulties in the numerical solution of the model in application to
photospheric boundary data. We investigate the sensitivity of the modeling to
the spatial resolution of the boundary data, by applying multiple codes that
numerically solve the NLFFF model to a sequence of vector magnetogram data at
different resolutions, prepared from a single Hinode/SOT-SP scan of NOAA Active
Region 10978 on 2007 December 13. We analyze the resulting energies and
relative magnetic helicities, employ a Helmholtz decomposition to characterize
divergence errors, and quantify changes made by the codes to the vector
magnetogram boundary data in order to be compatible with the force-free model.
This study shows that NLFFF modeling results depend quantitatively on the
spatial resolution of the input boundary data, and that using more highly
resolved boundary data yields more self-consistent results. The free energies
of the resulting solutions generally trend higher with increasing resolution,
while relative magnetic helicity values vary significantly between resolutions
for all methods. All methods require changing the horizontal components, and
for some methods also the vertical components, of the vector magnetogram
boundary field in excess of nominal uncertainties in the data. The solutions
produced by the various methods are significantly different at each resolution
level. We continue to recommend verifying agreement between the modeled field
lines and corresponding coronal loop images before any NLFFF model is used in a

rise in popularity due to its powerful abilities to represent and model

networks that is ripe for exploration is neural connectivity formation. A
pivotal study on the brain tissue of rats found that synaptic formation for
specific functional connectivity in neocortical neural microcircuits can be
surprisingly well modeled and predicted as a random formation. Motivated by
this intriguing finding, we introduce the concept of StochasticNet, where deep
neural networks are formed via stochastic connectivity between neurons. As a
result, any type of deep neural networks can be formed as a StochasticNet by
allowing the neuron connectivity to be stochastic. Stochastic synaptic
formations, in a deep neural network architecture, can allow for efficient
utilization of neurons for performing specific tasks. To evaluate the
feasibility of such a deep neural network architecture, we train a
StochasticNet using four different image datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, SVHN, and
STL-10). Experimental results show that a StochasticNet, using less than half
the number of neural connections as a conventional deep neural network,
achieves comparable accuracy and reduces overfitting on the CIFAR-10, MNIST and
SVHN dataset. Interestingly, StochasticNet with less than half the number of
neural connections, achieved a higher accuracy (relative improvement in test
error rate of ~6% compared to ConvNet) on the STL-10 dataset than a
conventional deep neural network. Finally, StochasticNets have faster
operational speeds while achieving better or similar accuracy performances.

These composites are manufactured using desirable ""bottom-up"" techniques, such
as phase separation of a liquid crystal/polymer mixture, which enable
production of PDLC films at very large scales. LC domains within PDLCs are
typically spheroidal, as opposed to rectangular for an LCD panel, and thus
exhibit substantially different behaviour in the presence of an external field.
The fundamental difference between spheroidal and rectangular nematic domains
is that the former results in the presence of nanoscale orientational defects
in LC order while the latter does not. Progress in the development and
optimization of PDLC electro-optical properties has progressed at a relatively
slow pace due to this increased complexity. In this work, continuum simulations
are performed in order to capture the complex formation and electric

to the number of components, it is useful to have simplified mathematical
models of spiking in such neurons so that, for example, stochastic features of
inputs and output spike trains can be incorporated. In this article we
investigate two simple two-component models which mimic features of spiking in
serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus and noradrenergic neurons of
the locus coeruleus. The first model is of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo type and the
second is a reduced Hodgkin-Huxley model. For each model solutions are computed
with two representative sets of parameters. Frequency versus input currents are
found and reveal Hodgkin type 2 behavior. For the first model a bifurcation and
phase plane analysis supports these findings. The spike trajectories in the
second model are very similar to those in DRN SE pacemaker activity but there
are more parameters than in the Fitzhugh-Nagumo type model. The article
concludes with a brief review of previous modeling of these types of neurons
and its relevance to studies of serotonergic involvement in spatial working
memory and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

possible energy-supply assumption to explain the rebrightenings of radio
afterglows, in which the central engine with multiple active phases can supply
at least two GRB pulses in a typical GRB duration time. Considering the case of
double pulses supplied by the central engine, the double pulses have separate
physical parameters, except for the number density of the surrounding
interstellar medium (ISM). Their independent radio afterglows are integrated by
the ground detectors to form the rebrightening phenomenon. In this work, we
firstly simulate diverse rebrightening light curves under consideration of
different and independent physical parameters. Using this assumption, we also
give our best fit to the radio afterglow of GRB 970508 at three frequencies of
1.43, 4.86, and 8.46 GHz. We suggest that the central engine may be active
continuously at a timescale longer than that of a typical GRB duration time as
many authors have suggested, and that it may supply enough energy to cause the
long-lasting rebrightenings observed in some GRB afterglows.

NGC 5430 shows minimal signs of recent interactions in our resolution. The
apparent morphological remnant of the past galaxy interaction is an asymmetric
spiral arm, containing more molecular gas and exhibiting higher star formation
rate (SFR) surface density than the two primary arms. Rotation curve analysis
suggests that NGC 5430 and its satellite collided several Gyr ago. History of
star formation was constrained by using SFRs that trace different timescales
(infrared, radio continuum, and H-alpha). The collision occurred 5 - 10 Myr
ago, triggering a transient off-center starburst of Wolf-Rayet stars at the
eastern bar end. In the past, the global SFR during the Wolf-Rayet starburst
peaked at 35 Msun/yr. At present, the merger-driven starburst is rapidly
decaying and the current global SFR has decreased to the Galactic value. The
SFR will continue to decay as suggested by the present amount of dense gas
(traced by HCN (1-0)). Nonetheless, the global SFR is still dominated by the
Wolf-Rayet region rather than the circumnuclear region. Compared with other
barred galaxies, the circumnuclear region exhibits particularly low dense gas
fraction, low star formation activity and high concentration of gas. Physical
properties of the molecular gas are inferred by using the large velocity

the values of Q_D^* have been calculated numerically while taking into
consideration various physical properties such as self-gravity, material

been sufficiently investigated. In this paper, using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) method, we performed numerical simulations of collisions
between planetesimals at various numerical resolutions (from 2 x 10^4 to 5 x
10^6 SPH particles) and investigated the resulting variation in Q_D^*. The
value of Q_D^* is shown to decrease as the number of SPH particles increases,

for 5 x 10^6 SPH particles do not fully converge, higher-resolution simulations

on impact parameters and material parameters, our results indicate that at

They are seen as anchors of stability islands where collapse of small

experiences catastrophic breakdown with a dramatically high rate of energy
dissipation, caused by the inter-vibrational-mode coupling. By tracking this

avoid the catastrophe and extend the lifetime of superlubricity. This concept

the risks posed by epidemic spreading and informed strategies to contain

disease becomes more prevalent, it can limit the availability of the capital
needed to effectively treat those who have fallen ill. Here we use a simple
mathematical model to gain insight into the dynamics of an epidemic when the
recovery of sick individuals depends on the availability of healing resources
that are generated by the healthy population. We find that epidemics spiral out
of control into ""explosive"" spread if the cost of recovery is above a critical
cost. This can occur even when the disease would die out without the resource
constraint. The onset of explosive epidemics is very sudden, exhibiting a
discontinuous transition under very general assumptions. We find analytical
expressions for the critical cost and the size of the explosive jump in
infection levels in terms of the parameters that characterize the spreading
process. Our model and results apply beyond epidemics to contagion dynamics
that self-induce constraints on recovery, thereby amplifying the spreading

temperature and high magnetic field have shown the Fermi surface of underdoped
cuprates to contain a small closed electron pocket. It is thought to result
from a reconstruction by charge order, but whether it is the order seen by NMR
and ultrasound above a threshold field or the short-range modulations seen by
X-ray diffraction in zero field is unclear. Here we use measurements of the
thermal Hall conductivity in YBCO to show that Fermi-surface reconstruction
occurs only above a sharply defined onset field, equal to the transition field
seen in ultrasound. This reveals that electrons do not experience long-range
broken translational symmetry in the zero-field ground state, and hence in zero
field there is no quantum critical point for the onset of charge order as a
function of doping.

novel Sorting-based Preprocessing Approach (SPA) for planar point sets. The
proposed algorithm consists of two stages: (1) two rounds of preprocessing
performed on the GPU and (2) the finalization of calculating the expected
convex hull on the CPU. We first discard the interior points that locate inside
a quadrilateral formed by four extreme points, and then distribute the
remaining points into several (typically four) sub regions. For each subset of
points, we first sort them in parallel, then perform the second round of
discarding using SPA, and finally form a simple chain for the current remaining
points. A simple polygon can be easily generated by directly connecting all the
chains in sub regions. We at last obtain the expected convex hull of the input
points by calculating the convex hull of the simple polygon. We use the library
Thrust to realize the parallel sorting, reduction, and partitioning for better
efficiency and simplicity. Experimental results show that our algorithm
achieves 5x ~ 6x speedups over the Qhull implementation for 20M points. Thus,
this algorithm is competitive in practical applications for its simplicity and
satisfied efficiency.

curves of perovskite solar cells. The origins responsible for hysteresis are
primarily attributed to ferroelectricity, trapping/de-trapping, and ions
migration. Meanwhile, a switchable photovoltaic effect is disclosed in lateral
structure perovskite solar cells, where a p-i-n structure is formed after
poling the device with a reverse bias. Considering the normal sandwiched
structure of perovskite solar cells, i.e. the intrinsic perovskite layer is
situated in an electric field built by p-type (Spiro-OMeTAD) and n-type (TiO2)
layers, the poling process also works in such devices. The migration of ions
will induce a new electric field with opposite direction as inherent built-in
electric field. As a consequence, less collection of photogenerated carriers is
predicted due to the built-in electric field is partially screened. Here, the
ions induced electric field is experimentally demonstrated by exploring the
external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra under various forward voltage biases.
The anomalous hysteresis observed on J-V curves is explained based on the
insight of ions migrations under bias voltage. The external applied voltage
presents significant influence on the stability of solar cells. Meanwhile, a
novel phenomenon of negative capacitance is initially detected at low
frequency, which is ascribed to the position reversal of negatively and
positively charged ions under forward bias.

rotating neutron stars, which are initially strongly oscillating. They
represent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are
detectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on
the equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the
frequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total
binary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the
radii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the
dominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high
accuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and
asymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the
binary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We
summarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating
neutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of
the postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant
can be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be
described by concepts of asteroseismology. The understanding of the different
mechanisms shaping the gravitational-wave signal yields a physically motivated
analytic model of the gravitational-wave emission, which may form the basis for
template-based gravitational-wave data analysis. We explore the observational
consequences of a scenario of two families of compact stars including hadronic
and quark stars. We find that this scenario leaves a distinctive imprint on the
postmerger gravitational-wave signal. In particular, a strong discontinuity in
the dominant postmerger frequency as function of the total mass will be a
strong indication for two families of compact stars. (abridged)

wind speeds at higher altitudes. The configuration considered in this paper is
based on a tethered kite flown in a pumping orbit. This pumping cycle generates
energy by winching out at high tether forces and driving a generator while
flying figures-of-eight, or lemniscates, as crosswind pattern. Then, the tether
is reeled in while keeping the kite at a neutral position, thus leaving a net
amount of generated energy. In order to achieve an economic operation,
optimization of pumping cycles is of great interest.
  In this paper, first the principles of airborne wind energy will be briefly
revisited. The first contribution is a singularity-free model for the tethered
kite dynamics in quaternion representation, where the model is derived from
first principles. The second contribution is an optimal control formulation and
numerical results for complete pumping cycles. Based on the developed model,
the setup of the optimal control problem (OCP) is described in detail along
with its numerical solution based on the direct multiple shooting method in the
CasADi optimization environment. Optimization results for a pumping cycle
consisting of six lemniscates show that the approach is capable to find an
optimal orbit in a few minutes of computation time. For this optimal orbit, the
power output is increased by a factor of two compared to a sophisticated
initial guess for the considered test scenario.

finding strategies of players in games, synthesising circuits and bit-vector

known experimentally to play an important role in protein-ligand

to the Turner energy model, where free energy parameters are determined from UV
aborption experiments. An algorithm to compute the derivational entropy for RNA
secondary structures had previously been introduced, using stochastic context
free grammars (SCFGs). However, the numerical value of derivational entropy
depends heavily on the chosen context free grammar and on the training set used
to estimate rule probabilities. Using data from the Rfam database, we determine
that both of our thermodynamic methods, which agree in numerical value, are
substantially faster than the SCFG method. Thermodynamic structural entropy is
much smaller than derivational entropy, and the correlation between
length-normalized thermodynamic entropy and derivational entropy is moderately
weak to poor. In applications, we plot the structural entropy as a function of
temperature for known thermoswitches, determine that the correlation between
hammerhead ribozyme cleavage activity and total free energy is improved by
including an additional free energy term arising from conformational entropy,
and plot the structural entropy of windows of the HIV-1 genome. Our software
RNAentropy can compute structural entropy for any user-specified temperature,

that RNAentropy is state-of-the-art software to compute RNA secondary structure

over natural language sentences. Given a question, Neural Reasoner can infer
over multiple supporting facts and find an answer to the question in specific

allowing it to examine multiple facts, and 2) a deep architecture, allowing it
to model the complicated logical relations in reasoning tasks. Assuming no
particular structure exists in the question and facts, Neural Reasoner is able
to accommodate different types of reasoning and different forms of language
expressions. Despite the model complexity, Neural Reasoner can still be trained
effectively in an end-to-end manner. Our empirical studies show that Neural
Reasoner can outperform existing neural reasoning systems with remarkable
margins on two difficult artificial tasks (Positional Reasoning and Path
Finding) proposed in [8]. For example, it improves the accuracy on Path

For media that can be described by these types of dispersion over the relevant

can be solved by diagonalizing a second-order eigenvalue problem. In the case
of a single resonance at zero frequency, this is simplified to a generalized

breaking structural changes of the crystal unit cell and reveals the importance
of a mechano-chemical spinodal, defined as the region in strain-composition
space where the free energy density function is non-convex. The approach is
relevant to phase transformations wherein the structural order parameters can

rates using distributed techniques such as belief propagation (BP), they are
not well suited to WSNs deployed for precision agriculture applications with
large number of nodes, few number of landmarks and lack real time update
capability. The algorithm proposed here is designed for applications such as
pest control and irrigation in large farms and orchards where greater power
efficiency and scalability are required but location accuracy requirements are
less demanding. Our algorithm uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
values to estimate the distribution of distance between nodes then updates the
location probability mass function (pmf) of nodes in a distributed manner. At
every time step, the most recently communicated path loss samples and location
prior pmf received from neighbouring nodes is sufficient for nodes with unknown
location to update their location pmf. This renders the algorithm recursive,
hence results in lower computational complexity at each time step. We propose a
particular realization of the method in which only one node multicasts at each
time step and neighbouring nodes update their location pmf conditioned on all
communicated samples over previous time steps. This is highly compatible with
realistic WSN deployments, e.g., ZigBee which are based upon the ad hoc

viscosity equations of granular powders under a simple shear. The obtained
viscosity equations are examined only with empirical experimental observations
in describing powder flowability, due to the lack of instruments and
methodology for directly determining the viscosity of granular materials. The
continuous shear thickening rather than the discontinuous shear thickening are
predicted and found to be dependent on shear rate, the cohesive energy between
particles, and the particle volume fraction, though the discontinuous shear
thickening may still occur if certain conditions are met during shear, such as
local particle volume fractions approach to the jamming point created by the
shear induced inhomogeneity. A fundamental mechanism on how dry granular
powders flow is proposed on the basis of what are demonstrated from the

scale powder flowability in a more fundamental and consistent manner, at least
