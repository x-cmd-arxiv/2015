of research with applications across multiple disciplines. Here we present and
analyze a scheme for synchronizing chaotic dynamical systems by transiently
uncoupling them. Specifically, systems coupled only in a fraction of their
state space may synchronize even if fully coupled they do not. Although, for
many standard systems, coupling strengths need to be bounded to ensure
synchrony, transient uncoupling removes this bound and thus enables
synchronization in an infinite range of effective coupling strengths. The
presented coupling scheme thus opens up the possibility to induce synchrony in
(biological or technical) systems whose parameters are fixed and cannot be
modified continuously.

(torus) with curvature (tube-to-coiling diameter) 0.049 is investigated
experimentally. The flow inside the toroidal pipe is driven by a steel sphere
fitted to the inner pipe diameter. The sphere is moved with constant azimuthal
velocity from outside the torus by a moving magnet. The experiment is designed
to investigate curved pipe flow by optical measurement techniques. Using
stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, laser Doppler velocimetry and pressure
drop measurements, the flow is measured for Reynolds numbers ranging from 1000
to 15000. Time- and space-resolved velocity fields are obtained and analysed.
The steady axisymmetric basic flow is strongly influenced by centrifugal
effects. On an increase of the Reynolds number we find a sequence of
bifurcations. For Re=4075 a supercritical bifurcation to an oscillatory flow is
found in which waves travel in the streamwise direction with a phase velocity
slightly faster than the mean flow. The oscillatory flow is superseded by a
presumably quasi-periodic flow at a further increase of the Reynolds number
before turbulence sets in. The results are found to be compatible, in general,
with earlier experimental and numerical investigations on transition to
turbulence in helical and curved pipes. However, important aspects of the
bifurcation scenario differ considerably.

active substances. We use computer simulation approach to the study of CAF

principal CAF target at physiologically important concentrations refers to
adenosine receptors. It is a common opinion that CAF is a competitive
antagonist of adenosine. At the first step to molecular level elucidation of
CAF action, we have found a set of the minima of the interaction energy between
CAF and the fragments of human A1 adenosine receptor. Molecular mechanics is
the main method for the calculations of the energy of interactions between CAF
and the biopolymer fragments. We use the Monte Carlo simulation to follow
various mutual arrangements of CAF molecule near the receptor. It appears that
the deepest energy minima refer to hydrogen-bond formation of CAF with amino
acid residues involved in interactions with adenosine, its agonists and
antagonists. The results suggest that the formation of such CAF-receptor
complexes enforced by a close packing of CAF and the receptor fragments is the
reason of CAF actions on nervous system. CAF can block the atomic groups of the
adenosine repressors responsible for the interactions with adenosine, not
necessary by the formation of H bonds with them, but simply hide these groups
from the interactions with adenosine.

$K/\mathbb{Q}$ must always have an infinite Hilbert $2$-class field tower when
the class group of $K$ has $2$-rank $4$, or equivalently when the discriminant
of $K$ has $5$ prime factors. No negative results are known. Benjamin (2001,
2002) and Sueyoshi (2004, 2009, 2010) systematically established infinite
$2$-towers for many $K$ in question, by casework on the associated R\'{e}dei
matrices. Others, notably Mouhib (2010), have also made progress, but still
many cases remain open, especially when the the class group of $K$ has small
$4$-rank.
  Recently, Benjamin (2015) made partial progress on several of these open
matrices when the class group of $K$ has $4$-rank $1$ or $2$. In this paper, we
partially address many open cases when the $4$-rank is $0$ or $2$,
affirmatively answering some questions of Benjamin. We then investigate
barriers to our methods and ask an extension question (of independent interest)
in this direction. Finally, we suggest places where speculative refinements of
Golod--Shafarevich or group classification methods might overcome the `near

to Digital converter. The camera will be equipped with 265 7-photomultiplier
modules, covering a field of view of 8 degrees. Each module includes the
photomultiplier bases, high voltage supply, pre-amplifier, trigger, readout and
Ethernet transceiver. The recorded events last between a few nanoseconds and
tens of nanoseconds. The camera trigger will be flexible so as to minimize the
read-out dead-time of the NECTAr chips. NectarCAM is designed to sustain a data

the X-ray light curves, finding a consistent correlation. We therefore explore
how the parameters of these correlations relate to the prompt emission phase
and, using a Monte Carlo simulation, explore whether these correlations are
consistent with predictions of the standard afterglow model. We find
significant correlations between: $\rm log\;L_{O,200\rm{s}}$ and $\rm
log\;L_{X,200\rm{s}}$; $\alpha_{O,>200\rm{s}}$ and $\alpha_{X,>200\rm{s}}$,
consistent with simulations. The model also predicts relationships between $\rm
log\;E_{iso}$ and $\rm log\;L_{200\rm{s}}$, however, while we find such
relationships in the observed sample, the slope of the linear regression is
shallower than that simulated and inconsistent at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$.
Simulations also do not agree with correlations observed between $\rm
log\;L_{200\rm{s}}$ and $\alpha_{>200\rm{s}}$, or $\rm log\;E_{iso}$ and
$\alpha_{>200\rm{s}}$. Overall, these observed correlations are consistent with
a common underlying physical mechanism producing GRBs and their afterglows
regardless of their detailed temporal behaviour. However, a basic afterglow
model has difficulty explaining all the observed correlations. This leads us to
briefly discuss alternative more complex models.

(C-RAN) architecture is constrained by the two-way latency on the fronthaul
links connecting the Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) with the Baseband Units (BBUs)
that perform decoding. To overcome this limitation, this work considers an
architecture based on the separation of control and data planes, in which
retransmission control decisions are made at the edge of the network, that is,
by the RRHs or User Equipments (UEs), while data decoding is carried out
remotely at the BBUs. This solution enables low-latency local retransmission
decisions to be made at the RRHs or UEs, which are not subject to the fronthaul
latency constraints, while at the same time leveraging the decoding capability
of the BBUs.
  A system with BBU Hoteling system is considered first in which each RRH has a
dedicated BBU in the cloud. For this system, the control-data separation
leverages low-latency local feedback from an RRH to drive the HARQ process of a
given UE. Throughput and probability of error of this solution are analyzed for
the three standard HARQ modes of Type-I, Chase Combining and Incremental
Redundancy over a general fading MIMO link. Then, novel user-centric
low-latency feedback strategies are proposed and analyzed for the C-RAN
architecture, with a single centralized BBU, based on limited ""hard"" or ""soft""
local feedback from the RRHs to the UE and on retransmission decisions taken at
the UE. The analysis presented in this work allows the optimization of the
considered schemes, as well as the investigation of the impact of system
parameters such as HARQ protocol type, blocklength and number of antennas on
the performance of low-latency local HARQ decisions in BBU Hoteling and C-RAN

of spherical nanoparticles on top of amorphous silicon show that both silicon
and silver nanoparticle coatings demonstrate strong anti-reflective properties
in the visible spectral range. In this work, we show for the first time that
blooming effect, that is zero reflection from the structure, with silicon
coatings originates from the interference of electric- and magnetic-dipole
responses of nanoparticles with the wave reflected from the substrate, and we
refer to it as substrate-mediated Kerker effect. For the silver coating, our
results agree with previously observed substrate-induced bi-anisotropy and
blooming, caused by substrate-induced magnetic response. Finally, we
numerically show high effectiveness of silicon and silver coatings for the
application in thin-film photovoltaic elements, which is related to the
suppression of reflection from the high-index substrate and increased light
absorbance in the active layer with coating. Depending on the nanoparticle
size, either silicon or silver coating is more efficient, and overall increase
of absorption up to 30% can be achieved.

interest. As such there is a wealth of studies of their shear and tensile
responses, but their compressive behavior remains unexplored. Here, by
characterization of the network structure with synchronous measurement of the
fibrin storage and loss moduli at increasing degrees of compression, we show
that the compressive behavior of fibrin networks is similar to that of cellular
solids. A non-linear stress-strain response of fibrin consists of three
regimes: 1) an initial linear regime, in which most fibers are straight, 2) a
plateau regime, in which more and more fibers buckle and collapse, and 3) a
markedly non-linear regime, in which network densification occurs {{by bending
of buckled fibers}} and inter-fiber contacts. Importantly, the spatially
non-uniform network deformation included formation of a moving ""compression
front"" along the axis of strain, which segregated the fibrin network into
compartments with different fiber densities and structure. The Young's modulus
of the linear phase depends quadratically on the fibrin volume fraction while
that in the densified phase depends cubically on it. The viscoelastic plateau
regime corresponds to a mixture of these two phases in which the fractions of
the two phases change during compression. We model this regime using a
continuum theory of phase transitions and analytically predict the storage and
loss moduli which are in good agreement with the experimental data. Our work
shows that fibrin networks are a member of a broad class of natural cellular
materials which includes cancellous bone, wood and cork.

Processors have input values from some set $V$ and they have to decide the same
value from this set. If all processors have the same input value, then they
must all decide this value. We study the task of consensus in a Multiple Access
Channel (MAC) prone to faults, under a very weak communication model called the
$\mathit{beeping\ model}$. Communication proceeds in synchronous rounds. Some
processors wake up spontaneously, in possibly different rounds decided by an
adversary. In each round, an awake processor can either listen, i.e., stay
silent, or beep, i.e., emit a signal. In each round, a fault can occur in the
channel independently with constant probability $0<p<1$. In a fault-free round,
an awake processor hears a beep if it listens in this round and if one or more
other processors beep in this round. A processor still dormant in a fault-free
round in which some other processor beeps is woken up by this beep and hears
it. In a faulty round nothing is heard, regardless of the behaviour of the
processors.
  An algorithm working with error probability at most $\epsilon$, for a given
$\epsilon>0$, is called $\epsilon$-$\mathit{safe}$. Our main result is the
design and analysis, for any constant $\epsilon>0$, of a deterministic
$\epsilon$-safe consensus algorithm that works in time $O(\log w)$ in a
fault-prone MAC, where $w$ is the smallest input value of all participating
processors. We show that this time cannot be improved, even when the MAC is
fault-free. The main algorithmic tool that we develop to achieve our goal, and
that might be of independent interest, is a deterministic algorithm that, with
arbitrarily small constant error probability, establishes a global clock in a
fault-prone MAC in constant time.

modeling, behavioral finance and applications of Game Theory, integrating the
empirical finding, from human decision analysis, that shows that nonlinear
update rules in probabilities, leading to non-additive decision weights, can be
computationally approached from quantum computation, with resulting quantum
interference terms explaining the non-additive probabilities. The current work
draws on these results to introduce new tools from Quantum Artificial
Intelligence, namely Quantum Artificial Neural Networks as a way to build and
simulate financial market models with adaptive selection of trading rules,
leading to turbulence and excess kurtosis in the returns distributions for a
wide range of parameters.

we consider an energy constrained secondary user which harvests energy from the
primary signal and relays the primary signal in exchange for the spectrum

namely time-splitting cooperative spectrum sharing (TS-CSS) and power-sharing
cooperative spectrum sharing (PS-CSS), and derive expressions for the outage
probabilities of the primary and secondary user in decode-forward and
amplify-forward relaying modes. From the obtained results, it has been shown
that the secondary user can carry its own transmission without adversely
affecting the performance of the primary user and that PS-CSS protocol
outperforms the TS-PSS protocol in terms of outage probability over a wide
range of Signal to noise ratio(SNRs). The effect of various system parameters
on the outage performance of these protocols have also been studied.

and Doppler spectroscopy are used to measure the radii and masses respectively
of planets relative to those of their host star, estimates for the true values
of these quantities rely on theoretical models of the host star which are known
to suffer from systematic differences with observations. When a system is
composed of more than two bodies, extra information is contained in the transit
photometry and radial velocity data. Velocity information (finite
speed-of-light, Doppler) is needed to break the Newtonian $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy.
We performed a photodynamical modelling of the two-planet transiting system
Kepler-117 using all photometric and spectroscopic data available. We
demonstrate how absolute masses and radii of single-star planetary systems can
be obtained without resorting to stellar models. Limited by the precision of
available radial velocities (38 $ms^{-1}$), we achieve accuracies of 20 per
cent in the radii and 70 per cent in the masses, while simulated 1 $ms^{-1}$
precision radial velocities lower these to 1 per cent for the radii and 2 per
cent for the masses. Since transiting multi-planet systems are common, this
technique can be used to measure precisely the mass and radius of a large
sample of stars and planets. We anticipate these measurements will become
common when the TESS and PLATO mission provide high-precision light curves of a
large sample of bright stars. These determinations will improve our knowledge

Uranus, Jupiter, Neptune, and Saturn are shown to be directly related to photon
energies in the spectra of atomic and molecular hydrogen. To explain these
observations a model was developed involving stimulated radiative molecular
association (SRMA) reactions among photons and atoms in the protosatellite
disks of the planets. In the present investigation, the previously developed
model is applied to the planets and important satellites of the Sun. A key
component of the model involves resonance associated with SRMA. Through this
resonance, thermal energy is extracted from the protosun's protoplanetary disk
at specific distances from the protosun wherever there is a match between the
local thermal energy of the disk and the energy of photons impinging on the
disk. Orbital radii of the planets and satellites are related to photon
energies ($E_P$ values) in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen. An expression
determined previously is used to relate $E_P$ values to temperatures in the
disk. Results indicate the surface temperature of the protosun at the time when
the evolution of the planets begins is higher than the surface temperature of a
typical T Tauri star. The present investigation offers an explanation for the
existence of the asteroid and classical Kuiper belts and predicts that a
primordial belt once existed in the vicinity of Neptune. It also indicates that
Uranus is formed from two protoplanets and is thus consistent with the theory
that the large tilt of Uranus's axis of rotation was created by the collision
of two bodies.

large-scale magnetic fields. To achieve fields strong enough to seed the
galactic dynamo, most of the mechanisms operate outside conventional
electromagnetic theory. The latter is typically restored after the end of the
de Sitter phase. Breaking away from standard electromagnetism can lead to
substantially stronger magnetic fields by the end of inflation, thus
compensating for the their subsequent adiabatic depletion. We argue that the
drastic magnetic enhancement during the de Sitter era may no longer be
necessary because, contrary to the widespread perception, superhorizon-sized
magnetic fields decay at a slower pace after inflation. The principle behind
this claim is causality, which confines the post-inflationary electric currents
inside the horizon. Without the currents there can be no magnetic-flux freezing
on super-Hubble lengths. There, the magnetic decay-rate slows down, thus making
it much easier to produce primordial fields of astrophysical interest. To
quantify this qualitative statement, one can start from the current
galactic-dynamo requirements and `reverse engineer' the magnetic strengths
needed at the end of inflation, in order to produce astrophysically relevant
residual seeds today. Our results suggest that, depending on the magnetic
scale, mechanisms of inflationary magnetogenesis generating fields stronger
than $10^{17}$ G by the end of the de Sitter phase, could successfully seed the
galactic dynamo at present.

the mechanical forces of light associated with superradiant scattering into the
cavity mode. It occurs when the laser intensity exceeds a threshold value, such
that the pumping processes counteract the losses. We consider atoms driven by a
laser and coupling with a mode of a standing-wave cavity and describe their
dynamics with a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the atomic motion is
semiclassical but the cavity field is a full quantum variable. The asymptotic
state of the atoms is a thermal state, whose temperature is solely controlled
by the detuning between the laser and the cavity frequency and by the cavity
loss rate. From this result we derive the free energy and show that in the
thermodynamic limit selforganization is a second-order phase transition. The
order parameter is the field inside the resonator, to which one can associate a
magnetization in analogy to ferromagnetism, the control field is the laser
intensity, however the steady state is intrinsically out-of-equilibrium. In the
symmetry-broken phase quantum noise induces jumps of the spatial density
between two ordered patterns: We characterize the statistical properties of
this temporal behaviour at steady state and show that the thermodynamic
properties of the system can be extracted by detecting the light at the cavity
output. The results of our analysis are in full agreement with previous

relatively weak magnetic fields and is manifest in anomalously large
field-induced splittings of quantum dot resonances which are degenerate at
$B=0$ due to time-reversal symmetry. This exotic behavior, which is governed by
field-induced jumps in the Berry phase of confined electronic states, is unique
to quantum dots in Dirac materials and is absent in conventional quantum dots.
The effect is strong for gapless Dirac particles and can overwhelm the
$B$-induced orbital and Zeeman splittings. A finite Dirac mass suppresses the
effect. The nonreciprocity, predicted for generic two-dimensional Dirac
materials, is accessible through Faraday and Kerr optical rotation measurements
and scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

indexes as well as our contributions (which are mostly practice-oriented).
  The first contribution is the FM-bloated index, which is a modification of
the well-known FM-index (a compressed, full-text index) that trades space for
speed. In our approach, the count table and the occurrence lists store
information about selected $q$-grams in addition to the individual characters.
Two variants are described, namely one using $O(n \log^2 n)$ bits of space with
$O(m + \log m \log \log n)$ average query time, and one with linear space and
$O(m \log \log n)$ average query time, where $n$ is the input text length and
$m$ is the pattern length. We experimentally show that a significant speedup
can be achieved by operating on $q$-grams (albeit at the cost of very high
space requirements, hence the name ""bloated"").
  In the category of keyword indexes we present the so-called split index,
which can efficiently solve the $k$-mismatches problem, especially for 1 error.
Our implementation in the C++ language is focused mostly on data compaction,
which is beneficial for the search speed (by being cache friendly). We compare
our solution with other algorithms and we show that it is faster when the
Hamming distance is used. Query times in the order of 1 microsecond were
reported for one mismatch for a few-megabyte natural language dictionary on a
medium-end PC.
  A minor contribution includes string sketches which aim to speed up
approximate string comparison at the cost of additional space ($O(1)$ per
string). They can be used in the context of keyword indexes in order to deduce
that two strings differ by at least $k$ mismatches with the use of fast bitwise
operations rather than an explicit verification.

stars, are associated with nucleonic matter at sub-saturation densities
arranged in regular shapes. Those complex phases, residing in a layer which is
approximately 100 m thick, impact many features of neutron stars. Theoretical
quantum-mechanical simulations of nuclear pasta are usually carried out in
finite 3D boxes assuming periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The resulting
solutions are affected by spurious finite-size effects.
  Purpose: In order to remove spurious finite-size effects, it is convenient to
employ twist-averaged boundary conditions (TABC) used in condensed matter,
nuclear matter, and lattice QCD applications. In this work, we study the
effectiveness of TABC in the context of pasta phases simulations within nuclear
density functional theory.
  Methods: We perform Skyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations in three dimensions by
implementing Bloch boundary conditions. The TABC averages are obtained by means
of Gauss-Legendre integration over twist angles.
  Results: We benchmark the TABC for a free nucleonic gas and apply it to
simple cases such as the rod and slab phases, as well as to more elaborate
P-surface and gyroidal phases.
  Conclusions: We demonstrate that by applying TABC reliable results can be
obtained from calculations performed in relatively small volumes. By studying
various contributions to the total energy, we gain insights into pasta phases
in mid-density range.

specification arises in many practical cases. Unfortunately, known algorithms
for an expressive logic like MTL (Metric Temporal Logic) do not scale with
respect to two crucial dimensions: the length of the trace and the size of the
time interval for which logged events must be buffered to check satisfaction of
the specification. The former issue can be addressed by distributed and
parallel trace checking algorithms that can take advantage of modern cloud
computing and programming frameworks like MapReduce. Still, the latter issue
remains open with current state-of-the-art approaches.
  In this paper we address this memory scalability issue by proposing a new
semantics for MTL, called lazy semantics. This semantics can evaluate temporal
formulae and boolean combinations of temporal-only formulae at any arbitrary
time instant. We prove that lazy semantics is more expressive than standard
point-based semantics and that it can be used as a basis for a correct
parametric decomposition of any MTL formula into an equivalent one with
smaller, bounded time intervals. We use lazy semantics to extend our previous
distributed trace checking algorithm for MTL. We evaluate the proposed
algorithm in terms of memory scalability and time/memory tradeoffs.

radio (CR) networks in which malicious users imitate the primary users (PUs)
signals to limit the access of secondary users (SUs). Ascertaining the identity
of the devices is a key technical challenge that must be overcome to thwart the
threat of PUE attacks. Typically, detection of PUE attacks is done by
inspecting the signals coming from all the devices in the system, and then
using these signals to form unique fingerprints for each device. Current
detection and fingerprinting approaches require certain conditions to hold in
order to effectively detect attackers. Such conditions include the need for a
sufficient amount of fingerprint data for users or the existence of both the
attacker and the victim PU within the same time frame. These conditions are
necessary because current methods lack the ability to learn the behavior of
both SUs and PUs with time. In this paper, a novel transfer learning (TL)
approach is proposed, in which abstract knowledge about PUs and SUs is
transferred from past time frames to improve the detection process at future
time frames. The proposed approach extracts a high level representation for the
environment at every time frame. This high level information is accumulated to
form an abstract knowledge database. The CR system then utilizes this database
to accurately detect PUE attacks even if an insufficient amount of fingerprint
data is available at the current time frame. The dynamic structure of the
proposed approach uses the final detection decisions to update the abstract
knowledge database for future runs. Simulation results show that the proposed
method can improve the performance with an average of 3.5% for only 10%
relevant information between the past knowledge and the current environment
signals.

Poincar\'e rank $k$ at the origin, under analytic equivalence. The modulus of a
given family was determined in \cite{HLR}: it comprises a formal part depending
analytically on the parameters, and an analytic part given by unfoldings of the
Stokes matrices. These unfoldings are given on ""Douady-Sentenac"" (DS) domains
in the parameter space covering the generic values of the parameters
corresponding to Fuchsian singular points. Here we identify exactly which
moduli can be realized. A necessary condition on the analytic part, called
compatibility condition, is saying that the unfoldings define the same
monodromy group (up to conjugacy) for the different presentations of the
modulus on the intersections of DS domains. With the additional requirement
that the corresponding cocycle is trivial and good limit behavior at some
boundary points of the DS domains, this condition becomes sufficient. In
particular we show that any modulus can be realized by a $k$-parameter family
of systems of rational linear differential equations over $\mathbb C\mathbb
P^1$ with $k+1$, $k+2$ or $k+3$ singular points (with multiplicities). Under
the generic condition of irreducibility, there are precisely $k+2$ singular
points which are Fuchsian as soon as simple. This in turn implies that any
unfolding of an irregular singularity of Poincar\'e rank $k$ is analytically
equivalent to a rational system of the form $y'=\frac{A(x)}{p_\epsilon(x)}\cdot

Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) vector and tensor interaction terms, in addition to
the standard RKKY term, so that the net interaction energy has the form: $

  We find that for the spin-polarized electron gas, a non-zero tensor
interaction $\stackrel{\leftrightarrow}{\Gamma}$ is present in addition to the
scalar RKKY interaction $J$, while $\vec D$ is zero due to the presence of
inversion symmetry. Explicit expressions for these are derived for the electron
gas both in 2D and 3D. The RKKY interaction exhibits a beating pattern, caused
by the presence of the two Fermi momenta $k_{F\uparrow}$ and $k_{F\downarrow}$,
while the $R^{-3}$ distance dependence of the original RKKY result for the 3D
electron gas is retained.
  This model serves as a simple example of the magnetic interaction in systems
with broken symmetry, which goes beyond the RKKY interaction.

$\{\rho_1^{\otimes n},\ldots,\rho_r^{\otimes n}\}$, where an arbitrary prior
distribution is given and each of the $r$ hypotheses is $n$ copies of a quantum
state. It is known that the average error probability $P_e$ decays
exponentially to zero, that is, $P_e=\exp\{-\xi n+o(n)\}$. However, this error
exponent $\xi$ is generally unknown, except for the case that $r=2$.
  In this paper, we solve the long-standing open problem of identifying the
above error exponent, by proving Nussbaum and Szko\l a's conjecture that
$\xi=\min_{i\neq j}C(\rho_i,\rho_j)$. The right-hand side of this equality is
called the multiple quantum Chernoff distance, and
$C(\rho_i,\rho_j):=\max_{0\leq s\leq
1}\{-\log\operatorname{Tr}\rho_i^s\rho_j^{1-s}\}$ has been previously
identified as the optimal error exponent for testing two hypotheses,
$\rho_i^{\otimes n}$ versus $\rho_j^{\otimes n}$.
  The main ingredient of our proof is a new upper bound for the average error
probability, for testing an ensemble of finite-dimensional, but otherwise
general, quantum states. This upper bound, up to a states-dependent factor,
matches the multiple-state generalization of Nussbaum and Szko\l a's lower

observatory in very high energy gamma ray astronomy. The facility will achieve
a wide energy coverage, starting from a threshold of a few tens of GeV up to
hundreds of TeV by utilising several classes of telescopes, each optimised for
different regions of the gamma-ray spectrum. The required energy resolution of
better than 10-15% over most of the energy range and a goal of 5% systematic
uncertainty on the measurement of the Cherenkov light intensity at the position
of each telescope means that a very precise evaluation of the entire system
will need to be made. The composite nature of the array means multiple camera
technologies will be employed so multiple calibration systems and procedures
will be necessary to meet the performance requirements. Additional constraints
will come from the need to minimise observing time losses and that the
observatory is foreseen to operate for tens of years, so both short and long
term systematic changes in performance will need to be investigated and
monitored. This contribution summarises the recommended camera calibration
strategy of CTA based on the experience with current IACTs.

775; the observed white qi phenomenon that happened ""above the moon"" in the

improved cooling models, we measure for the first time the radial temperature

Stable burning could create the required carbon, but this was predicted to only
occur at much larger accretion rates than where superbursts are observed. We
present models of a new steady-state regime of stable hydrogen and helium
burning that produces pure carbon ashes. Hot CNO burning of hydrogen heats the
neutron star envelope and causes helium to burn before the conditions of a
helium flash are reached. This takes place when the mass accretion rate is
around 10% of the Eddington limit: close to the rate where most superbursts

steady-state burning by steepening the temperature profile, which increases the

be crucial for a very strong near-resonant decay phenomenon leading to the
quasiparticle breakdown in the kagom\'{e}-lattice antiferromagnets whose

persist even in the limit of large spin values and should be common to other

radiation pressure as shown to be the case for evaporating hot Jupiters.
Instead, the low radiation pressure from the M-dwarf host star only brakes the
gravitational fall of the escaping hydrogen toward the star and allows its
dispersion within a large volume around the planet, yielding radial velocities

interpretation for anomalous peak signatures in cosmic ray measurements,
assuming an extended dark sector with two DM species. This is contrasted with
previous effort to explain various line-like cosmic-ray excesses in the context
of DM models where the relevant DM candidate directly annihilates into Standard
Model (SM) particles. The heavier DM is assumed to annihilate to an on-shell
intermediate state. As the simplest choice, it decays directly into the lighter
DM along with an unstable particle which in turn decays to a pair of SM states
corresponding to the interesting cosmic anomaly. We show that a sharp continuum
energy peak can be readily generated under the proposed DM scenario, depending
on dark sector particle mass spectra. Remarkably, such a peak is robustly
identified as half the mass of the unstable particle. Furthermore, other
underlying mass parameters are analytically related to the shape of energy
spectrum. We apply this idea to the two well-known line excesses in the cosmic
photon spectrum: 130 GeV gamma-ray line and 3.5 keV X-ray line. Each observed
peak spectrum is well-reproduced by theoretical expectation predicated upon our
suggested mechanism, and moreover, our resulting best fits provide rather
improved chi-square values.

M-theory lift of this system to compute the real Gopakumar-Vafa invariants
(describing wrapped M2-brane BPS states) for diverse geometries. We show that
the real topological string amplitudes pick up certain signs across flop
transitions, in a well-defined pattern consistent with continuity of the real
BPS invariants. We further give some preliminary proposals of an intrinsically
gauge theoretical description of the effect of the surface operator in the
gauge theory partition function.

more self-consistent understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) on small

(magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of the ISM in a vertically stratified box
including self-gravity, an external potential due to the stellar component of
the galactic disc, and stellar feedback in the form of an interstellar
radiation field and supernovae (SNe). The cooling of the gas is based on a
chemical network that follows the abundances of H+, H, H2, C+, and CO and takes
shielding into account consistently. We vary the SN feedback by comparing
different SN rates, clustering and different positioning, in particular SNe in
density peaks and at random positions, which has a major impact on the
dynamics. Only for random SN positions the energy is injected in sufficiently
low-density environments to reduce energy losses and enhance the effective
kinetic coupling of the SNe with the gas. This leads to more realistic velocity
dispersions (\sigma_HI ~ 0.8\sigma_(300-8000K) ~ 10-20km/s, \sigma_H\alpha ~
0.6\sigma_(8000-3e5K) ~ 20-30km/s), and strong outflows with mass loading

the onset of outflows compared to individual SNe but do not influence the net
outflow rate. The outflows do not contain any molecular gas and are mainly
composed of atomic hydrogen. The bulk of the outflowing mass is dense (\rho ~
1e-25-1e-24g/cc) and slow (v ~ 20-40km/s) but there is a high-velocity tail of

dark matter halo. Our fits to the observed stream properties (streak and radial
velocity gradient) result in a preference for a relatively large Pal 5 distance

In this work, we have performed fully \textit{ab initio} calculations of the
surface band structures of these four WSM materials and revealed the Fermi arcs
with spin-momentum-locked spin texture. On the (001) polar surface, the shape
of the Fermi surface depends sensitively on the surface terminations (cations
or anions), although they exhibit the same topology with arcs. The anion (P or
As) terminated surfaces are found to fit recent photoemission measurements
well. Such surface potential dependence indicates that the shape of the Fermi
surface can be manipulated by depositing guest species (such as K atoms), as we
demonstrate. On the polar surface of a WSM without inversion symmetry,
Rashba-type spin polarization naturally exists in the surface states and leads
to strong spin texture. By tracing the spin polarization of the Fermi surface,
we can also distinguish Fermi arcs from trivial Fermi circles. The four
compounds NbP, NbAs, TaP, and TaAs present an increasing amplitude of
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the band structure. By comparing their surface
states, we reveal the evolution of topological Fermi arcs from the
spin-degenerate Fermi circle to spin-split arcs when the SOC increases from
zero to a finite value. Our work will help us understand the complicated
surface states of WSMs and allow us to manipulate them, especially for future

Measure (RM) synthesis to unravel the distribution of polarized structures in
Faraday depth. The brightness temperature of the detected Galactic emission is
$5-15~{\rm K}$ in polarized intensity and covers the range from -3 to +8 ${\rm
rad~m^{-2}}$ in Faraday depth. The most interesting morphological feature is a
strikingly straight filament at a Faraday depth of $+0.5~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$
running from north to south, right through the centre of the field and parallel
to the Galactic plane. There is also an interesting system of linear
depolarization canals conspicuous in an image showing the peaks of Faraday
spectra. We used the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at 350 MHz to
image the same region. For the first time, we see some common morphology in the

emission in total intensity in the interferometric data, in line with results
at higher frequencies and previous LOFAR observations. Based on our results, we
determined physical parameters of the ISM and proposed a simple model that may
explain the observed distribution of the intervening magneto-ionic medium. The
mean line-of-sight magnetic field component, $B_\parallel$, is determined to be
$0.3\pm0.1~{\rm \mu G}$ and its spatial variation across the 3C196 field is

many earlier studies, which were often focused on determining the elongation
limits due to (1) natural elongation in a simple applied pure vertical field or
(2) axisymmetric stability in the presence of a perfectly conducting wall. The
extension investigated here includes the effect of the vertical stability
feedback system which actually sets the maximum practical elongation limit in a
real experiment. A basic resistive wall stability parameter (gammatau) is
introduced to model the feedback system which although simple in appearance
actually captures the essence of the feedback system. Elongation limits in the
presence of feedback are then determined by calculating the maximum elongation
against n=0 resistive wall modes for fixed gammatau. The results are obtained
by means of a general formulation culminating in a variational principle which
is particularly amenable to numerical analysis. The principle is valid for
arbitrary profiles but simplifies significantly for the Solov'ev profiles,
effectively reducing the 2-D stability problem into a 1-D problem. The
accompanying paper provides the numerical results and leads to a sharp answer
of how much elongation is too much?

for numerical analysis. A fast and accurate code has been written using this
numerical formulation. The results are presented by first defining a reference
set of physical parameters based on experimental data from high performance
discharges. Numerically obtained scaling relations of maximum achievable
elongation versus inverse aspect ratio are obtained for various values of
poloidal beta, wall radius and feedback capability parameter in ranges near the
reference values. It is also shown that each value of maximum elongation occurs
at a corresponding value of optimized triangularity, whose scaling is also
determined as a function of inverse aspect ratio. The results show that the
theoretical predictions of maximum elongation are slightly higher than
experimental observations for high performance discharges as measured by high
average pressure. The theoretical optimized triangularity values are noticeably
lower. We suggest that the explanation is associated with the observation that
high performance involves not only MHD considerations, but also transport as
characterized by confinement time. Operation away from the MHD optimum may
still lead to higher performance if there are more than compensatory gains in
the confinement time. Unfortunately, while the empirical scaling of the
confinement time with the elongation has been determined, the dependence on the
triangularity has still not been quantified. This information is needed in
order to perform more accurate overall optimizations in future experimental
designs.

again motivated by real-world applications, we relax the usual assumption that
the graphon is defined on the unit interval, to allow latent position graphs

identifiability for these graphons and their underlying position spaces.

gives an approximation we prove to be consistent for all square-integrable
graphons, with errors expressed in terms of the best possible stochastic block
model approximation to the generating graphon. Next, we analyze a
generalization based on the cut norm, which works for any integrable graphon
(not necessarily square-integrable). Finally, we show that clustering based on
degrees works whenever the underlying degree distribution is atomless. Unlike

gauge symmetry and a continuous R symmetry. We select two types of Kahler
potentials, which respect these symmetries as well as an approximate shift
symmetry. In particular, they include in a logarithm a dominant shift-symmetric
term proportional to a parameter c- together with a small term violating this
symmetry and characterized by a parameter c+. In both cases, imposing a lower
bound on c-, inflation can be attained with subplanckian values of the original
inflaton, while the corresponding effective theory respects perturbative
unitarity for r+-=c+/c-<1. These inflationary models do not lead to
overproduction of cosmic defects, are largely independent of the one-loop
radiative corrections and accommodate, for natural values of r+-, observable
gravitational waves consistently with all the current observational data. The
inflaton mass is mostly confined in the range (3.7-8.1)x10^10 GeV.

($i=x,y,z)$ is a $p_i$-wave pairing interaction). This type of interaction is
considered to be realized in a $^{40}$K Fermi gas. Including pairing
fluctuations within a strong-coupling $T$-matrix theory, we determine the
$p_x$-wave superfluid phase transition temperature $T^{p_x}_{\rm c}$, as well
as the other phase transition temperature $T_{\rm c}^{p_x+ip_y}$ ($<T_{\rm
c}^{p_x}$), below which the superfluid order parameter has the $p_x+ip_y$-wave
symmetry. In the normal state near $T^{p_x}_{\rm c}$, $p_x$-wave pairing
fluctuations are shown to induce an anisotropic pseudogap phenomenon, where a
dip structure in the angle-resolved density of states around $\omega=0$ is the
most remarkable in the $p_x$ direction. In the $p_x$-wave superfluid phase
($T_{\rm c}^{p_x+ip_y}<T\le T_{\rm c}^{p_x}$), while the pseudogap in the $p_x$
direction continuously changes to the superfluid gap, the pseudogap in the
perpendicular direction to the $p_x$ axis is found to continue developing,
because of enhanced $p_y$-wave and $p_z$-wave pairing fluctuations around the
node of the $p_x$-wave superfluid order parameter. Since pairing fluctuations
are always suppressed in the isotropic $s$-wave superfluid state, this
phenomenon is peculiar to an unconventional Fermi superfluid with a nodal
superfluid order parameter. Since the $p$-wave Fermi superfluid is the most
promising non $s$-wave pairing state in an ultracold Fermi gas, our results
would contribute to understanding how the anisotropic pairing fluctuations, as
well as the existence of plural superfluid phases, affect many-body properties
of this unconventional Fermi superfluid.

hand-in-hand with shorter-lived nuclei produced in smaller abundances than
their more stable counterparts. The measurement, to high precision, of nuclear
masses therefore requires innovations in technique in order to keep up.
TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility deploys three
ion traps, with a fourth in the commissioning phase, to perform and support
Penning trap mass spectrometry and in-trap decay spectroscopy on some of the
shortest-lived nuclei ever studied. We report on recent advances and updates to
the TITAN facility since the 2012 EMIS Conference.
  TITAN's charge breeding capabilities have been improved and in-trap decay
spectroscopy can be performed in TITAN's electron beam ion trap (EBIT). Higher
charge states can improve the precision of mass measurements, reduce the
beam-time requirements for a given measurement, improve beam purity and opens
the door to access, via in-trap decay and recapture, isotopes not available
from the ISOL method. This was recently demonstrated during TITAN's mass
measurement of $^{30}$Al. The EBIT's decay spectroscopy setup was commissioned
with a successful branching ratio and half-life measurement of $^{124}$Cs.
  Charge breeding in the EBIT increases the energy spread of the ion bunch sent
to the Penning trap for mass measurement so a new Cooler Penning Trap (CPET),
which aims to cool highly charge ions with an electron plasma, is undergoing
online commissioning. Already, CPET has demonstrated the trapping and
self-cooling of a room-temperature electron plasma which was stored for several
minutes. A new detector has been installed inside the CPET magnetic field which
will allow for in-magnet charged particle detection.

quasiparticles, arising from the strong coupling between confined light modes
in a resonant planar optical cavity and excitonic transitions, typically using
excitons in semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) placed at the antinodes of the
same cavity. Quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC),
quantized vortices, and macroscopic quantum states have been reported at
temperatures from tens of Kelvin up to room temperatures, and polaritonic
devices such as spin switches \cite{Amo2010} and optical transistors have also
been reported. Many of these effects of exciton-polaritons depend crucially on
the polariton-polariton interaction strength. Despite the importance of this
parameter, it has been difficult to make an accurate experimental measurement,
mostly because of the difficulty of determining the absolute densities of
polaritons and bare excitons. Here we report the direct measurement of the
polariton-polariton interaction strength in a very high-Q microcavity
structure. By allowing polaritons to propagate over 40 $\mu$m to the center of
a laser-generated annular trap, we are able to separate the polariton-polariton
interactions from polariton-exciton interactions. The interaction strength is
deduced from the energy renormalization of the polariton dispersion as the
polariton density is increased, using the polariton condensation as a benchmark
for the density. We find that the interaction strength is about two orders of
magnitude larger than previous theoretical estimates, putting polaritons
squarely into the strongly-interacting regime. When there is a condensate, we
see a sharp transition to a different dependence of the renormalization on the
density, which is evidence of many-body effects.

HCO$^+$ emission lines, including maps of the HCN $J=8-7$ and HCO$^+$ $J=9-8$
transitions. The excitation conditions of $^{12}$CO, HCO$^+$ and HCN are
estimated with a two-phase non-LTE radiative transfer model of the line
spectral energy distributions (LSEDs) at four selected positions. The energy
balance at these positions is also studied. We obtained extensive LSEDs for the
CO, HCN and HCO$^+$ molecules toward M17 SW. The LSED shape, particularly the
high-$J$ tail of the CO lines observed with SOFIA/GREAT, is distinctive for the
underlying excitation conditions. The critical magnetic field criterion implies
that the cold cloudlets at two positions are partially controlled by processes
that create and dissipate internal motions. Supersonic but sub-Alfv\'enic
velocities in the cold component at most selected positions indicates that
internal motions are likely MHD waves. Magnetic pressure dominates thermal
pressure in both gas components at all selected positions, assuming random
orientation of the magnetic field. The magnetic pressure of a constant magnetic
field throughout all the gas phases can support the total internal pressure of
the cold components, but it cannot support the internal pressure of the warm
components. If the magnetic field scales as $B \propto n^{2/3}$, then the
evolution of the cold cloudlets at two selected positions, and the warm
cloudlets at all selected positions, will be determined by ambipolar diffusion.

However, in a single-band model, they are considerably canceled by the
contribution from the Meissner surface current in a layer with the width of the
penetration depth $\lambda$, making it difficult to observe them
experimentally. In the case of multi-band metals with both electron-like and
hole-like bands, however, considerable cancellation still occurs for the IMM

the effect of the Meissner current becomes less important. As an example of a

little is known about the precise relationship between these disciplines--and

  In this paper, we compare L and K, two classes of deadlock-free, session
typed concurrent processes. The class L stands out for its canonicity: it
results naturally from interpretations of linear logic propositions as session
types. The class K, obtained by encoding session types into Kobayashi's usage
types, includes processes not typable in other type systems.
  We show that L is strictly included in K. We also identify the precise
condition under which L and K coincide. One key observation is that the degree
of sharing between parallel processes determines a new expressiveness hierarchy
for typed processes. We also provide a type-preserving rewriting procedure of
processes in K into processes in L. This procedure suggests that, while
effective, the degree of sharing is a rather subtle criteria for distinguishing
typed processes.

combinatory calculus containing a special combinator, F, which is able to
examine the internal structure of its first argument. The calculus is
significant in that as well as being combinatorially complete it also exhibits
the property of structural completeness, i.e. it is able to represent any
function on terms definable using pattern matching on arbitrary normal forms.
In particular, it admits a term that can decide the structural equality of any
two arbitrary normal forms.
  Since SF-calculus is combinatorially complete, it is clearly at least as
powerful as the more familiar and paradigmatic Turing-powerful computational
models of Lambda Calculus and Combinatory Logic. Its relationship to these
models in the converse direction is less obvious, however. Jay and Given-Wilson
have suggested that SF-calculus is strictly more powerful than the
aforementioned models, but a detailed study of the connections between these
models is yet to be undertaken.
  This paper begins to bridge that gap by presenting a faithful encoding of the
Factorisation Calculus into the Lambda Calculus preserving both reduction and
strong normalisation. The existence of such an encoding is a new result. It
also suggests that there is, in some sense, an equivalence between the former
model and the latter. We discuss to what extent our result constitutes an
equivalence by considering it in the context of some previously defined

variants associated with diseases. To control false positives, all findings

method by using independent samples. An association is regarded as true
positive with a high confidence when it can be identified in both primary study

of positives in the replication study when the positive results of primary
study are considered as the prior information.
  In this paper, two probabilistic measures named Reproducibility Rate (RR) and
False Irreproducibility Rate (FIR) are proposed to quantitatively describe the
behavior of primary positive associations (i.e. positive associations
identified in the primary study) in the replication study. RR is a conditional
probability measuring how likely a primary positive association will also be
positive in the replication study. This can be used to guide the design of
replication study, and to check the consistency between the results of primary
study and those of replication study. FIR, on the contrary, measures how likely
a primary positive association may still be a true positive even when it is
negative in the replication study. This can be used to generate a list of
potentially true associations in the irreproducible findings for further
scrutiny. The estimation methods of these two measures are given. Simulation

demonstrate that this scaling holds true over a large range of packing

sequence to a group of partially connected cooperative wireless devices using
instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). In such a scenario, the coding
conflicts occur to service multiple devices with an immediately decodable
packet and the transmission conflicts occur from simultaneous transmissions of
multiple devices. To avoid these conflicts, we introduce a novel IDNC graph
that represents all feasible coding and transmission conflict-free decisions in
one unified framework. Moreover, a real-time video sequence has a hard deadline
and unequal importance of video packets. Using these video characteristics and
the new IDNC graph, we formulate the problem of minimizing the mean video
distortion before the deadline as a finite horizon Markov decision process
(MDP) problem. However, the backward induction algorithm that finds the optimal
policy of the MDP formulation has high modelling and computational
complexities. To reduce these complexities, we further design a two-stage
maximal independent set selection algorithm, which can efficiently reduce the
mean video distortion before the deadline. Simulation results over a real video
sequence show that our proposed IDNC algorithms improve the received video
quality compared to the existing IDNC algorithms.

understanding the properties of magnetic relativistic insulators, mediated by
the strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling. One of the most fundamental issues is to
which extent these properties can be described by the superexchange (SE) model,
formulated in the limit of the large Coulomb repulsion. In the present work we
address this issue by deriving the relevant models and extracting parameters of
these models from the first-principles calculations. First, we construct the
effective Hubbard-type model for the t2g bands, by recasting the problem in the
language of Wannier orbitals. Then, we map the obtained electron model onto the
pseudospin model by applying the theory of SE interactions. We discuss the
microscopic origin of anisotropic SE interactions, inherent to the compass
Heisenberg model, and the appearance of the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
term, associated with the additional rotation of the IrO6 octahedra in Sr2IrO4.
In order to evaluate the Neel temperature (TN), we employ the non-linear sigma
model. While for Sr2IrO4 our value of TN agrees with the experimental one, for
Ba2IrO4 it is overestimated by a factor two. We argue that this discrepancy is
related to limitations of the SE model: while for more localized t2g states in
Sr2IrO4 it works reasonably well, the higher-order terms, beyond the SE model,
play a more important role in the more ""itinerant"" Ba2IrO4, giving rise to the
new type of isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions. This conclusion is
supported by unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations for the same electron
model, where in the case of Ba2IrO4, already on the mean-field level, we were
able to reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic ground state, while for
Sr2IrO4 the main results are essentially the same as in the SE model.

We employ the maximum-entropy principle to deduce an initial system- bath state
consistent with the available information. For the generic case of weak

quantity in a generic network of interacting agents. Here, we present a
probabilistic framework for diffusion in networks and propose to classify agent
interactions according to two protocols where the total network quantity is
conserved or variable. For both protocols, our focus is on asymmetric
interactions between agents involving directed graphs. Specifically, we define
how the dynamics of conservative and non-conservative networks relate to the
weighted in-degree Laplacian and the weighted out-degree Laplacian. Our
framework allows the addition and subtraction of the considered quantity to and
from a set of nodes. This enables the modeling of stubborn agents with
time-invariant quantities, and the process of dynamic learning. We highlight
several stability and convergence characteristics of our framework, and define
the conditions under which asymptotic convergence is guaranteed when the
network topology is variable. In addition, we indicate how our framework
accommodates external network control and targeted network design. We show how
network diffusion can be externally manipulated by applying time-varying input
functions at individual nodes. Desirable network structures can also be
constructed by adjusting the dominant diffusion modes. To this purpose, we
propose a Markov decision process that learns these network adjustments through
a reinforcement learning algorithm, suitable for large networks. The presented
network control and design schemes enable flow modifications that allow the
alteration of the dynamic and stationary behavior of the network in
conservative and non-conservative networks.

sources are to be scaled for industrial processes. Ideally, the discharge
parameters of the scaled plasmas are predictable and the fundamental physical
processes are unaltered. Naturally, there are limitations and ranges of
validity. Scaling laws for direct current glow discharges are well known. If a
well diagnosed discharge is scaled, the field strength in the positive column,
the gas amplification and the normal current density can easily be estimated.
For non-stationary high power discharges like high power impulse magnetron
sputtering (HiPIMS) plasmas, scaling is not as straight forward. Here, one
deals with a non-stationary complex system with strong changes in plasma
chemistry and symmetry breaks during the pulses. Because of the huge parameter
space no good parameters are available to define these kind of discharges
unambiguous at the moment. In this contribution we will discuss the scaling
laws for DC glow discharges briefly and present experimental results for a
discharge with copper electrodes and helium as plasma forming gas. This
discharge was operated in a pressure range from 200 to 1600 hPa with three
different electrode diameters (D=2.1, 3.0 and 4.3 mm). Results from breakdown
voltage measurements indicate that the pressure and electrode distance cannot
be varied independently. Effects of the scaling on the reduced normal current
density, the reduced normal electric field in the positive column and discharge
temperature will be discussed and limitations highlighted. Compared with these
results the added complexity of HiPIMS plasmas will be described. Suggestions
in the community how to obtain experimental finger prints of the plasmas will
be reviewed and implications from the experiences with DC discharges on the
development of similarity laws for HiPIMS plasmas will be discussed.

of 14-C around AD 775. Our method is to compare the 14-C variation around AD
775 with other periods of strong variability. Our results are: (a) We see three
periods, where 14-C varied over 200 yr in a special way showing a certain
pattern of strong secular variation: after a Grand Minimum with strongly
increasing 14-C, there is a series of strong short-term drop(s), rise(s), and
again drop(s) within 60 yr, ending up to 200 yr after the start of the Grand
Minimum. These three periods include the strong rises around BC 671, AD 775,
and AD 1795. (b) We show with several solar activity proxies (radioisotopes,
sunspots, and aurorae) for the AD 770s and 1790s that such intense rapid 14-C
increases can be explained by strong rapid decreases in solar activity and,
hence, wind, so that the decrease in solar modulation potential leads to an
increase in radioisotope production. (c) The strong rises around AD 775 and
1795 are due to three effects, (i) very strong activity in the previous cycles
(i.e. very low 14-C level), (ii) the declining phase of a very strong Schwabe
cycle, and (iii) a phase of very weak activity after the strong 14-C rise --
very short and/or weak cycle(s) like the suddenly starting Dalton minimum. (d)
Furthermore, we can show that the strong change at AD 1795 happened after a
pair of two packages of four Schwabe cycles with certain hemispheric leadership
(each package consists of two Gnevyshev-Ohl pairs, respectively two
Hale-Babcock pairs). We show with several additional arguments that the rise
around AD 775 was not that special. ...

efficiency (EE) for multiple input single output interfering broadcast channels
(IFBC). Under this model, the EE problem is non-convex in general due to the
coupled interference and its fractional form, and thus it is difficult to solve
the problem. Conventional algorithms which address this problem have adopted an
iterative method for each channel realization, which requires high
computational complexity. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we
parameterize the beamforming vector by scalar parameters related to beam
direction and power. Then, by employing asymptotic results of random matrix
theory with this parametrization, we identify the optimal parameters to
maximize the EE in the large system limit assuming that the number of transmit
antennas and users are large with a fixed ratio. In the asymptotic regime, our
solutions depend only on the second order channel statistics, which yields
significantly reduced computational complexity and system overhead compared to
the conventional approaches. Hence, the beamforming vector to maximize the EE
performance can be determined with local channel state information and the
optimized parameters. Based on the asymptotic results, the proposed scheme can
provide insights on the average EE performance, and a simple yet efficient
beamforming strategy is introduced for the finite system case. Numerical
results confirm that the proposed scheme shows a negligible performance loss
compared to the best result achieved by the conventional approaches even with
small system dimensions, with much reduced system complexity.

ring of non-touching glass elements whose modes are tailored to ensure resonant
phase-matched coupling to higher-order core modes, causing them to leak at a
very high rate into the supporting solid glass sheath. Using a model based on
coupled capillary waveguides, as well as full vectorial finite element
modelling, we show that this modal filtering effect depends on only one
dimensionless geometrical parameter, akin to the well-known $d/{\Lambda}$
parameter for endlessly single-mode solid-core PCF. The design is scalable up
to large core sizes and is predicted to deliver LP$_{01}$ mode losses of some
$10$s of dB/km in multiple transmission windows, the broadest of which spans
more than an octave. At the same time, higher order core modes have losses that
are typically $1000$s of times higher than the LP$_{01}$ mode. The fibre is of
great potential interest in applications such as high-power laser beam
delivery, gas-based nonlinear optics, laser particle delivery, chemical sensing

science. Astrophysics is not an exception and is now facing a deluge of data.
For galaxies, the one-century old Hubble classification and the Hubble tuning
fork are still largely in use, together with numerous mono-or bivariate
classifications most often made by eye. However, a classification must be
driven by the data, and sophisticated multivariate statistical tools are used
more and more often. In this paper we review these different approaches in
order to situate them in the general context of unsupervised and supervised
learning. We insist on the astrophysical outcomes of these studies to show that
multivariate analyses provide an obvious path toward a renewal of our
classification of galaxies and are invaluable tools to investigate the physics
and evolution of galaxies.

because the momentum map is not proper and the ensuing symplectic (or

holomorphic polarisation. We then define the quantization of the singular
quotient T*G/Ad G$ as the kernel of the (twisted) Dolbeault-Dirac operator on

presence of a mean-field coupling and a dispersion of their natural
frequencies. In spite of the analogies with the Kuramoto setup, a much richer
scenario is observed. The ""synchronised phase"", which emerges upon increasing
the coupling strength, is characterized by highly-irregular fluctuations: a
time-series analysis reveals that the dynamics of the order parameter is indeed
high-dimensional. The complex dynamics appears to be the result of the
non-perturbative action of a suitably shaped phase-response curve. Such
mechanism differs from the often invoked balance between excitation and
inhibition and might provide an alternative basis to account for the
self-sustained brain activity in the resting state. The potential interest of
this dynamical regime is further strengthened by its (microscopic) linear
stability, which makes it quite suited for computational tasks. The overall
study has been performed by combining analytical and numerical studies,
starting from the linear stability analysis of the asynchronous regime, to
include the Fourier analysis of the Kuramoto order parameter, the computation
of various types of Lyapunov exponents, and a microscopic study of the
inter-spike intervals.

projects from a fixed set P. Each project k is characterized by a valuation
function; v_k(S) is the value generated by a set S of agents working on project
k. We study the following classic problem in this setting: ""how should the
agents divide the value that they collectively create?"". One traditional
approach in cooperative game theory is to study core stability with the
implicit assumption that there are infinite copies of one project, and agents
can partition themselves into any number of coalitions. In contrast, we
consider a model with a finite number of non-identical projects; this makes
computing both high-welfare solutions and core payments highly non-trivial.
  The main contribution of this paper is a black-box mechanism that reduces the
problem of computing a near-optimal core stable solution to the purely
algorithmic problem of welfare maximization; we apply this to compute an
approximately core stable solution that extracts one-fourth of the optimal
social welfare for the class of subadditive valuations. We also show much
stronger results for several popular sub-classes: anonymous, fractionally
subadditive, and submodular valuations, as well as provide new approximation
algorithms for welfare maximization with anonymous functions. Finally, we

which is chosen arbitrarily from a finite set $\Sigma$. The system must
converge toward a consensus state in which all, or almost all nodes, hold the
same opinion. Moreover, this opinion should be \emph{valid}, i.e., it should be
one among those initially present in the system. This condition should be met
even in the presence of an adaptive, malicious adversary who can modify the
opinions of a bounded number of nodes in every round.
  We consider the \emph{3-majority dynamics}: At every round, every node pulls
the opinion from three random neighbors and sets his new opinion to the
majority one (ties are broken arbitrarily). Let $k$ be the number of valid
opinions. We show that, if $k \leqslant n^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is a
suitable positive constant, the 3-majority dynamics converges in time
polynomial in $k$ and $\log n$ with high probability even in the presence of an
adversary who can affect up to $o(\sqrt{n})$ nodes at each round.

first appeared at 08:00 UT, November 07, near the surface, gradually rose
upwards with the mean speed of $\sim$ 1.5 km s$^{-1}$ and persisted over 30 hr.
Time-distance plots show two patterns of quasi-periodic transverse
displacements of the tornado axis with periods of 40 and 50 minute at different
phases of the tornado evolution. The first pattern occurred during the rising
phase and can be explained by the upward motion of the twisted tornado. The
second pattern occurred during the later stage of evolution when the tornado
already stopped rising and could be caused either by MHD kink waves in the
tornado or by the rotation of two tornado threads around a common axis. The
later hypothesis is supported by the fact that the tornado sometimes showed a
double structure during the quasi-periodic phase. 211 and 193 {\AA} spectral
lines show a coronal cavity above the prominence/tornado, which started
expansion at $\sim$ 13:00 UT and continuously rose above the solar limb. The
tornado finally became unstable and erupted together with the corresponding
prominence as coronal mass ejection (CME) at 15:00 UT, November 08. The final
stage of the evolution of the cavity and the tornado-related prominence
resembles the magnetic breakout model. On the other hand, the kink instability
may destabilize the twisted tornado, and consequently prominence tornadoes can
be used as precursors for CMEs.

better performance by running portions of code on the most appropriate hardware
resource. Currently, significant engineering efforts are undertaken in order to
enable existing programming languages to perform heterogeneous execution mainly
on GPUs. In this paper we describe Jacc, an experimental framework which allows
developers to program GPGPUs directly from Java. By using the Jacc framework,
developers have the ability to add GPGPU support into their applications with
minimal code refactoring.
  To simplify the development of GPGPU applications we allow developers to
model heterogeneous code using two key abstractions: \textit{tasks}, which
encapsulate all the information needed to execute code on a GPGPU; and
\textit{task graphs}, which capture the inter-task control-flow of the
application. Using this information the Jacc runtime is able to automatically
handle data movement and synchronization between the host and the GPGPU;
eliminating the need for explicitly managing disparate memory spaces.
  In order to generate highly parallel GPGPU code, Jacc provides developers
with the ability to decorate key aspects of their code using annotations. The
compiler, in turn, exploits this information in order to automatically generate
code without requiring additional code refactoring.
  Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of Jacc, both in terms of
programmability and performance, by evaluating it against existing Java
frameworks. Experimental results show an average performance speedup of 32x and
a 4.4x code decrease across eight evaluated benchmarks on a NVIDIA Tesla K20m

designed and developed by a consortium of Polish and Swiss institutions and
proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory. The main purpose
of the optical system is to focus the Cherenkov light emitted by extensive air
showers in the atmosphere onto the focal plane detectors. The main component of
the system is a dish consisting of 18 hexagonal mirrors with a total effective
collection area of 6.47 m2 (including the shadowing and estimated mirror
reflectivity). Such a solution was chosen taking into account the analysis of
the Cherenkov light propagation and based on optical simulations. The proper
curvature and stability of the dish is ensured by the mirror alignment system
and the isostatic interface to the telescope structure. Here we present the
design of the optical subsystem together with the performance measurements of
its components.

with a large field of view and a sensitive CCD camera that together ensure
precise atmospheric characterization over the complete field-of-view of the

the field of view of the CTA without interfering with the observation (unlike
laser-based methods). This allows FRAM to operate with high temporal resolution
and provide both real-time data for on-the-fly scheduling decisions and an
offline database for calibration and selection of scientific data. The fast
robotic mount of the telescope supports quick observation of multiple fields
when the array is split and even a check of the conditions in the directions of
the upcoming observations is possible. The FRAM concept is built upon
experience gained with a similar device operated at the Pierre Auger

black-box optimizers like evolutionary algorithms and serves as an inspiration
for the design of new genetic algorithms. Several black-box models covering
different classes of algorithms exist, each highlighting a different aspect of
the algorithms under considerations. In this work we add to the existing
black-box notions a new \emph{elitist black-box model}, in which algorithms are
required to base all decisions solely on (a fixed number of) the best search
points sampled so far. Our model combines features of the ranking-based and the
memory-restricted black-box models with elitist selection.
  We provide several examples for which the elitist black-box complexity is
exponentially larger than that the respective complexities in all previous
black-box models, thus showing that the elitist black-box complexity can be
much closer to the runtime of typical evolutionary algorithms.
  We also introduce the concept of $p$-Monte Carlo black-box complexity, which
measures the time it takes to optimize a problem with failure probability at
most $p$. Even for small~$p$, the $p$-Monte Carlo black-box complexity of a
function class $\mathcal F$ can be smaller by an exponential factor than its
typically regarded Las Vegas complexity (which measures the \emph{expected}
time it takes to optimize $\mathcal F$).

of prey, is one of the hallmarks of perception. On an abstract, algorithmic
level, nonlinear Bayesian filtering, i.e. the estimation of temporally changing
signals based on the history of observations, provides a mathematical framework
for dynamic perception in real time. Since the general, nonlinear filtering
problem is analytically intractable, particle filters are considered among the
most powerful approaches to approximating the solution numerically. Yet, these
algorithms prevalently rely on importance weights, and thus it remains an
unresolved question how the brain could implement such an inference strategy
with a neuronal population. Here, we propose the Neural Particle Filter (NPF),
a weight-less particle filter that can be interpreted as the neuronal dynamics
of a recurrently connected neural network that receives feed-forward input from
sensory neurons and represents the posterior probability distribution in terms
of samples. Specifically, this algorithm bridges the gap between the
computational task of online state estimation and an implementation that allows
networks of neurons in the brain to perform nonlinear Bayesian filtering. The
model captures not only the properties of temporal and multisensory integration
according to Bayesian statistics, but also allows online learning with a
maximum likelihood approach. With an example from multisensory integration, we
demonstrate that the numerical performance of the model is adequate to account
for both filtering and identification problems. Due to the weightless approach,
our algorithm alleviates the 'curse of dimensionality' and thus outperforms
conventional, weighted particle filters in higher dimensions for a limited
number of particles.

improved after being calcined at 500 {\deg}C in high-pressure oxygen.
Furthermore, the mobility was greatly increased by calcining SnO2 PNS at 350
{\deg}C for 12 h in high-pressure oxygen, and the highest mobility reached 35
cm2/Vs. On the other hand, the complex impedance spectra of the samples
revealed that the annihilation of oxygen vacancies mainly happens within the
interfacial region among SnO2 nanoparticles during the calcinations process in
high-pressure oxygen. As a result, the interfacial crystallinity was improved
and carrier mobility was increased. Based on the analysis of experimental data,
a simple model was proposed to explain the above phenomena. And the simple
model may find applications in improving the carrier mobility of other oxide
semiconductors used in photovoltaic cells.

uses E-matching to generate instances incrementally during the search,
significantly reducing the number of generated instances compared to eager

but, nevertheless, the electroweak symmetry breaking is realized by the bosonic
seesaw mechanism. Analyzing the renormalization group evolutions for all model
couplings, we find that a large hierarchy among the quartic Higgs couplings,
which is crucial for the bosonic seesaw mechanism to work, is dramatically
reduced toward high energies. Therefore, the bosonic seesaw is naturally
realized with only a mild hierarchy, if some fundamental theory, which provides
the origin of the classically conformal invariance, completes our model at some
high energy, for example, the Planck scale. We identify the regions of model

equivalent to ~7% of our instrumental resolution, for 95% of our data. Then, we

as it propagates away from the resonances. On the other hand, the excitation of
the $g$-modes is stronger. As they propagate, they channel to the top of disk
atmosphere and their group velocities decrease. The differences compared to
previous studies may have implications in understanding the wave dynamics in a
realistic disk structure.

for generating confusing type error messages. When the compiler detects a type
error, it typically reports the program location where the type checking failed
as the source of the error. Since other error sources are not even considered,
the actual root cause is often missed. A more adequate approach is to consider
all possible error sources and report the most useful one subject to some
usefulness criterion. In our previous work, we showed that this approach can be
formulated as an optimization problem related to satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). This formulation cleanly separates the heuristic nature of usefulness
criteria from the underlying search problem. Unfortunately, algorithms that
search for an optimal error source cannot directly use principal types which
are crucial for dealing with the exponential-time complexity of the decision
problem of polymorphic type checking. In this paper, we present a new algorithm
that efficiently finds an optimal error source in a given ill-typed program.
Our algorithm uses an improved SMT encoding to cope with the high complexity of
polymorphic typing by iteratively expanding the typing constraints from which
principal types are derived. The algorithm preserves the clean separation
between the heuristics and the actual search. We have implemented our algorithm
for OCaml. In our experimental evaluation, we found that the algorithm reduces
the running times for optimal type error localization from minutes to seconds
and scales better than previous localization algorithms.

suitable phenotypic variation to rapidly adapt in novel selective environments
which is crucial for evolvability. Recent work showed that when selective
environments vary in a systematic manner, it is possible that development can
constrain the phenotypic space in regions that are evolutionarily more
advantageous. Yet, the underlying mechanism that enables the spontaneous
emergence of such adaptive developmental constraints is poorly understood. How
can natural selection, given its myopic and conservative nature, favour
developmental organisations that facilitate adaptive evolution in future
previously unseen environments? Such capacity suggests a form of
\textit{foresight} facilitated by the ability of evolution to accumulate and
exploit information not only about the particular phenotypes selected in the
past, but regularities in the environment that are also relevant to future
environments. Here we argue that the ability of evolution to discover such
regularities is analogous to the ability of learning systems to generalise from
past experience. Conversely, the canalisation of evolved developmental
processes to past selective environments and failure of natural selection to
enhance evolvability in future selective environments is directly analogous to
the problem of over-fitting and failure to generalise in machine learning. We
show that this analogy arises from an underlying mechanistic equivalence by
showing that conditions corresponding to those that alleviate over-fitting in
machine learning enhance the evolution of generalised developmental
organisations under natural selection. This equivalence provides access to a
well-developed theoretical framework that enables us to characterise the
conditions where natural selection will find general rather than particular
solutions to environmental conditions.

evolution galaxies assume nearly integrable Hamiltonians with regular orbits;
our perturbation theories are founded on the averaging theorem for isolated
resonances. On the other hand, it is well-known that dynamical systems with
many degrees of freedom are irregular in all but special cases. The best
developed framework for studying the breakdown of regularity and the onset is
the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. Here, we use a numerical version of
the KAM procedure to construct regular orbits (tori) and locate irregular
orbits (broken tori). Irregular orbits are most often classified in
astronomical dynamics by their exponential divergence using Lyapunov exponents.
Although their computation is numerically challenging, the procedure is
straightforward and they are often used to estimate the measure of regularity.
The numerical KAM approach has several advantages: 1) it provides the
morphology of perturbed orbits; 2) its constructive nature allows the tori to
be used as basis for studying secular evolution; 3) for broken tori, clues to
the cause of the irregularity may be found by studying the largest, diverging
Fourier terms; and 4) it is more likely to detect weak chaos and orbits close
to bifurcation. Conversely, it is not a general technique and works most
cleanly for small perturbations. We develop a perturbation theory that includes
chaos by retaining an arbitrary number of interacting terms rather than
eliminating all but one using the averaging theorem. The companion papers show
that models with significant stochasticity seem to be the rule, not the
exception.

treatment effects from longitudinal observational data with time-dependent
confounders. Coarse SNMMs lead to a large class of estimators,within which an
optimal estimator can be derived under the conditions of well-specified models
for the treatment effect, for treatment initiation, and for nuisance regression
outcomes (Lok & Griner, 2015). The key assumption lies in a well-specified
model for the treatment effect; however, there is no existing guidance to
specify the treatment effect model, and model misspecification leads to biased
estimators, preventing valid inference. To test whether the treatment effect
model matches the data well, we derive a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test procedure
based on overidentification restrictions tests (Sargan, 1958; Hansen, 1982). We
show that our GOF statistic is doubly-robust in the sense that with a correct
treatment effect model, if either the treatment initiation model or the
nuisance regression outcome model is correctly specified, the GOF statistic has
a Chi-squared limiting distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number
of overidentification restrictions. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of
our methods using simulation designs based on an actual dataset. In addition,
we apply the GOF test procedure to study how the initiation time of highly
active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) after infection predicts the one-year
treatment effect in HIV-positive patients with acute and early infection.

electric fields. Strongly enhanced electric fields trigger electron field
emission and atom evaporation from the apexes of the nanotips. Combined
together, these processes may explain electric discharges in form of small
local arcs observed near metal surfaces in the presence of electric fields even
in ultra high vacuum conditions. In the present work we investigate the
stability of nanoscale tips by means of computer simulations of surface
diffusion processes on copper (Cu), the main material of high voltage
electronics. We study the stability and life-time of thin Cu surface nanotips
at different temperatures in terms of diffusion processes. For this purpose, we
have developed a surface Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model where the jump
processes are described by tabulated precalculated energy barriers. We show
that tall surface features with high aspect ratios can be fairly stable at room
temperature. However, the stability was found to depend strongly on the
temperature: 13 nm nanotips with the major axes in the <110> crystallographic
directions were found to flatten down to half of the original height in less
than 100 ns at temperatures close to the melting point, whereas no significant
change in the height of these nanotips was observed after 10 $\mu$s at room
temperature. Moreover, the nanotips built up along the <110> crystallographic
directions were found significantly more stable than those oriented in the
<100> or <111> crystallographic directions. The proposed KMC model has been
found well suited for simulating atomic surfaces processes and was validated
against Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation results via the comparison of the
flattening times obtained by both methods. We also note that the KMC
simulations were two orders of magnitude computationally faster than the
corresponding MD calculations.

The mean curl velocity are about $< 1$, 1-10, 10-150, 5-50 km/s in voids,
sheets, filaments and knots at $z=0$, respectively. The scaling of the vortical
velocity of gas can be well described by the She-Leveque hierarchical
turbulence model in the range of $l<0.65(1.50) h^{-1}$ Mpc in simulation of box
size 25(100) $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The fractal Hausdorff dimension of vortical motions,
$d$, revealed by velocity structure functions, is $\sim 2.1-2.3$($\sim

distribution in filaments, $\textit{D}^f \sim 1.9-2.2$, and smaller than the
fractal dimension of sheets, $\textit{D}^s \sim 2.4-2.7$. The vortical kinetic
energy of baryonic gas is mainly transported by filaments. Both the scaling of
mass distribution and vortical velocity increments show distinctive transition
at the turning scale of $\sim 0.65(1.50) h^{-1}$ Mpc, which may be closely

younger individuals have more contacts and, among them, males more than

the existence of relatively high-valued counts, rare observations discussed by
Rao (1995), and zero-block structure emphasized by Novak and Bar-Hen (2005) and
Greenacre (2013). In this paper, we aim to emphasize the important roles played
by L1 and L2 geometries. This will be done by comparing the maps obtained by CA
with the maps obtained by taxicab correspondence analysis (TCA), where TCA is a
robust L1 variant of correspondence analysis. If the projections of view of
both maps are quite different, we refer to this phenomenon as parallax. In
astronomy, parallax means the apparent change in the position of an object as
seen from two different points. In our case the two different points correspond
to the two different geometries, Euclidean and Taxicab. The existence of a
parallax highlights the important, but hidden, role of the underlying geometry
in the interpretation of the maps obtained in multivariate data analysis. We
emphasize the following fact: Only by comparing CA and TCA graphical displays,
we are able to reveal the phenomenon of parallax. Examples are provided.

importance in spatial statistics. In the literature, several non-parametric and
semi-parametric methods have been developed to estimate the covariance
structure based on the spectral representation of covariance functions.
However,they either ignore the high frequency properties of the spectral
density, which are essential to determine the performance of interpolation
procedures such as Kriging, or lack of theoretical justification. We propose a
new semi-parametric method to estimate spectral densities of isotropic spatial
processes with irregular observations. The spectral density function at low
frequencies is estimated using smoothing spline, while a parametric model is
used for the spectral density at high frequencies, and the parameters are
estimated by a method-of-moment approach based on empirical variograms at small
lags. We derive the asymptotic bounds for bias and variance of the proposed
estimator. The simulation study shows that our method outperforms the existing
non-parametric estimator by several performance criteria.

eigenvalue thresholding of the GMM trained on the projection of the measurement

degrades to the piecewise linear estimator (PLE) if each patch is represented

developed for CS inversion, constituting an additional contribution of this
paper. Extensive results on both simulation data and real data captured by the

Furthermore, we compare the CS reconstruction results using our algorithm with

negative values. The effects of the nonlocal nonlinear term and the
nonextensive parameter $q$ are examined on the modulational instability (MI) of
wave envelopes as well as on the solitary wave solution of the NLS equation. It
is found that the modulated wave packet is always unstable (nonlinear Landau
damping) due to the nonlocal nonlinearity in the NLS equation. Furthermore, the
effect of the nonlinear Landau damping is to slow down the amplitude of the
wave envelope, and the corresponding decay rate can be faster the larger is the

RW models statistically invariant under orthogonal transformations, we
analytically introduce a relation between $\langle\vec{R}_{N}^{2}\rangle$ and
the persistence length, $\lambda_{N}$, which is defined as the mean end-to-end
vector projection in the first step direction. For Self-Avoiding Walks (SAWs)
on 2D and 3D lattices we introduce a series expansion for $\lambda_{N}$, and by
Monte Carlo simulations we find that $\lambda_{\infty}$ is equal to a constant;
the scaling corrections for $\lambda_{N}$ can be second and higher order
corrections to scaling for $\langle\vec{R}_{N}^{2}\rangle$. Building SAWs with
typically one hundred steps, we estimate the exponents $\nu_{0}$ and
$\Delta_{1}$ from the IPL behavior as function of $j$. The obtained results are
in excellent agreement with those in the literature. This shows that only an
ensemble of paths with the same length is sufficient for determining the
scaling behavior of $\langle\vec{R}_{N}^{2}\rangle$, being that the whole
information needed is contained in the inner part of the paths.

probing a non-standard force in the sub-micrometre range. High sensitivity is
achieved by using a torsion balance that has a long torsional period, strong
magnetic damping of all vibrational motions and a feedback system that employs
an optical lever. In torsion balance experiments, the distance fluctuations
during measurements and the accuracy to which the absolute distance is
determined are crucial for determining the sensitivity of the balance to a
macroscopic force in the sub-micrometre range. We have estimated the root mean
square amplitude of the distance fluctuation to be 18 nm by considering the
effects due to seismic motions, tilt motions, residual angular fluctuations and
thermal fluctuations. We have also estimated the error of the absolute distance
to be 13 nm and the statistical error of the force to be 3.4$\times$10$^{-12}$
N by measuring the electrostatic forces. As a result of this systematic study,
we have evaluated the sensitivity of the balance to both a non-standard force
and to the Casimir force.

gravitational constant G might provide a partial solution to the dark matter
mystery. It has also been hypothesized that renormalization group scaling
transformations at large scales might supply the theoretical explanation. In
this letter, we demonstrate that multifractal coarse-graining scaling effects
due to classical fluctuations in the IR with consecutive symmetry breakings in
gravitational evolution and induced running of the gravitational constant with
fractal structures at larger scales may provide the plausible explanation of
the observed results of weak lensing observations and beyond. The sporadic and
localized antiscreening due to the running of the gravitational constant can
also provide the backbone for the cosmic evolution and large scale structure
formation. Our interpretation of this interesting finding is that such effects
are the result of the complexity phenomenon involving the evolution of
large-scale multifractal structures and accompanying fluctuations, not the
conventional arguments suggesting quantum gravity being the primary cause. We
also suggest that the running of the cosmological constant due to such
stochastic complexity evolution may provide a key to the understanding of the
observed cosmic acceleration.

alleged aurora sightings in the mid AD 770s in Europe: A ""red cross/crucifix""
in AD 773/4/6 from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, ""inflamed shields"" in AD 776
(both listed in the aurora catalogue of Link 1962), and ""riders on white

latter from the Royal Frankish Annals. We discuss the reports about these three
sightings in detail here. We can show that all three were halo displays: The
""red cross"" or ""crucifix"" is formed by the horizontal arc and a vertical pillar
of light (either with the Sun during sunset or with the moon after sunset); the
""inflamed shields"" and the ""riders on white horses"" were both two mock suns,
especially the latter narrated in form of a Christian adaptation of the antique
dioscuri motive. While the latter event took place early in AD 774 (dated AD
773 in Usoskin et al. 2013), the two other sightings have to be dated AD 776,
i.e. anyway too late for being in connection with a 14-C rise that started
before AD 775. We also sketch the ideological background of those sightings and
there were many similar reports throughout that time. In addition, we present a
small drawing of a lunar halo display with horizontal arc and vertical pillar

we can exploit both temporal and spatial parallelism by deepening and
duplicating pipelines, respectively. However, the performance is constrained by
several factors including available hardware resources on FPGA, an external
memory bandwidth, and utilization of pipeline stages, and therefore we need to
find the best mix of the different parallelism to achieve the highest
performance per power. In this paper, we present a domain-specific language
(DSL) based design space exploration for temporally and/or spatially parallel
stream computation with FPGA. We define a DSL where we can easily design a
hierarchical structure of parallel stream computation with abstract description

have been demonstrated by numerous researchers as an effective performance

turned to the use of overlay architectures as an intermediate generation target
built on top of off-the-shelf FPGAs. However, achieving the desired
performance-overhead trade-off remains a major productivity challenge as
complex application-specific customizations over a large design space covering
multiple architectural parameters are needed.
  In this work, an automatic nested loop acceleration framework utilizing a
regular soft coarse-grained reconfigurable array (SCGRA) overlay is presented.
Given high-level resource constraints, the framework automatically customizes
the overlay architectural design parameters, high-level compilation options as
well as communication between the accelerator and the host processor for
optimized performance specifically to the given application. In our
experiments, at a cost of 10 to 20 minutes additional tools run time, the
proposed customization process resulted in up to 5 times additional speedup
over a baseline accelerator generated by the same framework without
customization. Overall, when compared to the equivalent software running on the
host ARM processor alone on the Zedboard, the resulting accelerators achieved
up to 10 times speedup.

applications from a mobile device to a cloud processor via a wireless
interface. In light of the strong interplay between offloading decisions at the
application layer and physical-layer parameters, which determine the energy and
latency associated with the mobile-cloud communication, this paper investigates
the inter-layer optimization of fine-grained task offloading across both
layers. In prior art, this problem was formulated, under a serial
implementation of processing and communication, as a mixed integer program,
entailing a complexity that is exponential in the number of tasks. In this
work, instead, algorithmic solutions are proposed that leverage the structure
of the call graphs of typical applications by means of message passing on the
call graph, under both serial and parallel implementations of processing and
communication. For call trees, the proposed solutions have a linear complexity
in the number of tasks, and efficient extensions are presented for more general
call graphs that include ""map"" and ""reduce""-type tasks. Moreover, the proposed
schemes are optimal for the serial implementation, and provide principled
heuristics for the parallel implementation. Extensive numerical results yield
insights into the impact of inter-layer optimization and on the comparison of
the two implementations.

perform selection, yet their individual roles and how they influence each other
is still largely unclear. In particular, the ties between the external and
internal parts of the globus pallidus are paradoxical, as anatomical data
suggest a potent inhibitory projection between them while electrophys-iological
recordings indicate that they have similar activities. Here we introduce a
theoretical study that reconciles both views on the intra-pallidal projection,
by providing a plausible characterization of the relationship between the
external and internal globus pallidus. Specifically, we developed a mean-field
model of the whole basal ganglia, whose parameterization is optimized to
respect best a collection of numerous anatomical and electrophysiological data.
We first obtained models respecting all our constraints, hence anatomical and
electrophysiological data on the intrapallidal projection are globally
consistent. This model furthermore predicts that both aforementioned views
about the intra-pallidal projection may be reconciled when this projection is
weakly inhibitory, thus making it possible to support similar neural activity
in both nuclei and for the entire basal ganglia to select between actions.
Second, we predicts that afferent projections are substantially unbalanced
towards the external segment, as it receives the strongest excitation from STN
and the weakest inhibition from the striatum. Finally, our study strongly
suggest that the intrapallidal connection pattern is not focused but diffuse,
as this latter pattern is more efficient for the overall selection performed in
the basal ganglia.
