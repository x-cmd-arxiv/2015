of which variables to group first. For the important case in which the domain

the strength of the different possible relaxations defined by all three

topological insulators and topological semimetals, which have been extensively
studied recently and have been known to exist in various compounds.

towards the prediction and realization of realistic compounds. In this article,
a theoretical review on the Berry phase mechanism and related topological

problem in string mining, yet current algorithms are based on data structures
that are either space-inefficient or incur large slowdowns, and current

paper we engineer an algorithm based on the suffix tree of a string to use just
a small data structure built on the Burrows-Wheeler transform, and a stack of
$O(\sigma^2\log^2 n)$ bits, where $n$ is the length of the string and $\sigma$
is the size of the alphabet. The size of the stack is $o(n)$ except for very
large values of $\sigma$. We further improve the algorithm by removing its time
dependency on $\sigma$, by reporting only a subset of the maximal repeats and
of the minimal rare words of the string, and by detecting and scoring candidate
under-represented strings that $\textit{do not occur}$ in the string. Our
algorithms are practical and work directly on the BWT, thus they can be
immediately applied to a number of existing datasets that are available in this

regularized data-fit objective function, where the data-fit term is derived
from a physical image acquisition model. Typically the regularizer is selected
with two goals in mind: (a) to accurately reflect image structure, such as
smoothness or sparsity, and (b) to ensure that the resulting optimization
problem is convex and can be solved efficiently. The space of such regularizers
in Gaussian noise settings is well studied; however, non-Gaussian noise models
lead to data-fit expressions for which entirely different families of
regularizers may be effective. These regularizers have received less attention
in the literature because they yield non-convex optimization problems in
Gaussian noise settings. This paper describes such regularizers and a simple
reparameterization approach that allows image reconstruction to be accomplished
using efficient convex optimization tools. The proposed approach essentially
modifies the objective function to facilitate taking advantage of tools such as
proximal denoising routines. We present examples of imaging denoising under

they provide inference procedures that are more robust to parametric

We study the effects of bias correction on confidence interval coverage in the
context of kernel density and local polynomial regression estimation, and prove
that bias correction can be preferred to undersmoothing for minimizing coverage
error and increasing robustness to tuning parameter choice. This is achieved
using a novel, yet simple, Studentization, which leads to a new way of
constructing kernel-based bias-corrected confidence intervals. In addition, for
practical cases, we derive coverage error optimal bandwidths and discuss
easy-to-implement bandwidth selectors. For interior points, we show that the
MSE-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator (before bias correction)
delivers the fastest coverage error decay rate after bias correction when
second-order (equivalent) kernels are employed, but is otherwise suboptimal
because it is too ""large"". Finally, for odd-degree local polynomial regression,
we show that, as with point estimation, coverage error adapts to boundary
points automatically when appropriate Studentization is used; however, the
MSE-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator is suboptimal. All the
results are established using valid Edgeworth expansions and illustrated with
simulated data. Our findings have important consequences for empirical work as
they indicate that bias-corrected confidence intervals, coupled with
appropriate standard errors, have smaller coverage error and are less sensitive

small-world network properties of clustering and short paths have been
exploited computationally to produce biologically relevant information, they
have not been truly explored as such, i.e. as navigable small-world networks in
the original spirit of Milgram's work. This research seeks to fill this gap by
exploring local search on a network representation of proteins and to probe the
source of navigability in proteins. Previously, we confirmed that proteins are
navigable small-world networks and observed that local search paths exhibit
different characteristics from global search paths. In this paper, we
investigate the biological relevance of the differences in path characteristics
on a type III receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT). A chief difference that works in
favour of local search paths as intra-protein communication pathways is their
weaker proclivity, compared to global search paths, for traversing long-range
edges. Long-range edges tend to be less stable and their inclusion tends to
decrease the communication propensity of a path. The source of protein
navigability is traced to clustering provided by short-range edges. The
majority of a protein's short-range edges reside within structures deemed
important for long-range energy transport and modulation of allosteric
communication in proteins. Therefore, the disruption of intra-protein
communication as a result of the destruction of these structures via random
rewiring is expected. A local search perspective leads us to this expected
conclusion while a global search perspective does not. These findings initiate
the compilation of a list of path properties that are characteristic of
intra-protein pathways and could suggest fresh avenues for evolving and
regulating navigable (small-world) networks.

  We used the software called Platform for Reduction of Astronomical Images
Automatically (PRAIA) to minimise (digital coronography) the influence of the
scattered light of Uranus on the astrometric measurements and to determine
accurate positions of the main satellites. The positions of Uranus were then
indirectly determined by computing the mean differences between the observed
and ephemeris positions of these satellites. A series of numerical filters was
applied to filter out spurious data. These filters are mostly based on the
comparison between the positions of Oberon with those of the other satellites
and on the offsets as given by the differences between the observed and
ephemeris positions of all satellites.
  We have, for the overall offsets of the five satellites, -29 (+/-63) mas in
right ascension and -27 (+/-46) mas in declination. For the overall difference
between the offsets of Oberon and those of the other satellites, we have +3
(+/-30) mas in right ascension and -2 (+/-28) mas in declination. Ephemeris
positions for the satellites were determined from DE432+ura111. Comparisons
using other modern ephemerides for the solar system -INPOP13c- and for the
motion of the satellites -NOE-7-2013- were also made. They confirm that the

being popular in syndromic surveillance, signal and image processing, and
target detection based on sensor networks, among other applications. The use of
the scan statistics in such settings yields a hypothesis testing procedure,
where the null hypothesis corresponds to the absence of anomalous behavior. If
the null distribution is known, then calibration of a scan-based test is
relatively easy, as it can be done by Monte Carlo simulation. When the null
distribution is unknown, it is less straightforward. We investigate two
procedures. The first one is a calibration by permutation and the other is a
rank-based scan test, which is distribution-free and less sensitive to
outliers. Furthermore, the rank scan test requires only a one-time calibration
for a given data size making it computationally much more appealing. In both
cases, we quantify the performance loss with respect to an oracle scan test
that knows the null distribution. We show that using one of these calibration
procedures results in only a very small loss of power in the context of a
natural exponential family. This includes the classical normal location model,
popular in signal processing, and the Poisson model, popular in syndromic
surveillance. We perform numerical experiments on simulated data further
supporting our theory and also on a real dataset from genomics.

the ranking metric and rate is further computed by the SUs. Using this
performance measure, a PU evaluates its own utility function that it uses to

explain the success the local analysis enjoys in predicting global growth

  ultrafast demagnetization",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) and Py-Cu exhibit intriguing ultrafast
demagnetization behavior, where the Ni magnetic moment shows a delayed response
relative to the Fe [S. Mathias et al., PNAS {\bf 109}, 4792 (2012)]. To unravel
the mechanism responsible for this behavior, we have studied Py-Cu alloys for a
wide range of Cu concentrations using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD).
The magnetic moments of Fe and Ni are found to respond very differently to Cu
alloying: Fe becomes a strong ferromagnet in Py, with the magnetic moment
largely unaffected by Cu alloying. In contrast, the Ni magnetic moment
decreases continuously with increasing Cu concentration. Our results are
corroborated by ab-initio calculations of the electronic structure, which we
discuss in the framework of virtual bound states (VBSs). For high Cu
concentrations, Ni exhibits VBSs below the Fermi level, which are likely
responsible for an increased orbital/spin magnetic ratio at high Cu
concentrations. Fe exhibits VBSs in the minority band, approximately 1 eV above
the Fermi level in pure Py, that move closer to the Fermi level upon Cu
alloying. A strong interaction between the VBSs and excited electrons above the
Fermi level enhances the formation of localized magnons at Fe sites, which
explains the different behavior between Fe and Ni during ultrafast
demagnetization.

acts as an effective magnetic impurity that induces spin-flip scattering near
the Fermi energies of the trapped gas. Although the ultracold gas and SQUID are
at vastly different temperatures, the formation of a strongly correlated Kondo

temperature; this temperature regime is within current experimental limits.
Furthermore, the momentum distribution of the trapped fermions is calculated.
We find that it clearly contains an experimental signature of this correlated

explore the relaxation and equilibration of a strongly correlated system that

binaries under power law, broken power law, and free spectral coefficient GW
spectrum models. We place a 95\% upper limit on the strain amplitude (at a
frequency of yr$^{-1}$) in the power law model of $A_{\rm gw} < 1.5\times

odds ratios of 22 and 2.2 to one for the McWilliams and Sesana prior models,
respectively. The McWilliams model is essentially ruled out by the data, and
the Sesana model is in tension with the data under the assumption of a pure
power law. Using the broken power-law analysis we construct posterior
distributions on environmental factors that drive the binary to the GW-driven
regime including the stellar mass density for stellar-scattering, mass
accretion rate for circumbinary disk interaction, and orbital eccentricity for
eccentric binaries, marking the first time that the shape of the GWB spectrum
has been used to make astrophysical inferences. We then place the most
stringent limits so far on the energy density of relic GWs,
$\Omega_\mathrm{gw}(f)\,h^2 < 4.2 \times 10^{-10}$, yielding a limit on the

accelerate the spacecraft's own fuel, resulting in only a logarithmic gain in
maximum speed as propellant is added to the spacecraft. Light sails offer an
attractive alternative in which fuel is not carried by the spacecraft, with
acceleration being provided by an external source of light. By artificially
illuminating the spacecraft with beamed radiation, speeds are only limited by
the area of the sail, heat resistance of its material, and power use of the
accelerating apparatus. In this paper, we show that leakage from a light sail
propulsion apparatus in operation around a solar system analogue would be
detectable. To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave
beam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around
a single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz.
Leakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of Jy and
durations of tens of seconds at 100 pc. Because most travel within a planetary
system would be conducted between the habitable worlds within that system,
multiply-transiting exoplanetary systems offer the greatest chance of
detection, especially when the planets are in projected conjunction as viewed
from Earth. If interplanetary travel via beam-driven light sails is commonly
employed in our galaxy, this activity could be revealed by radio follow-up of
nearby transiting exoplanetary systems. The expected signal properties define a
new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

two receive different colors. The strong chromatic index $\chi'_s(G)$ of a
graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ has a strong $k$-edge-coloring.
Denote $\sigma(G)=\max_{xy\in

$\sigma(G) \le \chi'_s(G)$ for any graph $G$, and the equality holds when $G$

that $\chi'_s(G) \le 4 \Delta +4$ by using the Four Color Theorem. The upper
bound was then reduced to $4\Delta$, $3\Delta+5$, $3\Delta+1$, $3\Delta$,

precisely $\sigma(G)$. This result reflects the intuition that a planar graph

achieved purity of the state is slightly below the threshold for
entanglement-induced metrological gain, further technical improvement should
allow the generation of states that surpass this threshold, and of more complex
Schrodinger cat states for quantum metrology and information processing. More
generally, our results demonstrate the power of heralded methods for
entanglement generation, and illustrate how the information contained in a
single photon can drastically alter the quantum state of a large system.

combined with multi-wavelength photometry, provide extinction-corrected
H$\alpha$ star formation rates (SFR), gas phase metallicities from
[NII]/H$\alpha$, and stellar masses. We measure an integrated H$\alpha$ SFR of
$\sim325{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (26 members; R$_{\rm proj}<2$ Mpc) and show
that the elevated star formation in the cluster core (R$_{\rm proj}<0.25$ Mpc)

H$\alpha$-detected galaxy is half that of members at R$_{\rm proj}\sim1$ Mpc.
However, we do not detect any environmental imprint when comparing attenuation
and gas phase metallicities: the cluster galaxies show similar trends with
M$_{\star}$ as to the field, e.g. more massive galaxies have larger stellar
attenuation. IRC 0218's gas phase metallicity-M$_{\star}$ relation (MZR) is
offset to lower metallicities relative to $z\sim0$ and has a slope of
$0.13\pm0.10$. Comparing the MZR in IRC 0218 to the COSMOS cluster at $z=2.1$
shows no evolution ($\Delta t\sim1$ Gyr): the MZR for both galaxy clusters are
remarkably consistent with each other and virtually identical to several field

to circuits that are composed of THR gates as monotone majority circuits.
  The main result of this paper is an exponential lower bound on the size of
bounded-depth monotone majority circuits that compute $U_{k,N}$. More
precisely, we show that for any constant $d \geq 2$, any depth-$d$ monotone
majority circuit computing $U_{d,N}$ must have size
$\smash{2^{\Omega(N^{1/d})}}$. Since $U_{k,N}$ can be computed by a single
monotone weighted threshold gate (that uses exponentially large weights), our
lower bound implies that constant-depth monotone majority circuits require
exponential size to simulate monotone weighted threshold gates. This answers a
question posed by Goldmann and Karpinski (STOC'93) and recently restated by
Hastad (2010, 2014). We also show that our lower bound is essentially best
possible, by constructing a depth-$d$, size-$2^{O(N^{1/d})}$ monotone majority
circuit for $U_{d,N}$.
  As a corollary of our lower bound, we significantly strengthen a classical
theorem in circuit complexity due to Ajtai and Gurevich (JACM'87). They
exhibited a monotone function that is in AC$^0$ but requires super-polynomial
size for any constant-depth monotone circuit composed of unbounded fan-in AND

requires exponential size monotone circuits of any constant depth, even if the

perpendicular to the plane. The valley polarization near the edges of the

use of Kerr rotation microscopy. The polarization is out-of-plane, has opposite

Using classical-statistical methods, we showed that these systems share the
same self-similar scaling properties for a wide range of momenta in a limit
where particles are weakly coupled but their occupancy is high. Here we
significantly expand on our previous work and delineate two further
self-similar regimes. One of these occurs in the deep infrared (IR) regime of
very high occupancies, where the nonequilibrium dynamics leads to the formation
of a Bose-Einstein Condensate. The universal IR scaling exponents and the
spectral index characterizing the isotropic IR distributions are described by
an effective theory derived from a systematic large-$N$ expansion at
next-to-leading order. Remarkably, this effective theory can be cast as a
vertex-resummed kinetic theory. The other novel self-similar regime occurs
close to the hard physical scale of the theory, and sets in only at later
times. We argue that the important role of the infrared dynamics ensures that
key features of our results for scalar and gauge theories cannot be reproduced

states. It also shows that no such conservation exists for non-topological

an exponentially-small but non-zero overlap with the vacuum, leading to vacuum

The influence of the Mott physics on the doping-temperature phase diagram of

and experimental effort. Here, we investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics
in prototypical single-layer Bi-based cuprates at the energy scale of the
O-2p$\rightarrow$Cu-3d charge-transfer (CT) process. We demonstrate a clear
evolution of the CT excitations from incoherent and localized, as in a Mott
insulator, to coherent and delocalized, as in a conventional metal. This
reorganization of the high-energy degrees of freedom occurs at the critical
doping p$_{cr}\simeq$0.16 irrespective of the temperature, and it can be well
described by dynamical mean field theory calculations. We argue that the onset
of the low-temperature charge instabilities is the low-energy manifestation of
the underlying Mottness that characterizes the p<p$_{cr}$ region of the phase

functions of ${\cal N} = 2$ chiral primary operators in 4d ${\cal N} = 2$

fundamental hypermultiplets. The 2- and 3-point functions, viewed as functions
of the exactly marginal coupling constant and theta angle, obey the tt*
equations. In the case at hand, the tt* equations form a set of complicated
non-linear coupled matrix equations. We point out that there is an ad hoc
self-consistent ansatz that reduces this set of partial differential equations
to a sequence of decoupled semi-infinite Toda chains, similar to the one
encountered previously in the special case of SU(2) gauge group. This ansatz
requires a surprising new non-renormalization theorem in ${\cal N} = 2$
superconformal field theories. We derive a general 3-loop perturbative formula
for 2- and 3-point functions in the ${\cal N} = 2$ chiral ring of the SU(N)
theory, and in all explicitly computed examples we find agreement with the tt*
equations, as well as the above-mentioned ansatz. This is suggestive evidence
for an interesting non-perturbative conjecture about the structure of the
${\cal N} = 2$ chiral ring in this class of theories. We discuss several
implications of this conjecture. For example, it implies that the holonomy of
the vector bundles of chiral primaries over the superconformal manifold is
reducible. It also implies that a specific subset of extremal correlation
functions can be computed in the SU(N) theory using information solely from the
S^4 partition function of the theory obtained by supersymmetric localization.

simple economic model of targeted advertising. In our model, a consumer first
decides whether or not to buy a good, and then an advertiser chooses an
advertisement to show the consumer. The consumer's value for the good is
correlated with her type, which determines which ad the advertiser would prefer
to show to her---and hence, the advertiser would like to use information about
the consumer's purchase decision to target the ad that he shows.
  In our model, the advertiser is given only a differentially private signal
about the consumer's behavior---which can range from no signal at all to a
perfect signal, as we vary the differential privacy parameter. This allows us
to study equilibrium behavior as a function of the level of privacy provided to
the consumer. We show that this behavior can be highly counter-intuitive, and
that the effect of adding privacy in equilibrium can be completely different
from what we would expect if we ignored equilibrium incentives. Specifically,
we show that increasing the level of privacy can actually increase the amount
of information about the consumer's type contained in the signal the advertiser
receives, lead to decreased utility for the consumer, and increased profit for
the advertiser, and that generally these quantities can be non-monotonic and
even discontinuous in the privacy level of the signal.

with each other at different shared resources such as main memory and shared

previous work has proposed application-aware memory scheduling as a solution to
mitigate inter-application interference and improve system performance,
previously proposed memory scheduling techniques incur high hardware complexity
and unfairly slowdown some applications. Furthermore, previously proposed
memory-interference mitigation techniques are not designed to precisely control
application performance.
  This dissertation seeks to achieve high and controllable performance in
multicore systems by mitigating and quantifying the impact of shared resource
interference. First, towards mitigating memory interference and achieving high
performance, we propose the Blacklisting memory scheduler that achieves high
performance and fairness at low complexity. Next, towards quantifying the
impact of memory interference and achieving controllable performance in the
presence of memory bandwidth interference, we propose the Memory Interference
induced Slowdown Estimation (MISE) model. We propose and demonstrate two use
cases that can leverage MISE to provide soft performance guarantees and high
overall performance/fairness. Finally, we seek to quantify the impact of shared
cache interference on application slowdowns, in addition to memory bandwidth
interference. Towards this end, we propose the Application Slowdown Model
(ASM). We propose and demonstrate several use cases of ASM that leverage it to
provide soft performance guarantees and improve performance and fairness.

Universe, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpoint
locations of recent star formation. However, several GRB host galaxies have
recently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (H2), believed to be the
fuel of star formation. Moreover, optical spectroscopy of GRB afterglows
implies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gas
along the GRB line-of-sight. Here we report the first ever 21 cm line
observations of GRB host galaxies, using the Australia Telescope Compact Array,
implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (HI), which suggests that the
connection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previously
thought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas
(or with very efficient HI-to-H2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of molecular
gas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. This can happen in low
metallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas
(necessary for star formation) is faster than the HI-to-H2 conversion. Indeed,
large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellar
and dust masses are consistent with GRB hosts being preferentially galaxies
which have very recently started a star formation episode after accreting
metal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. This provides a natural route for
forming GRBs in low-metallicity environments. The gas inflow scenario is also
consistent with the existence of the companion HI object with no optical
counterpart ~19 kpc from the GRB 060505 host, and with the fact that the HI
centroids of the GRB 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with optical
centres of these galaxies, but are located close to the GRB positions.

work required to detect newly discovered malware families, and could
potentially learn generalizations about malware and benign software that
support the detection of entirely new, unknown malware families. Unfortunately,
few proposed machine learning based malware detection methods have achieved the
low false positive rates required to deliver deployable detectors.
  In this paper we a deep neural network malware classifier that achieves a
usable detection rate at an extremely low false positive rate and scales to
real world training example volumes on commodity hardware. Specifically, we
show that our system achieves a 95% detection rate at 0.1% false positive rate
(FPR), based on more than 400,000 software binaries sourced directly from our
customers and internal malware databases. We achieve these results by directly
learning on all binaries, without any filtering, unpacking, or manually
separating binary files into categories. Further, we confirm our false positive
rates directly on a live stream of files coming in from Invincea's deployed
endpoint solution, provide an estimate of how many new binary files we expected
to see a day on an enterprise network, and describe how that relates to the
false positive rate and translates into an intuitive threat score.
  Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to quickly train and deploy a
low resource, highly accurate machine learning classification model, with false
positive rates that approach traditional labor intensive signature based
methods, while also detecting previously unseen malware.

metallic nanorods, the longitudinal plasmon antenna mode (AM) of bonding
dipoles can compete with the transverse plasmonic cavity modes (CMs), yielding
dramatically enhanced or suppressed scattering efficiency, depending on the CMs
symmetry characteristics (e.g., the radial order n and the azimuthal quantum
number m ). More specifically, it is demonstrated that an appropriately loaded
gap layer enables substantial excitation of toroidal moment and its strong
interaction with the AM dipole moment, resulting in Fano- or
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-like profile in the scattering
spectrum. However, for CMs with nonzero azimuthal number, the spectrum features
a cumulative signature of the respective AM and CM resonances. We supply both
detailed near-field and far-field analysis for these phenomena, showing that
the modal overlap and phase relationship between the fundamental moments of
different order play a crucial role. A classical coupled oscillator model is
proposed which clearly reproduces the coexistence of scattering enhancement and
suppression. Finally, we show that the resonance bands of the AM and CMs can be
tuned by adjusting the geometry parameters and the permittivity of the load.
Our results may be useful in plasmonic cloaking, spin-polarized directional
light emission, ultra-sensitive optical sensing, and plasmon-mediated

that every state has a decomposition, with unique probabilities, into perfectly

Schur-concave functions, can be defined as the entropy of these probabilities.
We describe additional conditions under which the outcome probabilities of a
fine-grained measurement are majorized by those for a spectral measurement, and
therefore the ""spectral entropy"" is the measurement entropy (and therefore
concave). These conditions are (1) projectivity, which abstracts aspects of the
Lueders-von Neumann projection postulate in quantum theory, in particular that
every face of the state space is the positive part of the image of a certain
kind of projection operator called a filter; and (2) symmetry of transition
probabilities. The conjunction of these, as shown earlier by Araki, is
equivalent to a strong geometric property of the unnormalized state cone known
as perfection: that there is an inner product according to which every face of
the cone, including the cone itself, is self-dual. Using some assumptions about
the thermodynamic cost of certain processes that are partially motivated by our
postulates, especially projectivity, we extend von Neumann's argument that the
thermodynamic entropy of a quantum system is its spectral entropy to
generalized probabilistic systems satisfying spectrality.

(complex) Ginibre ensembles, and the second one is the product of truncations
of $m$ independent Haar unitary matrices with sizes $n_j\times n_j$ for $1\leq
j \leq m$. Assuming $m$ depends on $n$, by using the special structures of the
eigenvalues we developed, explicit limits of spectral distributions are
obtained regardless of the speed of $m$ compared to $n$. For the product of $m$
Ginibre ensembles, as $m$ is fixed, the limiting distribution is known by
various authors, e.g., G\""{o}tze and Tikhomirov (2010), Bordenave (2011),
O'Rourke and Soshnikov (2011) and O'Rourke {\it et al}. (2014). Our results
hold for any $m\geq 1$ which may depend on $n$. For the product of truncations
of Haar-invariant unitary matrices, we show a rich feature of the limiting
distribution as $n_j/n$'s vary. In addition, some general results on arbitrary
rotation-invariant determinantal point processes are also derived. Especially,
we obtain an inequality for the fourth moment of linear statistics of complex
random variables forming a determinantal point process. This inequality is
known for the complex Ginibre ensemble only [Hwang (1986)]. Our method is the
determinantal point process rather than the contour integral by Hwang.

input) has to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying data.
However, when representing sequential data from complex systems such as global
shipping traffic or web clickstream traffic as networks, conventional network
representations that implicitly assume the Markov property (first-order
dependency) can quickly become limiting. This assumption holds that when
movements are simulated on the network, the next movement depends only on the
current node, discounting the fact that the movement may depend on several
previous steps. However, we show that data derived from many complex systems
can show up to fifth-order dependencies. In these cases, the oversimplifying
assumption of the first-order network representation can lead to inaccurate
network analysis results. To address this problem, we propose the Higher-Order
Network (HON) representation that can discover and embed variable orders of
dependencies in a network representation. Through a comprehensive empirical
evaluation and analysis, we establish several desirable characteristics of HON,
including accuracy, scalability, and direct compatibility with the existing
suite of network analysis methods. We illustrate how HON can be applied to a
broad variety of tasks, such as random walking, clustering, and ranking, and we
demonstrate that by using it as input, HON yields more accurate results without
any modification to these tasks.

management of uncertain data. Recently, many database research efforts have
integrated probabilistic models into databases to support tasks such as
information extraction and labeling. Many of these efforts are based on batch
oriented inference which inhibits a realtime workflow. One important task is
entity resolution (ER). ER is the process of determining records (mentions) in
a database that correspond to the same real-world entity. Traditional pairwise
ER methods can lead to inconsistencies and low accuracy due to localized
decisions. Leading ER systems solve this problem by collectively resolving all
records using a probabilistic graphical model and Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) inference. However, for large datasets this is an extremely expensive
process. One key observation is that, such exhaustive ER process incurs a huge
up-front cost, which is wasteful in practice because most users are interested
in only a small subset of entities. In this paper, we advocate pay-as-you-go
entity resolution by developing a number of query-driven collective ER
techniques. We introduce two classes of SQL queries that involve ER operators
--- selection-driven ER and join-driven ER. We implement novel variations of
the MCMC Metropolis Hastings algorithm to generate biased samples and
selectivity-based scheduling algorithms to support the two classes of ER
queries. Finally, we show that query-driven ER algorithms can converge and
return results within minutes over a database populated with the extraction

a projected dictionary $PD$, where $P\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ is the
projection matrix and $D\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ is the dictionary. To
exactly recover the signal with a small number of measurements $m$, the
projected dictionary $PD$ is expected to be of low mutual coherence. Several
previous methods attempt to find the projection $P$ such that the mutual
coherence of $PD$ can be as low as possible. However, they do not minimize the
mutual coherence directly and thus their methods are far from optimal. Also the
solvers they used lack of the convergence guarantee and thus there has no
guarantee on the quality of their obtained solutions. This work aims to address
these issues. We propose to find an optimal projection by minimizing the mutual
coherence of $PD$ directly. This leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth minimization
problem. We then approximate it by smoothing and solve it by alternate
minimization. We further prove the convergence of our algorithm. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work which directly minimizes the mutual
coherence of the projected dictionary with a convergence guarantee. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can recover sparse signals

chains, new sites are always bonded to the most recently added sites and the
superblock Hamiltonian contains only new or once renormalized operators.
Junctions of up to $N = 3n + 1 \approx 500$ sites are studied with
antiferromagnetic (AF) Heisenberg exchange $J$ between nearest-neighbor spins
$S$ or electron transfer $t$ between nearest neighbors in half-filled Hubbard
models. Exchange or electron transfer is exclusively between sites in two
sublattices with $N_A \ne N_B$. The ground state (GS) and spin densities $
\rho_r = <S^z_r >$ at site $r$ are quite different for junctions with $S$ =
1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2. The GS has finite total spin $S_G = 2S (S)$ for even (odd)
$N$ and for $M_G =S_G$ in the $S_G$ spin manifold, $\rho_r > 0 (< 0)$ at sites
of the larger (smaller) sublattice. $S$ = 1/2 junctions have delocalized states
and decreasing spin densities with increasing $N$. $S$ = 1 junctions have four
localized $S_z = 1/2$ states at the end of each arm and centered on the
junction, consistent with localized states in $S$ = 1 chains with finite
Haldane gap. The GS of $S$ = 3/2 or 2 junctions of up to 500 spins is a spin
density wave (SDW) with increased amplitude at the ends of arms or near the
junction. Quantum fluctuations completely suppress AF order in $S$ = 1/2 or 1
junctions, as well as in half-filled Hubbard junctions, but reduce rather than
suppress AF order in $S$ = 3/2 or 2 junctions.

critical value $V_c(\theta)$. Upon increasing the interaction strength while
keeping $\theta$ fixed, the superfluid phase is destabilized in favor of a
checkerboard or a stripe solid depending on the tilt angle. We explore the
nature of the phase transition between the two solid phases and find evidence
of a micro-emulsion phase, following the Spivak-Kivelson scenario, separating
these two solid phases. Additionally, we study the stability of these quantum
phases against thermal fluctuations and find that the stripe solid is the most
robust, making it the best candidate for experimental observation.

lead to radioactively powered transients called kilonovae. The timescale and
peak luminosity of these transients depend on the composition of the ejecta,
which determines the local heating rate from nuclear decays and the opacity.
Kasen et al. (2013, ApJ, 774, 25) and Tanaka & Hotokezaka (2013, ApJ, 775, 113)
pointed out that lanthanides can drastically increase the opacity in these
outflows. We use the new general-purpose nuclear reaction network SkyNet to
carry out a parameter study of r-process nucleosynthesis for a range of initial
electron fractions $Y_e$, initial specific entropies $s$, and expansion
timescales $\tau$. We find that the ejecta is lanthanide-free for $Y_e \gtrsim
0.22 - 0.30$, depending on $s$ and $\tau$. The heating rate is insensitive to
$s$ and $\tau$, but certain, larger values of $Y_e$ lead to reduced heating
rates, due to individual nuclides dominating the heating. We calculate
approximate light curves with a simplified gray radiative transport scheme. The
light curves peak at about a day (week) in the lanthanide-free (-rich) cases.
The heating rate does not change much as the ejecta becomes lanthanide-free
with increasing $Y_e$, but the light curve peak becomes about an order of
magnitude brighter because it peaks much earlier when the heating rate is
larger. We also provide parametric fits for the heating rates between 0.1 and
$100\,\text{days}$, and we provide a simple fit in $Y_e$, $s$, and $\tau$ to
estimate whether the ejecta is lanthanide-rich or not.

finite number of users having identical deterministic demand sizes. The
congestion is of the processor sharing type in the sense that all users in the
system at any given time are served simultaneously. However, in contrast to
classical processor sharing congestion models, the processing slowdown is
proportional to the number of users in the system at any time. That is, the
rate of service experienced by all users is linearly decreasing with the number
of users. For each user there is an ideal departure time (due date). A
centralized scheduling goal is then to select arrival times so as to minimize
the total penalty due to deviations from ideal times weighted with sojourn
times. Each deviation is assumed quadratic, or more generally convex. But due
to the dynamics of the system, the scheduling objective function is non-convex.
Specifically, the system objective function is a non-smooth piecewise convex
function. Nevertheless, we are able to leverage the structure of the problem to
derive an algorithm that finds the global optimum in a (large but) finite
number of steps, each involving the solution of a constrained convex program.
Further, we put forward several heuristics. The first is the traversal of
neighbouring constrained convex programming problems, that is guaranteed to
reach a local minimum of the centralized problem. This is a form of a ""local
search"", where we use the problem structure in a novel manner. The second is a
one-coordinate ""global search"", used in coordinate pivot iteration. We then
merge these two heuristics into a unified ""local-global"" heuristic, and
numerically illustrate the effectiveness of this heuristic.

a step to meet this challenge, in this paper we investigate the joint
distribution of cherries and pitchforks (that is, subtrees with two and three
leaves) under two widely used null models: the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) model

novel recursive formulae, we propose a dynamic approach to numerically compute
the exact joint distribution (and hence the marginal distributions) for trees
of any size. We also obtained insights into the statistical properties of trees
generated under these two models, including a constant correlation between the
cherry and the pitchfork distributions under the YHK model, the log-concavity
and unimodality of cherry distributions under both models. In particular, we
show the existence of a unique change point for cherry distribution between the
two models, that is, there exists a critical value $\tau_n$ for each $n\geq 4$
such that the probability that a random tree with $n$ leaves generated under
the YHK model contains $k$ cherries is lower than that under the PDA model if
$1<k< \tau_n$, and higher if $\tau_n<k\le n/2$.

(WD) to secularly grow in mass, and derive limits on the accretion rate and on
the initial mass that will allow it to reach $1.4M_\odot$ --- the Chandrasekhar
mass. We follow the evolution through a long series of hydrogen flashes, during
which a thick helium shell accumulates. This determines the effective helium
mass accretion rate for long-term, self-consistent evolutionary runs with
helium flashes. We find that net mass accumulation always occurs despite helium
flashes. Although the amount of mass lost during the first few helium shell
flashes is a significant fraction of that accumulated prior to the flash, that
fraction decreases with repeated helium shell flashes. Eventually no mass is
ejected at all during subsequent flashes. This unexpected result occurs because
of continual heating of the WD interior by the helium shell flashes near its
surface. The effect of heating is to lower the electron degeneracy throughout
the WD, and especially in the outer layers. This key result yields helium
burning that is quasi-steady state, instead of explosive. We thus find a
remarkably large parameter space within which long-term, self-consistent
simulations show that a WD can grow in mass and reach the Chandrasekhar limit,

optimization framework based on manifold regularization, that involves
smoothness constraints of possible solutions with respect to the manifold. The

implemented in an adaptive manner. The initialization is conducted with only

motions each consisting of a line of particles displacing one and other. By
using molecular dynamics simulations of glassy polymers, we show that these
motions become highly repetitive back-and-forth motions as temperature
decreases and do not necessarily contribute to net displacements. Particle hops
which constitute string-like motions are reversed with a high probability,
reaching 73% and beyond at low temperature. Structural relaxation rate is then
dictated not by a simple particle hopping rate but instead by the rate at which
particles break away from hopping repetitions. We propose that disruption of
string repetitions and hence also structural relaxations are brought about by
pair-interactions between strings.

quantified the increase in the waiting time, recurrence time, and e-folding
rise timescale along the outburst sequence, and the corresponding decrease in
outburst duration, total radiated energy, and e-folding decay timescale, which
confirms previous findings. HLX-1 spends less and less time in outburst and
more and more time in quiescence, but its peak luminosity remains approximately
constant. We compared the HLX-1 outburst properties with those of bright
Galactic low-mass X-ray binary transients (LMXBTs). Our spectral analysis
strengthens the similarity between state transitions in HLX-1 and those in
Galactic LMXBTs. We also found that HLX-1 follows the nearly linear
correlations between the hard-to-soft state transition luminosity and the peak
luminosity, and between the rate of change of X-ray luminosity during the rise
phase and the peak luminosity, which indicates that the occurrence of the
hard-to-soft state transition of HLX-1 is similar to those of Galactic LMXBTs
during outbursts. We found that HLX-1 does not follow the correlations between
total radiated energy and peak luminosity, and between total radiated energy
and e-folding rise/decay timescales we had previously identified in Galactic
LMXBTs. HLX-1 would follow those correlations if the distance were several
hundreds of kiloparsecs. However, invoking a much closer distance for HLX-1 is
not a viable solution to this problem, as it introduces other, more serious
inconsistencies with the observations.

ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a
spectrum of large-scale, linearly-polarized, random-phase Alfv\'enic
fluctuations which have energy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic
fluctuations and vanishing correlation between the two fields. A turbulent
cascade rapidly develops, magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov-like
power-law spectrum at large scales and a steeper spectrum at ion scales. The
turbulent cascade leads to an overall anisotropic proton heating, protons are
heated in the perpendicular direction, and, initially, also in the parallel
direction. The imposed expansion leads to generation of a large parallel proton
temperature anisotropy which is at later stages partly reduced by turbulence.
The turbulent heating is not sufficient to overcome the expansion-driven
perpendicular cooling and the system eventually drives the oblique firehose
instability in a form of localized nonlinear wave packets which efficiently
reduce the parallel temperature anisotropy. This work demonstrates that kinetic
instabilities may coexist with strong plasma turbulence even in a constrained
2-D regime.

the effects of interplanetary plasma turbulence on SEPs as diffusion, using a
Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. However, FP models cannot explain the observed
fast access of SEPs across the average magnetic field to regions that are
widely separated in longitude within the heliosphere without using
unrealistically strong cross-field diffusion.
  Aims. We study whether the recently suggested early non-diffusive phase of
SEP propagation can explain the wide SEP events with realistic particle
transport parameters.
  Methods. We used a novel model that accounts for the SEP propagation along
field lines that meander as a result of plasma turbulence. Such a non-diffusive
propagation mode has been shown to dominate the SEP cross-field propagation
early in the SEP event history. We compare the new model to the traditional
approach, and to SEP observations.
  Results. Using the new model, we reproduce the observed longitudinal extent
of SEP peak fluxes that are characterised by a Gaussian profile with
$\sigma=30-50^\circ$, while current diffusion theory can only explain extents
of 11$^\circ$ with realistic diffusion coefficients. Our model also reproduces
the timing of SEP arrival at distant longitudes, which cannot be explained
using the diffusion model.
  Conclusions. The early onset of SEPs over a wide range of longitudes can be
understood as a result of the effects of magnetic field-line random walk in the
interplanetary medium and requires an SEP transport model that properly
describes the non-diffusive early phase of SEP cross-field propagation.

LSST Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) model (Jones et al. 2014). Two of the
metrics quantify the ability of LSST to detect non-periodic and/or
non-recurring transient events, and the ability of LSST to reliably measure
periodic signals of various timescales. The third metric provides a way to
quantify the range of stellar parameters in the stellar populations that LSST

implications based on these metrics for optimization of the LSST survey for
observations of stellar variables and transients.

$\sqrt{s}=319$ GeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $1.16$

reconstructed from their decays to charged pions, while leading neutrons
carrying a large fraction of the incoming proton momentum, $x_L>0.35$, are
detected in the Forward Neutron Calorimeter. The phase space of the measurement

observed in the NGC 4013 halo, we investigate their origin. By using GADGET -2

the overall NGC 4013 galaxy and its associated halo features. A gas-rich major
merger occurring 2.7-4.6 Gyr ago succeeds in reproducing the NGC 4013 galaxy
properties, including all the faint stellar features, strong gas warp,
boxy-shaped halo and vertical 3.6 mum luminosity distribution. High gas
fractions in the progenitors are sufficient to reproduce the observed thin and
thick discs, with a small bulge fraction, as observed. A major merger is able
to reproduce the overall NGC 4013 system, including the warp strength, the red
colour and the high stellar mass density of the loop, while a minor merger
model cannot. Because the gas-rich model suffices to create a pseudo-bulge with
a small fraction of the light, NGC 4013 is perhaps the archetype of a late-type
galaxy formed by a relatively recent merger. Then late type, pseudo-bulge
spirals are not mandatorily made through secular evolution, and the NGC 4013
properties also illustrate that strong warps in isolated galaxies may well
occur at a late phase of a gas-rich major merger.

computer scientists, and clinical practitioners. A major component of
personalized medicine is the estimation of individualized treatment rules
(ITRs). Recently, Zhao et al. (2012) proposed outcome weighted learning (OWL)
to construct ITRs that directly optimize the clinical outcome. Although OWL
opens the door to introducing machine learning techniques to optimal treatment
regimes, it still has some problems in performance. In this article, we propose
a general framework, called Residual Weighted Learning (RWL), to improve finite
sample performance. Unlike OWL which weights misclassification errors by
clinical outcomes, RWL weights these errors by residuals of the outcome from a
regression fit on clinical covariates excluding treatment assignment. We
utilize the smoothed ramp loss function in RWL, and provide a difference of
convex (d.c.) algorithm to solve the corresponding non-convex optimization
problem. By estimating residuals with linear models or generalized linear
models, RWL can effectively deal with different types of outcomes, such as
continuous, binary and count outcomes. We also propose variable selection
methods for linear and nonlinear rules, respectively, to further improve the
performance. We show that the resulting estimator of the treatment rule is
consistent. We further obtain a rate of convergence for the difference between
the expected outcome using the estimated ITR and that of the optimal treatment
rule. The performance of the proposed RWL methods is illustrated in simulation
studies and in an analysis of cystic fibrosis clinical trial data.

direct communication between proximate devices. While (ii) is treated
extensively in the recent literature, (i) has received relatively little
attention. In this paper we analyze a network-assisted underlay proximity
discovery protocol, where a cellular device can take the role of: announcer
(which announces its interest in establishing a D2D connection) or monitor
(which listens for the transmissions from the announcers). Traditionally, the
announcers transmit their messages over dedicated channel resources. In
contrast, inspired by recent advances on receivers with multiuser decoding
capabilities, we consider the case where the announcers underlay their messages
in the downlink transmissions that are directed towards the monitoring devices.
We propose a power control scheme applied to the downlink transmission, which
copes with the underlay transmission via additional power expenditure, while
guaranteeing both reliable downlink transmissions and underlay proximity

Here we demonstrate that chaotic behaviour is a rather generic feature in state
selective protocols: exponential sensitivity can exist for all initial states
in an experimentally realisable optical scheme. Moreover, any complex rational
polynomial map, including the example of the Mandelbrot set, can be directly
realised. In state selective protocols, one needs an ensemble of initial
states, the size of which decreases with each iteration. We prove that
exponential sensitivity to initial states in any quantum system have to be
related to downsizing the initial ensemble also exponentially. Our results show
that magnifying initial differences of quantum states (a Schr\""odinger

means of polarization-resolved photoluminescence and single-photon correlation
experiments. It is found that photons which are emitted in a double-step 4X-3X

polarization of correlated photons in the 2X-X cascade. In contrast, an
emission of either co-linear or cross-linear pairs of photons is observed for

shows doublet structure in the polarization-resolved photoluminescence

along and perpendicular to the [110] crystallographic direction. This effect is
ascribed to the fine structure splitting of the exciton and triexciton states
in the presence of an anisotropic confining potential of ae dot. We also show
that the splitting in the triexciton state surpasses that in the exciton state
by a factor up to eight and their ratio scales with the energy distance between

emit in soft X-rays and the UV, if accreted H-rich material burns stably. They
are an important component of the unresolved emission of elliptical galaxies,
and their combined ionizing luminosity may significantly influence the optical
line emission from warm ISM. In an earlier paper we modeled populations of
accreting WDs, first generating WD with main-sequence, Hertzsprung gap and red
giant companions with the population synthesis code \textsc{BSE}, and then
following their evolution with a grid of evolutionary tracks computed with
\textsc{MESA}. Now we use these results to estimate the soft X-ray
(0.3-0.7keV), H- and He II-ionizing luminosities of nuclear burning WDs and the
number of super-soft X-ray sources for galaxies with different star formation
histories. For the starburst case, these quantities peak at $\sim 1$ Gyr and
decline by $\sim 1-3$ orders of magnitude by the age of 10 Gyr. For stellar
ages of $\sim$~10 Gyr, predictions of our model are consistent with soft X-ray
luminosities observed by Chandra in nearby elliptical galaxies and He II
4686$\AA/\rm{H}{\beta}$ line ratio measured in stacked SDSS spectra of retired
galaxies, the latter characterising the strength and hardness of the UV
radiation field. However, the soft X-ray luminosity and
He~II~4686$\AA/\rm{H}{\beta}$ ratio are significantly overpredicted for stellar
ages of $\lesssim 4-8$ Gyr. We discuss various possibilities to resolve this
discrepancy and tentatively conclude that it may be resolved by a modification
of the typically used criteria of dynamically unstable mass loss for giant
stars.

theoretical calculations, in which the quality of theoretical models is clearly
demonstrated graphically. The main idea of the method consists in grouping
physical observables, represented by experiment and theoretical calculation,
into samples, each of which characterizes a certain physical process. A further
choice of a convenient criterion for comparing measurements and calculations,
its calculation and averaging within each sample and then over all samples,
makes it possible to choose the best theoretical model in the entire
measurement area. Published theoretical data of the three-fluid dynamic model
(3FD) applied to the experimental data from heavy-ion collisions at the energy
range $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\,=\,2.7 - 63$ GeV are used as example of application of
the developed methodology. When analyzing the results, the quantum nature of
the fireball, created at heavy ion collisions, was taken into account. Thus,
even at energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\,=\,63$ GeV of central collisions of heavy ions,
there is a nonzero probability of fireball formation without ignition of the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP). At the same time, QGP ignition at central collision
energies above at least $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\,=\,12 GeV occurs through two competing
processes, through a first-order phase transition and through a smooth
crossover. That is, in nature, these two possibilities are realized, which
occur with approximately the same probabilities.

choose between two alternatives and those who end up on the minority side win.
When the information available to the agents to make their choice is the
identity of the minority side for the past $m$ days, it is well-known that
emergent coordination among the agents is maximum when $m \sim \log_2(N)$. The
optimal memory-length thus increases with the system size. In this work, we
show that, in MG when the information available to the agents to make their

memory length for the agents is always two ($m=2$) for large enough system
sizes. The system is inefficient for $m=1$ and converge to random choice
behaviour for $m > 2$ for large $N$. Surprisingly, providing the agents with
uniformly and randomly sampled $m=1$ exogenous information results in an
increase in coordination between them compared to the case of endogenous
information with any value of $m$. This is in stark contrast to the
conventional MG, where agent's coordination is invariant or gets worse with
respect to such random exogenous information.

small. We show that measurements of the optical conductivity in BiSbTeSe$_2$

which is essential for understanding DC bulk transport. The puddles arise from
large fluctuations of the Coulomb potential of donors and acceptors, even in

around 40 K. Monte Carlo simulations show that a highly non-linear screening

Many applications, including quantum communication, sensing, and distributed
and cloud quantum computing, will require coherent photonic interconnection
between separate chip-based sub-systems. Large-scale quantum computing systems
and architectures may ultimately require quantum interconnects to enable
scaling beyond the limits of a single wafer and towards ""multi-chip"" systems.
However, coherently interconnecting separate chips is challenging due to the
fragility of these quantum states and the demanding challenges of transmitting
photons in at least two media within a single coherent system. Distribution and
manipulation of qubit entanglement between multiple devices is one of the most
stringent requirements of the interconnected system. Here, we report a quantum
photonic interconnect demonstrating high-fidelity entanglement distribution and
manipulation between two separate chips, implemented using state-of-the-art
silicon photonics. Path-entangled states are generated and manipulated on-chip,
and distributed between the chips by interconverting between path-encoding and
polarisation-encoding. We use integrated state analysers to confirm a Bell-type
violation of $S$=2.638+-0.039 between two chips. With improvements in loss,
this quantum interconnect will provide new levels of flexible systems and
architectures for quantum technologies.

related, by the vertex-IRF transformation, to the transfer matrix of the
dynamical 6-vertex model with antiperiodic boundary conditions, which we have
recently solved by means of Sklyanin's Separation of Variables (SOV) approach.
We show moreover that, in all the twisted cases, the vertex-IRF transformation
is bijective. This allows us to completely characterize, from our previous
results on the antiperiodic dynamical 6-vertex model, the twisted 8-vertex
transfer matrix spectrum (proving that it is simple) and eigenstates. We also
consider the periodic case for $\mathsf{N}$ odd. In this case we can define two
independent vertex-IRF transformations, both not bijective, and by using them
we show that the 8-vertex transfer matrix spectrum is doubly degenerate, and
that it can, as well as the corresponding eigenstates, also be completely
characterized in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of the dynamical
6-vertex antiperiodic transfer matrix. In all these cases we can adapt to the
8-vertex case the reformulations of the dynamical 6-vertex transfer matrix
spectrum and eigenstates that had been obtained by $T$-$Q$ functional

generalize the ones from a previous paper by the author, in which the

class is general enough to include (i) all $C^2$ sub-manifolds (ii) all
Lipschitz sub-manifolds with Lipschitz constant less than $\varepsilon$ (iii)
some sets with Hausdorff dimension larger than $k$. The Reifenberg condition,
roughly speaking, says that the set has a weak metric notion of a
$k$-dimensional tangent plane at every point and scale, but those tangents are
allowed to tilt as the scales vary. We show that if the Reifenberg parameter
$\varepsilon$ is small enough, the (arbitrary co-dimensional) level set flow
(in the sense of Ambrosio-Soner ) is non fattening, smooth and attains the
initial value in the Hausdorff sense. In particular, our result generalizes a
result of Wang and, in fact, all known existence and uniqueness results for
smooth mean curvature flow in arbitrary co-dimension. The largest deviation
from the proof of the co-dimension case comes in the proof of uniqueness (i.e.
non-fattening), where one is forced to work with the viscosity notion of the
high co-dimensional level set flow, rather than Ilmanen's more geometric
definition. This study leads to a general (short time) smooth uniqueness
result, generalizing the one for evolution of smooth sub-manifolds, which may

of a quantum state with respect to a given basis. We first use two of these,
the l_1-norm and relative entropy measures, to investigate tradeoffs between
the coherences of mutually unbiased bases. Results include relations between
coherence, uncertainty and purity; tight general bounds restricting the
coherences of mutually unbiased bases; and an exact complementarity relation
for qubit coherences. We further define the average coherence of a quantum
state. For the l_1-norm measure this is related to a natural 'coherence radius'
for the state, and leads to a conjecture for an l_2-norm measure of coherence.
For relative entropy the average coherence is determined by the difference
between the von Neumann entropy and the quantum subentropy of the state, and
leads to upper bounds for the latter quantity. Finally, we point out that the
relative entropy of coherence is a special case of G-asymmetry, which
immediately yields several operational interpretations in contexts as diverse
as frame-alignment, quantum communication and metrology, and suggests
generalising the property of quantum coherence to arbitrary groups of physical
transformations.

magnetic field where the plasma parameter is $\beta\sim 1-2$, density waves at
the magnetic resonances exert a positive torque on the planet and may slow down
or reverse its migration. However, when the magnetic field is weaker (i.e., the
plasma parameter $\beta$ is relatively large), then non-axisymmetric density
waves excited by the planet lead to growth of the radial component of the field
and, subsequently, to development of the magneto-rotational instability, such
that the disc becomes turbulent. Migration in a turbulent disc is stochastic,
and the migration direction may change as such. To understand migration in a

masses, quantum numbers and even the number of additional scalars. These models
based on CSI can be well tested at LHC Run II and at future lepton colliders.

this method, are related to the symplectic Cayley's transformation and belong
to a continuous space of dimension n(2n+1). Applying the implicit map to the

We show the relations of the elements of this family with other discrete
symplectic mapping, in particular 1) with the mappings obtained by generating
functions of type I, II, and III and IV; 2) with the symplectic Euler methods A

the shape of a semiflexible filament undergoes instabilities as the external

of higher bending modes. In particular, for strong fields the filament
stabilizes in a non-planar shape, resulting in a sideways drift or in helical
trajectories. For two interacting filaments, we find the same transitions, with
the important consequence that the new non-planar shapes have an effective
hydrodynamic repulsion, in contrast to the planar shapes which attract
themselves even when their osculating planes are rotated with respect to each

that the relative velocity is not necessarily due to a different drag of the
individual filaments, but to the hydrodynamic interactions induced by their

dimensionality of stupa that is hypothetically closely related to whole
architectural body. Fractal dimension is calculated by using the cube counting
method and found that the dimension is 2.325, which is laid between the
two-dimensional plane and three dimensional space. The applied fractal geometry
and self-similarity of the building is emerged as the building process
implement the metric rules, since there is no universal metric standard known
in ancient traditional Javanese culture thus the architecture is not based on
final master plan. The paper also proposes how the hypothetical algorithmic
architecture might be applied computationally in order to see some experimental
generations of similar building. The paper ends with some conjectures for
further challenge and insights related to fractal geometry in Javanese
traditional cultural heritages.

  maximum-weight, rooted-subtree problem","18 pages, 2 tables",,,,"cs.DS cs.CR math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In our cyber security model we define the concept of {\em penetration cost},
which is the cost that must be paid in order to break into the next layer of
security. Given a tree $T$ rooted at a vertex $r$, a {\em penetrating cost}
edge function $c$ on $T$, a {\em target-acquisition} vertex function $p$ on
$T$, the attacker's {\em budget} and the {\em game-over threshold} $B,G \in
{\mathbb{Q}}^{+}$ respectively, we consider the problem of determining the
existence of a rooted subtree $T'$ of $T$ within the attacker's budget (that
is, the sum of the costs of the edges in $T'$ is less than or equal to $B$)
with total acquisition value more than the game-over threshold (that is, the
sum of the target values of the nodes in $T'$ is greater than or equal to $G$).
We prove that the general version of this problem is intractable, but does
admit a polynomial time approximation scheme. We also analyze the complexity of
three restricted versions of the problems, where the penetration cost is the
constant function, integer-valued, and rational-valued among a given fixed
number of distinct values.

Quantum Physics. The later one though leads to a more complete interpretation,
based on two different patterns that appear when one works either with single
or double slits. Here we show that the two patterns can be derived from a
single principle, in the context of General Relativity, if one assumes an
additional spatial dimension to the four known today. The found equations yield
the same results as those in Quantum Mechanics.
