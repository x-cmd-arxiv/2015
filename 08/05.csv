\dot{\gamma}^{-1/3}$ which explains the $D_e\sim\dot{\gamma}^{-1/3}$ behavior.
The shear stress, $\sigma$, follows a similar rate dependence with
$\delta\sigma=\sigma-\sigma_y\sim \dot{\gamma}^{1/3}$ where $\sigma_y$ is the

quenching in heavy ion collisions that describes the production and
fragmentation of jets at weak coupling, using PYTHIA, and describes the rate at
which each parton in the jet shower loses energy as it propagates through the
strongly coupled plasma, dE/dx, using an expression computed holographically at
strong coupling. The model has a single free parameter that we fit to a single
experimental measurement. We then confront our model with experimental data on
many other jet observables, focusing here on boson-jet observables, finding
that it provides a good description of present jet data. Next, we provide the
predictions of our hybrid model for many measurements to come, including those
for inclusive jet, dijet, photon-jet and Z-jet observables in heavy ion
collisions with energy $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ ATeV coming soon at the LHC. As the
statistical uncertainties on near-future measurements of photon-jet observables
are expected to be much smaller than those in present data, with about an order
of magnitude more photon-jet events expected, predictions for these observables
are particularly important. We find that most of our pre- and post-dictions do
not depend sensitively on the form we choose for the rate of energy loss dE/dx
of the partons in the shower. This gives our predictions considerable
robustness. To better discriminate between possible forms for the rate of
energy loss, though, we must turn to intrajet observables. Here, we focus on
ratios of fragmentation functions. We close with a suggestion for a particular
ratio, between the fragmentation functions of inclusive and associated jets
with the same kinematics in the same collisions, which is particularly
sensitive to the x- and E-dependence of dE/dx, and hence may be used to learn
which mechanism of parton energy loss best describes the quenching of jets.

phase oscillators with inertia (rotators) whose natural frequencies are
unimodally or bimodally distributed. In the unimodal case, the system exhibits
a discontinuous hysteretic transition from an incoherent to a partially
synchronized (PS) state. For sufficiently large inertia, the system reveals the
coexistence of a PS state and of a standing wave (SW) solution. In the bimodal
case, the hysteretic synchronization transition involves several states.
Namely, the system becomes coherent passing through traveling waves (TWs), SWs
and finally arriving to a PS regime. The transition to the PS state from the SW
occurs always at the same coupling, independently of the system size, while its
value increases linearly with the inertia. On the other hand the critical
coupling required to observe TWs and SWs increases with N suggesting that in
the thermodynamic limit the transition from incoherence to PS will occur
without any intermediate states. Finally a linear stability analysis reveals
that the system is hysteretic not only at the level of macroscopic indicators,
but also microscopically as verified by measuring the maximal Lyapunov
exponent.

modality that seeks to reconstruct an estimate of the absorbed optical energy
density within an object. Conventional PACT image reconstruction methods assume
a constant speed-of-sound (SOS), which can result in image artifacts when
acoustic aberrations are significant. It has been demonstrated that
incorporating knowledge of an object's SOS distribution into a PACT image
reconstruction method can improve image quality. However, in many cases, the
SOS distribution cannot be accurately and/or conveniently estimated prior to
the PACT experiment. Because variations in the SOS distribution induce
aberrations in the measured photoacoustic wavefields, certain information
regarding an object's SOS distribution is encoded in the PACT measurement data.
Based on this observation, a joint reconstruction (JR) problem has been
proposed in which the SOS distribution is concurrently estimated along with the
sought-after absorbed optical energy density from the photoacoustic measurement
data. A broad understanding of the extent to which the JR problem can be
accurately and reliably solved has not been reported. In this work, a series of
numerical experiments is described that elucidate some important properties of
the JR problem that pertain to its practical feasibility. To accomplish this,
an optimization-based formulation of the JR problem is developed that yields a
non-linear iterative algorithm that alternatingly updates the two image
estimates. Heuristic analytic insights into the reconstruction problem are also
provided. These results confirm the ill-conditioned nature of the joint
reconstruction problem that will present significant challenges for practical
applications.

between the SCs and the leads,and, depending on the signs of the p-wave
pairings in the three SCs, there can also be one or three Majorana modes at the

peaks occurring at the energies of all these modes; we therefore get a rich
pattern of conductance peaks. Next, we use a renormalization group approach to
study the scattering matrix of the system at energies far from the SC gap. The
fixed points of the renormalization group flows and their stabilities are
studied; we find that the scattering matrix at the stable fixed point is highly
symmetric even when the microscopic scattering matrix and the interaction
strengths are not symmetric. We discuss the implications of this for the
conductances. Finally we propose an experimental realization of this system

$1/r^\alpha$, as well as a related class of fermionic Hamiltonians that
generalise the Kitaev chain, where both the hopping and pairing terms are
long-range and their relative strength can be varied. For these models, we
provide the phase diagram for all exponents $\alpha$, based on an analysis of
the entanglement entropy, the decay of correlation functions, and the edge
modes in the case of open chains. We demonstrate that violations of the area
law can occur for $\alpha \lesssim1$, while connected correlation functions can
decay with a hybrid exponential and power-law behaviour, with a power that is
$\alpha$-dependent. Interestingly, for the fermionic models we provide an exact
analytical derivation for the decay of the correlation functions at every
$\alpha$. Along the critical lines, for all models breaking of conformal
symmetry is argued at low enough $\alpha$. For the fermionic models we show
that the edge modes, massless for $\alpha \gtrsim 1$, can acquire a mass for
$\alpha < 1$. The mass of these modes can be tuned by varying the relative
strength of the kinetic and pairing terms in the Hamiltonian. Interestingly,
for the Ising chain a similar edge localization appears for the first and
second excited states on the paramagnetic side of the phase diagram, where edge
modes are not expected. We argue that, at least for the fermionic chains, these
massive states correspond to the appearance of new phases, notably approached
via quantum phase transitions without mass gap closure. Finally, we discuss the

description in terms of a probability distribution in phase space. As opposed
to the previous work, we generalise the test to include states without
rotational symmetry in phase space. Furthermore, we compare the performance of
the non-classicality test with classical tomography methods based on the
inverse Radon transform, which can also be used to establish the quantum nature
of a physical system. In particular, we consider a non-classicality test based
on the so-called filtered back-projection formula. We show that the general
non-classicality test is conceptually simpler, requires less assumptions on the

back-projection formula. As a specific example, we derive the optimal test for
a quadrature squeezed single photon state and show that the efficiency of the

function. In this paper, we provide a novel extension of the perceptron
algorithm to the learning to rank problem in information retrieval. We consider
popular listwise performance measures such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative
Gain (NDCG) and Average Precision (AP). A modern perspective on perceptron for
classification is that it is simply an instance of online gradient descent
(OGD), during mistake rounds, using the hinge loss function. Motivated by this
interpretation, we propose a novel family of listwise, large margin ranking
surrogates. Members of this family can be thought of as analogs of the hinge
loss. Exploiting a certain self-bounding property of the proposed family, we
provide a guarantee on the cumulative NDCG (or AP) induced loss incurred by our
perceptron-like algorithm. We show that, if there exists a perfect oracle
ranker which can correctly rank each instance in an online sequence of ranking
data, with some margin, the cumulative loss of perceptron algorithm on that
sequence is bounded by a constant, irrespective of the length of the sequence.
This result is reminiscent of Novikoff's convergence theorem for the
classification perceptron. Moreover, we prove a lower bound on the cumulative
loss achievable by any deterministic algorithm, under the assumption of
existence of perfect oracle ranker. The lower bound shows that our perceptron
bound is not tight, and we propose another, \emph{purely online}, algorithm
which achieves the lower bound. We provide empirical results on simulated and
large commercial datasets to corroborate our theoretical results.

of how often (finitely or infinitely many times, almost surely) a given spin

conditions in order to have models of type $\mathcal{F}$ (any spin flips
finitely many times), $\mathcal{I}$ (any spin flips infinitely many times) and
$\mathcal{M}$ (a mixed case). Several examples are provided in all dimensions

We do so both in the full theory, for which the vortex is an explicit classical
`fat brane' solution, and in the effective theory of `point branes' appropriate
when the vortices are much smaller than the scales of interest for their
back-reaction (such as the transverse Kaluza-Klein scale). We extend the
standard Nambu-Goto description to include the physics of flux-localization
wherein the ambient flux of the external Maxwell field becomes partially
localized to the vortex, generalizing the results of a companion paper to
include dilaton-dependence for the tension and localized flux. In the effective
theory, such flux-localization is described by the next-to-leading effective
interaction, and the boundary conditions to which it gives rise are known to
play an important role in how (and whether) the vortex causes supersymmetry to
break in the bulk. We track how both tension and localized flux determine the
curvature of the space-filling dimensions. Our calculations provide the tools
required for computing how scale-breaking vortex interactions can stabilize the
extra-dimensional size by lifting the dilaton's flat direction. For small
vortices we derive a simple relation between the near-vortex boundary
conditions of bulk fields as a function of the tension and localized flux in
the vortex action that provides the most efficient means for calculating how
physical vortices mutually interact without requiring a complete construction
of their internal structure. In passing we show why a common procedure for
doing so using a $\delta$-function can lead to incorrect results. Our
procedures generalize straightforwardly to general co-dimension objects.

$\rho\in (-1,0)\cup (0,\infty)$ and the argument $x$ is real. In the
probability theory applications, which are focused on studies of the
Poisson-Tweedie mixtures, the parameter $k$ is a non-negative integer. Several
representations involving well-known special functions are given for certain
particular values of $\rho$. The asymptotics of ${}_1\Psi_1(\rho,k;\rho,0;x)$

protocol in the presence of {\em unchangeable environment actions}. Such
unchangeable actions occur in practice due to several reasons. One instance
includes the case where only a subset of the components/processes can be
revised and other components/processes must be as is. Another instance includes
cyber-physical systems where revising physical components may be undesirable or
impossible. These actions differ from faults in that they are simultaneously
{\em assistive} and {\em disruptive}, whereas faults are only disruptive. For
example, if these actions are a part of a physical component, their execution
is essential for the normal operation of the system. However, they can
potentially disrupt actions taken by other components for dealing with faults.
Also, one can typically assume that fault actions will stop for a long enough
time for the program to make progress. Such an assumption is impossible in this
context.
  We present algorithms for adding stabilizing fault-tolerance, failsafe
fault-tolerance and masking fault-tolerance. Interestingly, we observe that the
previous approaches for adding stabilizing fault-tolerance and masking
fault-tolerance cannot be easily extended in this context. However, we find
that the overall complexity of adding these levels of fault-tolerance remains
in P (in the state space of the program). We also demonstrate that our
algorithms are sound and complete.

infinity, by mean of expanding the potential as a power series in m3^1/3, (the
mass of the third small primary) and taking the limit case when m3 tends to
zero. The limiting Hamiltonian depends on a parameter mu (the mass of the
second primary) and possesses some dynamical features from both the classical
restricted three- body problem and the restricted four-body problem. We explore
the families of periodic orbits of the infinitesimal particle for some values
of the mass pa- rameter, these explorations show interesting properties
regarding the periodic orbits for this problem, in particular for the

discrete representation of the geometry. This representation is typically
continuous but {\em not} differentiable. The need to define physical quantities
on this geometric representation has led to development of sets of basis
functions that need to satisfy constraints at the boundaries of the
elements/tesselations (viz., continuity of normal or tangential components
across element boundaries). For electromagnetics, these result in either
curl/div-conforming basis sets. The geometric representation used for analysis
is in stark contrast with that used for design, wherein the surface
representation is higher order differentiable. Using this representation for
{\em both} geometry and physics on geometry has several advantages, and is
eludicated in Hughes et al., Isogeometric analysis: CAD, finite elements,
NURBS, exact geometry and mesh refinement, Computer Methods in Applied
Mechanics and Engineering 194 (39-41) (2005). Until now, a bulk of the
literature on isogeometric methods have been limited to solid mechanics, with
some effort to create NURBS based basis functions for electromagnetic analysis.
In this paper, we present the first complete isogeometry solution methodology
for the electric field integral equation as applied to simply connected
structures. This paper systematically proceeds through surface representation
using subdivision, definition of vector basis functions on this surface, to
fidelity in the solution of integral equations. We also present techniques to
stabilize the solution at low frequencies, and impose a Calder\'{o}n
preconditioner. Several results presented serve to validate the proposed
approach as well as demonstrate some of its capabilities.

accrete through a geometrically thick, optically thin, rotationally supported
plasma that we will refer to as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF). RIAFs are typically collisionless in the sense that the Coulomb mean
free path is large compared to $GM/c^2$, and relativistically hot near the
event horizon. In this paper we develop a phenomenological model for the plasma
in RIAFs, motivated by the application to sources such as Sgr A* and M87. The
model is derived using Israel-Stewart theory, which considers deviations up to
second order from thermal equilibrium, but modified for a magnetized plasma.
This leads to thermal conduction along magnetic field lines and a difference in
pressure, parallel and perpendicular to the field lines (which is equivalent to
anisotrotropic viscosity). In the non-relativistic limit, our model reduces to
the widely used Braginskii theory of magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas. We
compare our model to the existing literature on dissipative relativistic
fluids, describe the linear theory of the plasma, and elucidate the physical
meaning of the free parameters in the model. We also describe limits of the
model when the conduction is saturated and when the viscosity implies a large
pressure anisotropy. In future work, the formalism developed in this paper will
be used in numerical models of RIAFs to assess the importance of non-ideal
processes for the dynamics and radiative properties of slowly accreting black
holes.

We lose the solution to the hierarchy problem. However, such a scenario has
several motivations. For example, the lightest neutral superworld particle will
be a candidate for dark matter. The other being, as in supersymmetry, it is
possible to achieve gauge coupling unification. One major difference with the
supersymmetric theory is that such a theory is much more general since it is
not constrained by supersymmetry. For example, some of the gauge couplings
connecting the Standard Model particles with the superpartners now become free
Yukawa couplings. As a result, the final state signals as well as the limits on
the superworld particles can be modified both qualitatively and quantitatively.
The reach for these superworld particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can

  In a forecast for the complete, 5-year DES survey we show that internally
estimated covariance matrices can provide a large fraction of the true
uncertainties on cosmological parameters in a 2D cosmic shear analysis. The
volume inside contours of constant likelihood in the $\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$
plane as measured with internally estimated covariance matrices is on average
$\gtrsim 85\%$ of the volume derived from the true covariance matrix. The
uncertainty on the parameter combination $\Sigma_8 \sim \sigma_8
\Omega_m^{0.5}$ derived from internally estimated covariances is $\sim 90\%$ of
the true uncertainty.

that ${\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$ has contributions from two sources. One is the usual
variance for a Gaussian random field which scales inversely of the number of

trispectrum of the signal. Using the simulated 21-cm signal ensemble, an
ensemble of the randomized signal and ensembles of Gaussian random ensembles we
have quantified the effect of the trispectrum on the error variance
${\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$. We find that its relative contribution is comparable to
or larger than that of the Gaussian term for the $k$ range $0.3 \leq k \leq 1.0
\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and can be even $\sim 200$ times larger at $k \sim 5\, {\rm
Mpc}^{-1}$. We also establish that the off-diagonal terms of
${\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$ have statistically significant non-zero values which arise
purely from the trispectrum. This further signifies that the error in different
$k$ modes are not independent. We find a strong correlation between the errors
at large $k$ values ($\ge 0.5 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), and a weak correlation
between the smallest and largest $k$ values. There is also a small
anti-correlation between the errors in the smallest and intermediate $k$

astrophysical phenomena, however they require the use of simplified radiation
transport and thermal prescriptions to reduce computational cost. In this paper
we present a systematic study of the importance of microphysical processes in
RHD simulations using the example of D-type HII region expansion. We compare
the simplest hydrogen-only models with those that include: ionisation of H, He,
C, N, O, S and Ne, different gas metallicity, non-LTE metal line blanketed
stellar spectral models of varying metallicity, radiation pressure, dust and
treatment of photodissociation regions. Each of these processes are explicitly
treated using modern numerical methods rather than parameterisation. In line
with expectations, changes due to microphysics in either the effective number
of ionising photons or the thermal structure of the gas lead to differences in
D-type expansion. In general we find that more realistic calculations lead to
the onset of D-type expansion at smaller radii and a slower subsequent
expansion. Simulations of star forming regions using simplified microphysics
are therefore likely overestimating the strength of radiative feedback. We find
that both variations in gas metallicity and the inclusion of dust can affect
the ionisation front evolution at the 10-20 per cent level over 500kyr, which
could substantially modify the results of simplified 3D models including
feedback. Stellar metallicity, radiation pressure and the inclusion of
photodissociation regions are all less significant effects at the 1 per cent
level or less, rendering them of minor importance in the modelling the
dynamical evolution of HII regions.

eclipse depths to the predictions of a suite of atmosphere models and to
eclipse depths for planets with previously published observations in order to
constrain the temperature- and mass-dependent properties of gas giant planet
atmospheres. We find that the dayside emission spectra of planets less massive
than Jupiter require models with efficient circulation of energy to the night
side and/or increased albedos, while those with masses greater than that of
Jupiter are consistently best-matched by models with inefficient circulation
and low albedos. At these relatively low temperatures we expect the atmospheric
methane to CO ratio to vary as a function of metallicity, and we therefore use
our observations of these planets to constrain their atmospheric metallicities.
We find that the most massive planets have dayside emission spectra that are
best-matched by solar metallicity atmosphere models, but we are not able to
place strong constraints on metallicities of the smaller planets in our sample.
Interestingly, we find that the ratio of the 3.6 and 4.5 micron brightness
temperatures for these cool transiting planets is independent of planet
temperature, and instead exhibits a tentative correlation with planet mass. If
this trend can be confirmed, it would suggest that the shape of these planets'

Planet-induced vortices are a product of the Rossby wave instability (RWI)
triggered in the edges of a planetary gap. In this work we assess the influence
of radial buoyancy for the development of the vortices. We found that radial
buoyancy leads to smoother planetary gaps, which generates weaker vortices.
This effect is less pronounced for locally isothermal and quasi-isothermal
(very small cooling rate) disks. We observed the formation of two generations
of vortices. The first generation of vortices is formed in the outer wall of
the planetary gap. The merged primary vortex induces accretion, depleting the
mass on its orbit. This process creates a surface density enhancement beyond
the primary vortex position. The second generation of vortices arise in this
surface density enhancement, indicating that the bump in this region is
sufficient to trigger the RWI. The merged secondary vortex is a promising
explanation for the location of the vortex in the Oph IRS48 system. Finally, we
observed a nonmonotonic behavior for the vortex lifetimes as a function of the
thermal relaxation timescale, agreeing with previous studies. The birth times
of the secondary vortices also display a nonmonotonic behavior, which is
correlated with the growth time of the primary vortex and its induced
accretion.

au in protoplanetary discs, using a series of local non-ideal

Solar Nebula (MMSN) disc that is threaded by a net vertical magnetic field of
specified strength. Confirming previous results, we find that the Hall effect
has only a modest impact on accretion at 30 au, and essentially none at 100 au.
At 1-10 au the Hall effect introduces a pronounced bi-modality in the accretion
process, with vertical magnetic fields aligned to the disc rotation supporting
a strong laminar Maxwell stress that is absent if the field is anti-aligned. In
the anti-aligned case, we instead find evidence for bursts of turbulent stress
at 5-10 au, which we tentatively identify with the non-axisymmetric Hall-shear
instability. The presence or absence of these bursts depends upon the details
of the adopted chemical model, which suggests that appreciable regions of
actual protoplanetary discs might lie close to the borderline between laminar
and turbulent behaviour. Given the number of important control parameters that
have already been identified in MHD models, quantitative predictions for disc
structure in terms of only radius and accretion rate appear to be difficult.
Instead, we identify robust qualitative tests of magnetically driven accretion.
These include the presence of turbulence in the outer disc, independent of the
orientation of the vertical magnetic fields, and a Hall-mediated bi-modality in
turbulent properties extending from the region of thermal ionization to 10 au.

observed non-linearity of the period-luminosity relation observed for
short-period Cepheids in the SMC. We compare spatial distributions of ACs,

in Hele-Shaw cells. The dynamics of the interface is studied as one fluid
displaces the other in a clean lattice and in a lattice with quenched disorder.
For the clean system, if the fluid with a lower viscosity displaces the other,
we show that the model exhibits the Saffman-Taylor instability phenomenon,
whose features are in very good agreement with those observed in real (viscous)
fluids. In the system with quenched disorder, we obtain estimates for the
growth and roughening exponents of the interface width in two cases:
viscosity-matched fluids and the case of unstable interface. The first case is
shown to be in the same universality class of the random deposition model with
surface relaxation. Moreover, while the early-time dynamics of the interface
behaves similarly, viscous fingers develop in the second case with the
subsequent production of bubbles in the context of a complex dynamics. We also
identify the Hurst exponent of the subdiffusive fractional Brownian motion
associated with the interface, from which we derive its fractal dimension and
the universality classes related to a percolation process.

gravitational interactions and collisions between smaller bodies. We use
numerical simulations to show that practically identical initial conditions
result in a wide array of final planetary configurations. This is a result of
the chaotic evolution of trajectories which are highly sensitive to minuscule
displacements. We determine that differences between systems evolved from
virtually identical initial conditions can be larger than the differences
between systems evolved from very different initial conditions. This implies
that individual simulations lack predictive power. For example, there is not a
reproducible mapping between the initial and final surface density profiles.
However, some key global properties can still be extracted if the statistical
spread across many simulations is considered. Based on these spreads, we
explore the collisional growth and orbital properties of terrestrial planets
which assemble from different initial conditions (we vary the initial
planetesimal distribution, planetesimal masses, and giant planet orbits).
Confirming past work, we find that the resulting planetary systems are sculpted
by sweeping secular resonances. Configurations with giant planets on eccentric
orbits produce fewer and more massive terrestrial planets on tighter orbits
than those with giants on circular orbits. This is further enhanced if the
initial mass distribution is biased to the inner regions. In all cases, the
outer edge of the system is set by the final location of the $\nu_6$ resonance
and we find that the mass distribution peaks at the $\nu_5$ resonance. Using
existing observations, we find that extrasolar systems follow similar trends.
Although differences between our numerical modelling and exoplanetary systems

techniques to directly measure the residual trapped ions. Our two primary
indicators of successful clearing are the amount of ion current removed by a DC
clearing electrode, and the absence of bremsstrahlung radiation generated by
beam-ion interactions. Measurements were taken for an electron beam with an
energy of 5 MeV and CW beam currents in the range of 1-20 mA. Several
theoretical models have been developed to explain our data. Using them, we are
able to estimate the clearing electrode voltage required for maximum ion
clearing, the creation and clearing rates of the ions while employing bunch

shaking. In all cases, we achieve a maximum ion clearing of at least 70 percent

this is most likely due to strong selection effects towards short-period
planets. The eccentricities of the planets in our Solar System are relatively
small compared to those in observed exosolar systems, but still consistent with
the expectations for an 8-planet system (and could, in addition, reflect a
selection bias towards high-eccentricity planets). The two characteristics of
the Solar System that we find to be most special are the lack of super-Earths
with orbital periods of days to months and the general lack of planets inside
of the orbital radius of Mercury. Overall, we conclude that in terms of its

in finding their common effect. It would typically reject the null hypothesis
of no effect if any one of the studies shows strong significance. The partial
conjunction null hypothesis is rejected only when at least $r$ of $n$ component
hypotheses are non-null with $r = 1$ corresponding to a usual meta-analysis.
Compared with meta-analysis, it can encourage replicable findings across
studies. A by-product of it when applied to different $r$ values is a
confidence interval of $r$ quantifying the proportion of non-null studies.
Benjamini and Heller (2008) provided a valid test for the partial conjunction
null by ignoring the $r - 1$ smallest p-values and applying a valid
meta-analysis p-value to the remaining $n - r + 1$ p-values. We provide
sufficient and necessary conditions of admissible combined p-value for the
partial conjunction hypothesis among monotone tests. Non-monotone tests always
dominate monotone tests but are usually too unreasonable to be used in
practice. Based on these findings, we propose a generalized form of Benjamini
and Heller's test which allows usage of various types of meta-analysis
p-values, and apply our method to an example in assessing replicable benefit of
new anticoagulants across subgroups of patients for stroke prevention.

compensatory expectation-maximization techniques. Equally, the use of
alternative statistical approaches, such as multivariate logistic regression,

co-linearity. This article takes an information-theoretic approach in
developing a new statistical formula for the calculation of likelihood ratios
based on the principles of quantum entanglement. In doing so, it is argued that
this quantum approach demonstrates: that the likelihood ratio is a real quality

reducing the spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are

renewable energy via microbial fuel cells which can reverse the process of
electrosynthesis.Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms
used by bacteria.Thus,it is of fundamental importance to understand
interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help
control them,in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial
capabilities.This position paper explores how abstractions from
communications,networking and information theory can play a role in
understanding and modeling bacterial interactions.In particular,two forms of
interactions in bacterial systems will be examined:electron transfer and quorum
sensing.While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily
studied,electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell
interaction is less understood.Recent experimental observations open up new
frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer,which
may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular
diffusion.In quorum sensing,the concentration of certain signature chemical
compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population
size,so as to activate collective behaviors.In this position paper,queuing
models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models
for quorum sensing.These models are stochastic,and thus capture the inherent
randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature.It is shown that queuing models
allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of
interactions with other cells and the environment,while being amenable to
complexity reduction.

the ability of MCMCs to sample from modern-day high-dimensional posteriors,

typically experience serious convergence problems. In this paper, we first
demonstrate that contemporary methods for obtaining convergence rates have
serious limitations when the dimension grows. We then propose a framework for
rigorously establishing the convergence behavior of commonly used

nature and severity of the convergence problems of popular MCMCs when
implemented in high dimensions, including phase transitions in the convergence
rates in various $n$ and $p$ regimes, and a universality result across an
entire spectrum of models. We also show that convergence problems effectively
eliminate the apparent safeguard of geometric ergodicity. We then demonstrate
theoretical principles by which MCMCs can be constructed and analyzed to yield
bounded geometric convergence rates even as the dimension $p$ grows without

fixed baryonic mass, consistent with a scenario in which blue early types can
regrow late-type disks. In fact, we find that the only significant difference
in the typical group halo mass inhabited by different galaxy classes is for
satellite galaxies with different colors, where at fixed baryonic mass red
early and late types have higher typical group halo masses than blue early and

function is 2.3$\times10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$, and its orbital plane is

breakup velocity. We detected strong variations of the Balmer and He I
emission-line profiles on timescales from days to years. This points to a
variable stellar wind of the primary in addition to the presence of a
circum-primary gaseous disk. The strength of the absorption-line spectrum along
with the optical and near-IR continuum suggest that the primary contributes
$\sim$60% of the $V$--band flux, the disk contributes $\sim$30%, and the

  The intranight variability amplitude is generally greater at higher

  We found spectral variations in BL Lacertae in the sense that the optical
spectrum becomes flatter as the flux increases but in several flaring states
deviates from the linear trend suggesting different jet components contributing
to the emission at different times.

result from the effects of the large overshooting of convective core. The
distributions of $r_{01}$ and $r_{10}$ of different stars with a convective
core can be reproduced by the function $B(\nu_{n,1})$. If the value of the
critical frequency $\nu_{0}$ is larger than the value of frequency of maximum
oscillation power $\nu_{max}$, a star may have a small convective core and
$\delta_{\rm ov}$. But if the value of $\nu_{0}$ is less than that of
$\nu_{max}$, the star may have a large convective core and

region from observed frequencies. The determination is not dependent on the

respect to optical ones of ~250 days. The optical and radio light curves do not
show any significant timescales of variability. BL Lacertae showed many optical
'mini-flares' on short time-scales. Variations on longer term timescales are
mildly chromatic with superposition of many strong optical outbursts. In radio
bands, the amplitude of variability is frequency dependent. Flux variations at
higher radio frequencies lead the lower frequencies by days or weeks.
  The optical variations are consistent with being dominated by a geometric
scenario where a region of emitting plasma moves along a helical path in a
relativistic jet. The frequency dependence of the variability amplitude
supports an origin of the observed variations intrinsic to the source.

reconstruct a sparse signal accurately from compressed and noisy measurements.
This paper proposes a novel support detection method for greedy algorithms,
which is referred to as ""\textit{maximum a posteriori (MAP) support
detection}"". Unlike existing support detection methods that identify support
indices with the largest correlation value in magnitude per iteration, the
proposed method selects them with the largest likelihood ratios computed under
the true and null support hypotheses by simultaneously exploiting the
distributions of sensing matrix, sparse signal, and noise. Leveraging this
technique, MAP-Matching Pursuit (MAP-MP) is first presented to show the
advantages of exploiting the proposed support detection method, and a
sufficient condition for perfect signal recovery is derived for the case when
the sparse signal is binary. Subsequently, a set of iterative greedy
algorithms, called MAP-generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (MAP-gOMP),
MAP-Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (MAP-CoSaMP), and MAP-Subspace
Pursuit (MAP-SP) are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
support detection method to existing greedy algorithms. From empirical results,
it is shown that the proposed greedy algorithms with highly reliable support
detection can be better, faster, and easier to implement than basis pursuit via
linear programming.

time variability in the angular positions, peak amplitudes and shapes of radio
sources, potentially complicating the automated cross-matching and
identification of transient and variable radio sources. In this work, we
empirically assess the effects of the ionosphere on data taken by the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope. We directly examine 51 hours of data
observed over 10 nights under quiet geomagnetic conditions (global storm index
Kp < 2), analysing the behaviour of short-timescale angular position and peak
flux density variations of around ten thousand unresolved sources. We find that
while much of the variation in angular position can be attributed to
ionospheric refraction, the characteristic displacements (10-20 arcsec) at 154
MHz are small enough that search radii of 1-2 arcmin should be sufficient for
cross-matching under typical conditions. By examining bulk trends in amplitude
variability, we place upper limits on the modulation index associated with
ionospheric scintillation of 1-3% for the various nights. For sources fainter
than ~1 Jy, this variation is below the image noise at typical MWA
sensitivities. Our results demonstrate that the ionosphere is not a significant
impediment to the goals of time-domain science with the MWA at 154 MHz.

(SDOCT), much larger image datasets are routinely acquired compared to what was
possible using the previous generation of time-domain OCT. Thus, there is a
critical need for the development of 3D segmentation methods for processing
these data. We present here a novel 3D automatic segmentation method for
retinal OCT volume data. Briefly, to segment a boundary surface, two OCT volume
datasets are obtained by using a 3D smoothing filter and a 3D differential
filter. Their linear combination is then calculated to generate new volume data
with an enhanced boundary surface, where pixel intensity, boundary position
information, and intensity changes on both sides of the boundary surface are
used simultaneously. Next, preliminary discrete boundary points are detected
from the A-Scans of the volume data. Finally, surface smoothness constraints
and a dynamic threshold are applied to obtain a smoothed boundary surface by
correcting a small number of error points. Our method can extract retinal layer
boundary surfaces sequentially with a decreasing search region of volume data.
We performed automatic segmentation on eight human OCT volume datasets acquired
from a commercial Spectralis OCT system, where each volume of data consisted of
97 OCT images with a resolution of 496 512; experimental results show that this
method can accurately segment seven layer boundary surfaces in normal as well
as some abnormal eyes.

competitive equilibrium is Pareto-efficient in the absence of externalities and

its competitiveness, but the selection in turn affects the landscape of
competition. Such a feedback mechanism has been illustrated in a duopoly model
by Lambert et al., in which a buyer's satisfaction is updated depending on the
{\em freshness} of a purchased product. The probability for buyer $n$ to select
seller $i$ is assumed to be $p_{n,i} \propto e^{ S_{n,i}/T}$, where $S_{n,i}$

stochasticity. If $T$ decreases below a critical point $T_c$, the system
undergoes a transition from a symmetric phase to an asymmetric one, in which
only one of the two sellers is selected. In this work, we extend the model by
incorporating a simple price system. By considering a greed factor $g$ to
control how the satisfaction depends on the price, we argue the existence of an
oscillatory phase in addition to the symmetric and asymmetric ones in the
$(T,g)$ plane, and estimate the phase boundaries through mean-field
approximations. The analytic results show that the market preserves the
inherent symmetry between the sellers for lower $T$ in the presence of the
price system, which is confirmed by our numerical simulations.

other during the last stage of terrestrial planet formation called the giant
impact stage. Giant impacts eject a large amount of material from the colliding
protoplanets into the terrestrial planet region, which may form debris disks
with observable infrared excesses. Indeed, tens of warm debris disks around
young solar-type stars have been observed. Here, we quantitatively estimate the
total mass of ejected materials during the giant impact stages. We found that
$\sim$0.4 times the Earth's mass is ejected in total throughout the giant
impact stage. Ejected materials are ground down by collisional cascade until
micron-sized grains are blown out by radiation pressure. The depletion
timescale of these ejected materials is determined primarily by the mass of the
largest body among them. We conducted high-resolution simulations of giant
impacts to accurately obtain the mass of the largest ejected body. We then
calculated the evolution of the debris disks produced by a series of giant
impacts and depleted by collisional cascades to obtain the infrared excess
evolution of the debris disks. We found that the infrared excess is almost
always higher than the stellar infrared flux throughout the giant impact stage
($\sim$100 Myr) and is sometimes $\sim$10 times higher immediately after a
giant impact. Therefore, giant impact stages would explain the infrared excess
from most observed warm debris disks. The observed fraction of stars with warm
debris disks indicates that the formation probability of our solar system-like
terrestrial planets is approximately 10%.

show that a good atomistic understanding of the physical characteristics of
cuprous (Cu$_2$O) and cupric (CuO) oxide and of some key processes of their
formation has been obtained. Indeed, the growth of the oxide has been shown to
be epitaxial with the surface and to proceed, in most cases, through the
formation of oxide nano-islands which, with continuous oxygen exposure, grow
and eventually coalesce. We also show how electronic structure calculations
have become increasingly useful in helping to characterise the structures and
energetics of various Cu oxide surfaces. However a number of challenges remain.
For example, it is not clear under which conditions the oxidation of copper in
air at room temperature (known as native oxidation) leads to the formation of a
cuprous oxide film only, or also of a cupric overlayer. Moreover, the atomistic
details of the nucleation of the oxide islands are still unknown. We close our
review with a brief perspective on future work and discuss how recent advances
in experimental techniques, bringing greater temporal and spatial resolution,
along with improvements in the accuracy, realism and timescales achievable with

many areas of technology and everyday life. As such, considerable effort has
gone into understanding and preventing it. Organic molecule based coatings can
in certain circumstances act as effective corrosion inhibitors. Although they
have been used to great effect for more than sixty years, how they function at
the atomic-level is still a matter of debate. In this work, computer simulation
approaches based on density functional theory are used to investigate
benzotriazole (BTAH), one of the most widely used and studied corrosion
inhibitors for copper. In particular, the structures formed by protonated and
deprotonated BTAH molecules on Cu(111) have been determined and linked to their
inhibiting properties. It is found that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals
interactions and steric repulsions all contribute in shaping how BTAH molecules
adsorb, with flat-lying structures preferred at low coverage and upright
configurations preferred at high coverage. The interaction of the
dehydrogenated benzotriazole molecule (BTA) with the copper surface is instead
dominated by strong chemisorption via the azole moiety with the aid of copper
adatoms. Structures of dimers or chains are found to be the most stable
structures at all coverages, in good agreement with scanning tunnelling
microscopy results. Benzotriazole thus shows a complex phase behaviour in which
van der Waals forces play an important role and which depends on coverage and
on its protonation state and all of these factors feasibly contribute to its
effectiveness as a corrosion inhibitor.

depends only on the bodies' positions and momenta. Dirac delta distributions
are taken as source functions. Their full control is furnished by dimensional
continuation, by means of which the occurring ultraviolet (UV) divergences are
uniquely regularized. The applied near-zone expansion of the time-symmetric
Green function leads to infrared (IR) divergences. Their analytic
regularization results in one single ambiguity parameter. Unique fixation of it
was successfully performed in T.Damour, P.Jaranowski, and G.Sch\""afer, Phys.
Rev. D 89, 064058 (2014) through far-zone matching. Technically as well as
conceptually (backscatter binding energy), the level of the Lamb shift in
quantum electrodynamics is reached. In a first run a computation of all terms
is performed in three-dimensional space using analytic Riesz-Hadamard
regularization techniques. Then divergences are treated locally (i.e., around
particles' positions for UV and in the vicinity of spatial infinity for IR
divergences) by means of combined dimensional and analytic regularization.
Various evolved analytic expressions are presented for the first time. The
breakdown of the Leibniz rule for distributional derivatives is addressed as
well as the in general nondistributive law when regularizing value of products
of functions evaluated at their singular point.

focus on in this article: those that form the seeds for structure formation in
the early universe and those giving rise to Boltzmann brains in the late
universe. First, structure formation requires slight inhomogeneities in the
density of matter in the early universe, which then get amplified by the effect
of gravity, leading to clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. According to
inflation theory, quantum fluctuations form the seeds of these inhomogeneities.
However, these quantum fluctuations are described by a quantum state which is
homogeneous and isotropic, and this raises a problem, connected to the
foundations of quantum theory, as the unitary evolution alone cannot break the
symmetry of the quantum state. Second, Boltzmann brains are random agglomerates
of particles that, by extreme coincidence, form functioning brains. Unlikely as
these coincidences are, they seem to be predicted to occur in a quantum
universe as vacuum fluctuations if the universe continues to exist for an
infinite (or just very long) time, in fact to occur over and over, even forming
the majority of all brains in the history of the universe. We provide a brief
introduction to the Bohmian version of quantum theory and explain why in this
version, Boltzmann brains, an undesirable kind of fluctuation, do not occur (or
at least not often), while inhomogeneous seeds for structure formation, a
desirable kind of fluctuation, do.

acids of the constituting proteins. Therefore, epistasis is expected to evolve
amongst sites engaged in physical interactions, and to influence their
substitution rates. In order to study the distribution of structural epistasis,
we modeled \emph{in silico} the capsid of 18 species of the \phix \, family,
including the wild type. \phix \, is amongst the simplest organisms, making it
suitable for experimental evolution and \emph{in silico} modeling. We found
nearly 40 variable amino acid sites in the main capsid protein across the 18
species. To study how epistasis evolved in this group, we reconstructed the
ancestral sequences using a Bayesian phylogenetic framework. The ancestral
states include 8 variable amino acids, for a total of 256 possible haplotypes.
The $dN/dS$ ratio is low, suggesting strong purifying selection, consistent
with the idea that the structure is constrained by some form of stabilizing
selection. For each haplotype in the ancestral node and for the extant species
we estimated \emph{in silico} the distribution of free energies and of
epistasis. We found that free energy has not significantly increased but
epistasis has. We decomposed epistasis up to fifth order and found that
high-order epistasis can sometimes compensate pairwise interactions, often
making the free energy seem additive. By synthesizing some of the ancestral
haplotypes of the capsid gene, we measured their fitness experimentally, and
found that the predicted deviations in the coat protein free energy do not
significantly affect fitness, which is consistent with the stabilizing
selection hypothesis.

subspace of the input space such that the projected input variables preserve
maximal information about the output variables. The dependence maximization
approach solves the supervised dimension reduction problem through maximizing a
statistical dependence between projected input variables and output variables.
A well-known statistical dependence measure is mutual information (MI) which is
based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, it is known that the KL
divergence is sensitive to outliers. On the other hand, quadratic MI (QMI) is a
variant of MI based on the $L_2$ distance which is more robust against outliers
than the KL divergence, and a computationally efficient method to estimate QMI
from data, called least-squares QMI (LSQMI), has been proposed recently. For
these reasons, developing a supervised dimension reduction method based on
LSQMI seems promising. However, not QMI itself, but the derivative of QMI is
needed for subspace search in supervised dimension reduction, and the
derivative of an accurate QMI estimator is not necessarily a good estimator of
the derivative of QMI. In this paper, we propose to directly estimate the
derivative of QMI without estimating QMI itself. We show that the direct
estimation of the derivative of QMI is more accurate than the derivative of the
estimated QMI. Finally, we develop a supervised dimension reduction algorithm
which efficiently uses the proposed derivative estimator, and demonstrate
through experiments that the proposed method is more robust against outliers
than existing methods.

evidence for a correlation between radio luminosity and cluster X-ray

  We have now repeated the analysis with a low redshift sample (z~0.1), and
found strong correlations between radio luminosity and environment richness and
between radio luminosity and central density for the LERGs but not for the

from accretion discs maintained from local reservoirs of gas, while LERGs are
fuelled more directly by gas ingested from the intra-cluster medium.
  Comparing the samples, we found that although the maximum environment
richness of the HERG environments is similar in both samples, there are poorer
HERG environments in the z~0.1 sample than in the z~0.5 sample. We have
therefore tentative evidence of evolution of the HERG environments. We found no
differences between the LERG sub-samples for the two epochs, as would be

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv1829",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We perform a detailed X-ray study of the filaments surrounding the brightest
cluster galaxies in a sample of nearby galaxy clusters using deep Chandra
observations, namely the Perseus, Centaurus and Virgo clusters, and Abell 1795.
We compare the X-ray properties and spectra of the filaments in all of these
systems, and find that their Chandra X-ray spectra are all broadly consistent
with an absorbed two temperature thermal model, with temperature components at
0.75 and 1.7 keV. We find that it is also possible to model the Chandra ACIS
filament spectra with a charge exchange model provided a thermal component is
also present, and the abundance of oxygen is suppressed relative to the
abundance of Fe. In this model, charge exchange provides the dominant
contribution to the spectrum in the 0.5-1.0 keV band. However, when we study
the high spectral resolution RGS spectrum of the filamentary plume seen in
X-rays in Centaurus, the opposite appears to be the case. The properties of the
filaments in our sample of clusters are also compared to the X-ray tails of
galaxies in the Coma cluster and Abell 3627. In the Perseus cluster, we search
for signs of absorption by a prominent region of molecular gas in the
filamentary structure around NGC 1275. We do find a decrement in the X-ray
spectrum below 2 keV, indicative of absorption. However the spectral shape is
inconsistent with this decrement being caused by simply adding an additional
absorbing component. We find that the spectrum can be well fit (with physically
sensible parameters) with a model that includes both absorption by molecular
gas and X-ray emission from the filament, which partially counteracts the
absorption.

complicated process with strong, unsteady flow, high sediment transport, and
rapid bed changes in which the interactions between flow and morphology should
not be ignored. This study presents a depth-averaged two-dimensional (2D)
coupled flow and sediment transport model to investigate the flow and breaching
processes with and without waves. Bed change and variable flow density are
included in the flow continuity and momentum equations to consider the impacts
of sediment transport. The model adopts the non-equilibrium approach for
total-load sediment transport and specifies different repose angles to handle
non-cohesive embankment slope avalanching. The equations are solved using an
explicit finite volume method on a rectangular grid with the improved
Godunov-type central upwind scheme and the nonnegative reconstruction of the
water depth method to handle mixed-regime flows near the breach. The model has
been tested against two sets of experimental data which show that it well
simulates the flow characteristics, bed changes, and sediment transport. It is
then applied to analyze flow and morphologic changes by overtopping flow with
and without waves. The simulated bed change and breach cross-section shape show
a significant difference if waves are considered. Erosion by flow without waves
mainly occurs at the breach and is dominated by vertical erosion at the initial
stage followed by the lateral erosion. With waves, the flow overtops the entire
length of the dune to cause faster erosion along the entire length. Erosion
mainly takes place at the upper layer at the initial stage and gradually
accelerates as the height of the dune reduces and flow discharge increases,
which indicates the simulated results with waves shall be further verified by
physical experimental evidence.

regarding this problem and its variants, one basic shortcoming of the models is
that they lack the flexibility in the way the budget is allocated to
individuals. Indeed, budget allocation is a critical issue in advertising and
viral marketing. Taking the other point of view, known models allowing flexible
budget allocation do not take into account the influence spread in the network.
We introduce a generalized model that captures both budgets and influence
propagation simultaneously.
  For the offline setting, we identify a large family of budget-based
propagation functions that admit tight approximation guarantee. This family
extends most of the previously studied influence models, including the
well-known Triggering model. We establish that any function in this family
implies an instance of a monotone submodular function maximization over the
integer lattice subject to a knapsack constraint. This problem is known to
admit an optimal (1-1/e)-approximation. We also study the price of anarchy of
the multi-player game that extends the model and establish tight results.
  For the online setting, in which an unknown subset of agents arrive in a
random order and the algorithm needs to make an irrevocable budget allocation
in each step, we develop a 1/(15e)-competitive algorithm. This setting extends
the secretary problem, and its variant, the submodular knapsack secretary
problem. Notably, our algorithm improves over the best known approximation for
the latter problem, even though it applies to a more general setting.

known as the Hough transform to statistically analyse the herringbone fine

Solar-Terrestrial Observatory on 2011 September 22. We identify 188 individual
bursts which are signatures of bi-directional electron beams continuously
accelerated to speeds of 0.16$_{-0.10}^{+0.11} c$. This occurs at a shock
acceleration site initially at a constant altitude of $\sim$0.6 R$_{\odot}$ in
the corona, followed by a shift to $\sim$0.5 R$_{\odot}$. The anti-sunward
beams travel a distance of 170$_{-97}^{+174}$ Mm (and possibly further) away
from the acceleration site, while those travelling toward the sun come to a
stop sooner, reaching a smaller distance of 112$_{-76}^{+84}$ Mm. We show that
the stopping distance for the sunward beams may depend on the total number
density and the velocity of the beam. Our study concludes that a detailed

that the experimentally observed QPI peak around ${q}_2 = ( \pi, 0 )$ can be

Furthermore, we discuss the magnetic field dependence of the QPI by considering

found that at zero and low applied magnetic fields the tunneling spectra on NbN

in some cases, a zero-bias conductance peak. As the field increases to the
magnetic saturation of LCMO where the magnetization is homogeneous, the spectra
become more BCS-like and the critical temperature of the NbN increases,

average, jets during their propagation follow the magnetic field lines,
highlighting its local direction. The average jet deflection is studied both in
the plane perpendicular to the line of sight, and, for a reduced number of

We found that the propagation is not radial, in agreement with the deflection
due to magnetic field lines. Moreover, the amount of the deflection is
different between jets over the north and those from the south pole. Comparison
of jet deflections and field line tracing shows that a ratio g2/g1 ~ -0.5 for
the quadrupole and a ratio g3/g1 ~ 1.6-2.0 for the esapole can describe the

chemical abundances of extra-galactic post-AGB stars with the ultimate goal of
improving our knowledge of the poorly understood AGB third dredge-up mixing
processes and s-process nucleosynthesis. Aims: In this paper, we study two
carefully selected post-AGB stars in the LMC. The combination of favourable
atmospheric parameters for detailed abundance studies and their known distances
make these objects ideal probes of the internal AGB third dredge-up and
s-process nucleosynthesis in that they provide observational constraints for
theoretical AGB models. Methods: We use high-resolution optical UVES spectra to
determine accurate stellar parameters and perform detailed elemental abundance
studies. Additionally, we use available photometric data to construct SEDs for
reddening and luminosity determinations. We then estimate initial masses from
theoretical post-AGB tracks. Results: Both stars show extreme s-process
enrichment associated with relatively low C/O ratios of about 1.3. We could
only derive upper limits of the lead (Pb) abundance which indicate no strong Pb
overabundances with respect to other s-elements. Comparison with theoretical
post-AGB evolutionary tracks in the HR-diagram reveals that both stars have low
initial masses between 1.0 and 1.5 Msun. Conclusion: This study adds to the
results obtained so far on a very limited number of s-process enriched post-AGB
stars in the Magellanic Clouds. We find an increasing discrepancy between
observed and predicted Pb abundances towards lower metallicities for all
studied Magellanic Cloud post-AGB stars found so far, as well as moderate C/O
ratios. We find that all s-process rich post-AGB stars in the LMC and SMC
studied so far, cluster in the same region of the HR-diagram and are associated
with low-mass stars with a low metallicity on average.

high Jc junctions, when hysteretic, do not switch from the superconducting to
the normal state following the expected stochastic Josephson distribution,
despite having standard Josephson properties such as a Fraunhofer magnetic
field pattern. The switching current distributions (SCDs) are consistent with
nonequilibrium dynamics taking place on a local rather than a global scale.
This means that macroscopic quantum phenomena seem to be practically
unattainable for high Jc junctions. We argue that SCDs are an accurate means to
measure nonequilibrium effects. This transition from global to local dynamics
is of relevance for all kinds of weak links, including the emergent family of
nanohybrid Josephson junctions. Therefore caution should be applied in the use

Optimal Structured Signal Approximate Message Passing (BOSSAMP) - that jointly
exploits the prior distribution and the structured sparsity of a signal that
shall be recovered from noisy linear measurements. Structured sparsity is
inherent to group sparse and jointly sparse signals. Our algorithm is based on
approximate message passing that poses a low complexity recovery algorithm
whose Bayesian optimal version allows to specify a prior distribution for each
signal component. We utilize this feature in order to establish an
iteration-wise extrinsic group update step, in which likelihood ratios of
neighboring group elements provide soft information about a specific group
element. Doing so, the recovery of structured signals is drastically improved.
We derive the extrinsic group update step for a sparse binary and a sparse
Gaussian signal prior, where the nonzero entries are either one or Gaussian
distributed, respectively. We also explain how BOSSAMP is applicable to
arbitrary sparse signals. Simulations demonstrate that our approach exhibits
superior performance compared to the current state of the art, while it retains
a simple iterative implementation with low computational complexity.

dimensional predictor variables. One way to model the correlation among the
response variables is through the low rank decomposition of the coefficient
matrix, which has been considered by several papers for the high dimensional
predictors. However, all these papers focus on the singular value decomposition
of the coefficient matrix. Our target is the decomposition of the coefficient
matrix which leads to the best lower rank approximation to the regression
function, the signal part in the response. Given any rank, this decomposition
has nearly the smallest expected prediction error among all approximations to
the the coefficient matrix with the same rank. To estimate the decomposition,
we formulate a penalized generalized eigenvalue problem to obtain the first
matrix in the decomposition and then obtain the second one by a least squares
method. In the high-dimensional setting, we establish the oracle inequalities
for the estimates. Compared to the existing theoretical results, we have less
restrictions on the distribution of the noise vector in each observation and
allow correlations among its coordinates. Our theoretical results do not depend
on the dimension of the multivariate response. Therefore, the dimension is
arbitrary and can be larger than the sample size and the dimension of the
predictor. Simulation studies and application to real data show that the
proposed method has good prediction performance and is efficient in dimension
reduction for various reduced rank models.

in high dimension when there are only two classes. A major difficulty in
proving asymptotic optimality for multiclass classification is that the
classification boundary is typically complicated and no explicit formula for
classification error generally exists when the number of classes is greater
than two. For the Fisher's LDA, one additional difficulty is that the
covariance matrix is also involved in the linear constraints. The main purpose
of this paper is to establish asymptotic consistency and asymptotic optimality
for our sparse Fisher's LDA with thresholded linear constraints in the
high-dimensional settings for arbitrary number of classes. To address the first
difficulty above, we provide asymptotic optimality and the corresponding
convergence rates in high-dimensional settings for a large family of linear

to avoid the estimate of the covariance matrix. We apply the method to the

feedback from the planet, significantly limits its mass growth, keeping it
within the planetary mass regime (i.e. below the deuterium burning limit) at

any other gravitational action that departs from the Hilbert action, the
resulting entropy acquires an additional multiplicative factor that depends on
the global geometry of the background spacetime. On the other hand, the
generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) has extensively been recently used to
investigate corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, with the
conclusion that the latter always comes multiplied by a factor that depends on
the area of the event horizon. We show, by considering the case of an
