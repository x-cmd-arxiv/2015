study thermal transport in nanocrystalline graphene sheets. Nanostructured
graphene has been created using an iterative process for grain growth from
initial seeds with random crystallographic orientations. The resulting cells
have been characterized by the grain size distribution based on the radius of
gyration, by the number of atoms in each grain and by the number of atoms in
the grain boundary. Introduction of nanograins with a radius of gyration of 1
nm has led to a significant reduction in the thermal conductivity to 3% of the
value in single crystalline graphene. Analysis of the vibrational density of
states has revealed a general reduction of the vibrational intensities and
broadening of the peaks when nanograins are introduced which can be attributed
to phonon scattering in the boundary layer. The thermal conductivity has been
evaluated as a function of the grain size with increasing size up to 14 nm and
it has been shown to follow an inverse rational function. The grain size
dependent thermal conductivity could be approximated well by a function where
transport is described by a connection in series of conducting elements and
resistances (at boundaries).

scheme introduced by the authors, who also provided a rather involved

fixed number of messages and a random decision-time, and gave a simpler proof
establishing its optimality via a novel Shannon-Jensen divergence argument.
Another simpler optimality proof was given by Li and El Gamal, who considered a

Both these works also provided error exponent bounds. However, their simpler
achievability proofs apply only to discrete memoryless channels, and are
restricted to a non-sequential setup with a fixed number of messages. In this
paper, we provide a short and transparent proof for the optimality of the fully

photoluminescence in rare-earth elements, optical forces in optomechanics, and
the Brillouin scattering light-sound interaction. The net cooling of solids
through spontaneous Raman scattering, and laser refrigeration of indirect band
gap semiconductors, both remain unsolved challenges. Here, we analytically show
that photonic density of states (DoS) engineering can address the two
fundamental requirements for achieving spontaneous Raman cooling: suppressing
the dominance of Stokes (heating) transitions, and the enhancement of
anti-Stokes (cooling) efficiency beyond the natural optical absorption of the
material. We develop a general model for the DoS modification to spontaneous
Raman scattering probabilities, and elucidate the necessary and minimum
condition required for achieving net Raman cooling. With a suitably engineered
DoS, we establish the enticing possibility of refrigeration of intrinsic
silicon by annihilating phonons from all its Raman-active modes simultaneously,
through a single telecom wavelength pump. This result points to a highly
flexible approach for laser cooling of any transparent semiconductor, including
indirect band gap semiconductors, far away from significant optical absorption,

network to an equivalent process on an aggregated single-layer network. As a
typical example of models for opinion formation in social networks, we
implement the voter model on a two-layer multiplex network, and we study its
dynamics as a function of two control parameters, namely the fraction of edges
simultaneously existing in both layers of the network (edge overlap), and the
fraction of nodes participating in both layers (interlayer connectivity or
degree of multiplexity). We compute the asymptotic value of the number of
active links (interface density) in the thermodynamic limit, and the time to
reach an absorbing state for finite systems, and we compare the numerical
results with the analytical predictions on equivalent single-layer networks
obtained through various possible aggregation procedures. We find a large
region of parameters where the interface density of large multiplexes gives
systematic deviations from that of the aggregates. We show that neither of the
standard aggregation procedures is able to capture the highly nonlinear
increase in the lifetime of a finite size multiplex at small interlayer
connectivity. These results indicate that multiplexity should be appropriately
taken into account when studying voter model dynamics, and that, in general,
single-layer approximations might be not accurate enough to properly understand
processes occurring on multiplex networks, since they might flatten out

governing intermolecular diffusion. For small $l_D/l$ we find a diffuse
interface regime in which the slip length scales as $\xi \sim(l_Dl)^{1/2}$. For
larger $l_D/l>1$ we find a sharp interface regime in which the slip length
depends only on the diffusive length, $\xi \sim l_D \sim (M\eta)^{1/2}$, and
therefore only on the macroscopic variables $\eta$ and $M$, independent of the
microscopic interfacial width $l$. We also give evidence that modifying the
microscopic interfacial terms in the model's free energy functional appears to
affect the value of the slip length only the diffuse interface regime,
consistent with the slip length depending only on macroscopic variables in the
sharp interface regime. Finally, we demonstrate the dependence of the dynamic
contact angle on the capillary number to be in excellent agreement with the
theoretical prediction of \cite{Cox1986}, provided we allow the slip length to
be rescaled by a dimensionless prefactor. This prefactor appears to converge to
unity in the sharp interface limit, but is smaller in the diffuse interface
limit. The excellent agreement of results obtained using three independent

can be proved by using the multiplicity as main invariant. The proof of this
result leads to new questions in positive characteristic. We discuss here
results which follow by induction on the dimension of the varieties. Fix a
variety $X^{(d)}$ of dimension $d$ over a {\em perfect field} $k$ or, more
generally, a pure dimensional scheme of finite type over $k$. Fix a closed
point $x\in X^{(d)}$ of multiplicity $e>1$. Define a local simplification of
the multiplicity at $x\in X^{(d)}$ as a proper birational map, say
$X^{(d)}\leftarrow X^{(d)}_1$, where $X^{(d)}$ denotes now a neighborhood of
$x$, so that $X^{(d)}_1$ has multiplicity $<e$ at any point $x_1\in X^{(d)}_1$.
  Assume, by induction on $d$, the existence of local simplifications of the
multiplicity for schemes over $k$ of dimension $d'$, for all $d' <d$. We prove,
under this inductive assumption, that a local simplification at $x\in X^{(d)}$
can be constructed when $(C_{X,x})_{red}$ is not regular.
  Here $C_{X,x}$ denotes the tangent cone of $x\in X$, and $(C_{X,x})_{red}$ is
the reduced scheme. The paper uses classical results of commutative algebra,
and compares the effect of blowing up along equimultiple centers, and along
normally flat centers.

in terms of quantum criticality allow us to implement black hole mechanisms of
quantum computing within critical Bose-Einstein systems. The generic feature,
uncovered both by analytic and numeric studies, is the emergence at the
critical point of gapless weakly-interacting modes, which act as qubits for
information-storage at a very low energy cost. These modes can be effectively
described in terms of either Bogoliubov or Goldstone degrees of freedom. The
ground-state at the critical point is maximally entangled and far from being
classical. We confirm this near-critical behavior by a new analytic method. We
compute growth of entanglement and show its consistency with black hole type
behavior. On the other hand, in the over-critical regime the system develops a
Lyapunov exponent and scrambles quantum information very fast. By, manipulating
the system parameters externally, we can put it in and out of various regimes
and in this way control the sequence of information storage and processing. By
using gapless Bogoliubov modes as control qubits we design some simple logic
gates.

models of spinor condensates highlight the sensitivity of the quantum phases of
the system to the relative strength of the two-body interaction in the
different spin-channels. Such a description captures the regime where these
interactions are weak. In the opposite and largely unexplored regime of
strongly correlated spinor condensates, three-body interactions can play an
important role through the Efimov effect, producing possible novel phases.
Here, we study the three-body spinor problem using the hyperspherical adiabatic

suggests that Cooper pairs instead directly localize. The question of the
homogeneity, granularity, or possibly glassiness of the material on the verge
of this transition is intimately related to this fundamental issue. Here, by
combining macroscopic and nano-scale studies of superconducting ultrathin NbN

two-dimensional behaviour in the superconducting fluctuations, we demonstrate a
zero-dimensional regime for the thinner samples precisely on the scale of the
inhomogeneities. Such behavior is somehow intermediate between the Fermi and

galaxies or light is used, which makes our reconstruction unique in this

functions we conclude that overall light does follow mass. Furthermore, the
fact that brighter galaxies are more strongly clustered with mass is an
important confirmation of the standard biasing scenario in galaxy clusters. On
the smallest scales, approximately less than a few arcseconds, the resolution
afforded by 149 images is still not sufficient to confirm or rule out
galaxy-mass offsets of the kind observed in ACO 3827. We also compare the mass
maps of MACSJ0416 obtained by three different groups: Grale, and two parametric
Lenstool reconstructions from the CATS and Sharon/Johnson teams. Overall, the
three agree well; one interesting discrepancy between Grale and Lenstool
galaxy-mass correlation functions occurs on scales of tens of kpc and may
suggest that cluster galaxies are more biased tracers of mass than parametric

computes a local cluster in time that depends only logarithmically on the size
of the graph in the CONGEST model. In particular, when the value of the optimal
local cluster is known, the algorithm runs in time entirely independent of the
size of the graph and depends only on error bounds for approximation. We also
show that the local cluster problem can be computed in the k-machine
distributed model in sublinear time. The speedup of our local cluster
algorithms is mainly due to the use of our distributed algorithm for heat
kernel pagerank.

can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to
minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem
Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum
states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and
determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to
12 sites (24 spin-orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz
converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled
clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for
quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach
to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and
potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another
application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to
prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state

reminiscent of high-level cortical activity during behavioral tasks. However,
existing training methods for such networks are either biologically
implausible, or require a real-time continuous error signal to guide the
learning process. This is in contrast with most behavioral tasks, which only
provide time-sparse, delayed rewards. Here we show that a biologically
plausible reward-modulated Hebbian learning algorithm, previously used in
feedforward models of birdsong learning, can train recurrent networks based
solely on delayed, phasic reward signals at the end of each trial. The method
requires no dedicated feedback or readout networks: the whole network
connectivity is subject to learning, and the network output is read from one
arbitrarily chosen network cell. We use this method to successfully train a
network on a delayed nonmatch to sample task (which requires memory, flexible
associations, and non-linear mixed selectivities). Using decoding techniques,
we show that the resulting networks exhibit dynamic coding of task-relevant
information, with neural encodings of various task features fluctuating widely
over the course of a trial. Furthermore, network activity moves from a
stimulus-specific representation to a response-specific representation during
response time, in accordance with neural recordings in behaving animals for
similar tasks. We conclude that recurrent neural networks, trained with
reward-modulated Hebbian learning, offer a plausible model of cortical dynamics
during learning and performance of flexible association.

satellite on the continuum gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies

gamma-ray spectral features can be more stringent than the dSph bounds. This is
due to the Breit-Wigner enhancement near the ubiquitous resonances with a CP
even Higgs and the contribution of scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs final states
to box-shaped features. By contrast, for neutralino DM, the di-photon final
state is only enhanced in the resonance with a $Z$ boson and box-shaped
features are even more suppressed. Therefore, the observation of spectral
features could constitute a discriminating factor between both models. In

law. The log parabolic model describes the NuSTAR data, as well as previously
published gamma-ray data obtained with COMPTEL and AGILE, all together spanning
3 keV through 500 MeV. Our spectral modelling allows us to constrain the peak
of the broadband high energy spectrum to be at 2.6$\pm$0.8 MeV, an improvement
of nearly an order of magnitude in precision over previous measurements. In

measure the pulsed fraction of PSR B1509$-$58 in the hard X-ray energy band for

that the pulsar's off-pulse emission has a photon index value between 1.26 and

due to viewing geometry, with the X-rays originating from synchrotron emission

minimum uplink (UL) rate constraint, and concludes: mmW tends to focus more on
DL transmissions while {\mu}W has high priority for complementing UL, under
time-division duplex (TDD) mmW operations. Such UL dedication of {\mu}W results
from the limited use of mmW UL bandwidth due to excessive power consumption
and/or high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) at mobile users. To further
relieve this UL bottleneck, we propose mmW UL decoupling that allows each

of cosmological horizons. Still for $a^{2}\Lambda \ll 1$, but assuming that
either $M^{2}> \frac {1}{9\Lambda}[1+2a^{2}\Lambda+O(a^{2}\Lambda)^{2})]$ or

of the cosmological horizons coincide. However, we found that this coalescence
occurs provided $M^{2}\Lambda \sim 1$ and due to the observed smallness of
$\Lambda$, these configurations are probably irrelevant in astrophysical
settings. Extreme black holes, i.e. black holes where the inner horizon
coincides with the outer black hole horizon are also admitted. We have found
that in the limit $M^{2}\Lambda \ll 1$ and $a^{2}\Lambda \ll 1$, extreme black
holes occur, provided $a^{2}=M^{2}(1+O(\Lambda M^{2}))$. Finally a coalescence
between the outer and the cosmological horizon, although in principle possible,
is likely to be unimportant at the astrophysical level, since this requires
$M^{2}\Lambda \sim 1$.

non-Hermicity as the $\cal PT$-symmetric perturbation grows, which are

reproduces key galaxy observables including the stellar mass-halo mass,
Tully-Fisher, and mass-metallicity relations. We quantify the importance of
ejective feedback to setting the stellar mass relative to the efficiency of gas
accretion and star formation. Ejective feedback is increasingly important as
galaxy mass decreases; we find an effective mass loading factor that scales as
v_circ^(-2.2), with an amplitude and shape that is invariant with redshift.
These scalings are consistent with analytic models for energy-driven wind,
based solely on the halo potential. Recycling is common: about half the outflow
mass across all galaxy masses is later re-accreted. The recycling timescale is
typically about 1 Gyr, virtually independent of halo mass. Recycled material is
re-accreted farther out in the disk and with typically about 2-3 times more
angular momentum. These results elucidate and quantify how the baryon cycle
plausibly regulates star formation and alters the angular momentum distribution

super-Planckian. In string theory only sub-Planckian axion decay constants have
been found in any controlled regime. However in field theory it is possible to
generate an enhanced super-Planckian decay constant by an appropriate aligned
mixing between axions with individual sub-Planckian decay constants. We study
the possibility of such a mechanism in string theory. In particular we
construct a new realisation of an alignment scenario in type IIA string theory
compactifications on a Calabi-Yau where the alignment is induced through
fluxes. Within field theory the original decay constants are taken to be
independent of the parameters which induce the alignment. In string theory
however they are moduli dependent quantities and so interact gravitationally
with the physics responsible for the mixing. We show that this gravitational
effect of the fluxes on the moduli can precisely cancel any enhancement of the
effective decay constant. This censorship of an effective super-Planckian decay
constant depends on detailed properties of Calabi-Yau moduli spaces and occurs
for all the examples and classes that we study. We expand these results to a
general superpotential assuming only that the axion superpartners are fixed
supersymmetrically and are able to show for a large class of Calabi-Yau
manifolds, but not all, that the cancellation effect occurs and is independent
of the superpotential. We also study simple models where the moduli are fixed
non-supersymmetrically and find that similar cancellation behaviour can emerge.
Finally we make some comments on a possible generalisation to axion monodromy
inflation models.

in the analysis is the careful treatment of a Lichnerowicz-type `no-hair'
theorem. From a Frobenius analysis of the asymptotic small-radius behaviour,
the solution space is found to split into three asymptotic families, one of
which contains the classic Schwarzschild solution. These three families are
carefully analysed to determine the corresponding numbers of free parameters in
each. One solution family is capable of arising from coupling to a
distributional shell of matter near the origin; this family can then match on
to an asymptotically flat solution at spatial infinity without encountering a
horizon. Another family, with horizons, contains the Schwarzschild solution but
includes also non-Schwarzschild black holes. The third family of solutions
obtained from the Frobenius analysis is nonsingular and corresponds to `vacuum'
solutions. In addition to the three families identified from near-origin
behaviour, there are solutions that may be identified as `wormholes', which can
match symmetrically on to another sheet of spacetime at finite radius.

analysis recovers the leading type of fluctuation even in the presence of
projection effects and temperature gradients. We confirm the isobaric nature of
cool filaments of gas entrained by buoyantly rising bubbles, extending to 7' to
the east and south-west, and the adiabatic nature of the weak shocks at 40"" and
3' from the center. For features of 5--10 kpc, we show that the central 4'x 4'
region is dominated by cool structures in pressure equilibrium with the ambient
hotter gas while up to 30 percent of the variance in this region can be
ascribed to adiabatic fluctuations. The remaining part of the central 14'x14'
region, excluding the arms and shocks described above, is dominated by
apparently isothermal fluctuations (bubbles) with a possible admixture (at the
level of about 30 percent) of adiabatic (sound waves) and by isobaric
structures. Larger features, of about 30 kpc, show a stronger contribution from
isobaric fluctuations. The results broadly agree with an AGN feedback model
mediated by bubbles of relativistic plasma.

Previous studies using fiber spectra indicated that lower surface brightness

results were uncertain because of aperture effect. With stellar masses and
surface brightnesses measured at WISE W1 and W2 bands, we re-investigate the
surface brightness dependence with spatially-resolved metallicity profiles and
find the similar result. We further demonstrate that the systematical
difference cannot be explained by the gas content of galaxies. For two galaxies
with similar stellar and gas masses, the one with lower surface brightness
tends to have lower metallicity. Using chemical evolution models, we
investigate the inflow and outflow properties of galaxies of different masses
and surface brightnesses. We find that, on average, high mass galaxies have
lower inflow and outflow rates relative to star formation rate. On the other
hand, lower surface brightness galaxies experience stronger inflow than higher
surface brightness galaxies of similar mass. The surface brightness effect is
more significant for low mass galaxies. We discuss implications on the
different inflow properties between low and high surface brightness galaxies,
including star formation efficiency, environment and mass assembly history.

proof is divided in three parts. First we see that Besov functions in $F$ are
restrictions of functions of the same type (but greater regularity) in $X$,
that is we prove an Extension theorem. Next, as an auxiliary result that can
also be interesting on its own, we show that the interpolation between certain
potential spaces gives a Besov space. Finally, to obtain that Besov functions
in $X$ can in fact be restricted to $F$, a Restriction theorem, we first prove
that this result holds for functions in the potential space, and then by the
interpolation result previously shown, it must hold in the Besov case. For the
interpolation and restriction theorems, we make additional assumptions on the

turbulent field in the infalling gas. We initially set a gaseous shell in
non-equilibrium rotation around a supermassive black hole. After infall, the
shell stalls in a disc-like structure. A second shell is then set in either
co-rotation or counter-rotation with respect to the first and is let to impinge
on the previously-formed disc. We find that combined turbulence and overlap
significantly enhance accretion in counter-rotating inflows, while turbulence
dominates for co-rotating inflows. The leftovers of overlapping inflows are
warped nuclear discs, whose morphology depends on the relative orientation and
angular momentum of the disc and the shell. Overlapping inflows leave
observational signatures in the gas rotation curves.

presented a multitracer forecast as Figures of Merit (FoM), combining a
photometric and spectroscopic stage-IV survey. The uncertainties from galaxy
bias, the way light traces mass, is an important ingredient in the forecast.
Fixing the bias would increase our FoM equivalent to 3.3 times larger area for
the combined constraints. This paper focus on how the modelling of bias affect
these results. In the combined forecast, lensing both help and benefit from the
improved bias measurements in overlapping surveys after marginalizing over the
cosmological parameters. Adding a second lens population in counts-shear does
not have a large impact on bias error, but removing all counts-shear
information increases the bias error in a significant way. We also discuss the
relative impact of WL, magnification, RSD and BAO, and how results change as a
function of bias amplitude, photo-z error and sample density. By default we use
one bias parameter per bin (with 72 narrow bins), but we show that the results
do not change much when we use other parameterizations, with at least 3
parameters in total. Bias stochasticity, even when added as one new free
parameter per bin, only produce moderate decrease in the FoM. In general, we
find that the degradation in the figure of merit caused by the uncertainties in
the knowledge of bias is significantly smaller for overlapping surveys.

broken symmetry. It is present even in the hard-edge limit, and moreover, the
other (soft-edge) effects can be simply ascribed to the intrinsic aberration

proofs are wrong. The paper was withdrawn from submission> One of the
objectives of a Delaunay mesh refinement algorithm is to produce meshes with
tetrahedral elements having a bounded aspect ratio, which is the ratio between
the radius of the circumscribing and inscribing spheres. The refinement is
carried out by inserting additional Steiner vertices inside the circumsphere of
a poor-quality tetrahedron (to remove the tetrahedron) at a sufficient distance
from existing vertices to guarantee the termination and size optimality of the
algorithm. This technique eliminates tetrahedra whose ratio of the radius of
the circumscribing sphere and the shortest side, the radius-edge ratio, is
large. Slivers, almost-planar tetrahedra, which have a small radius-edge ratio,
but a large aspect ratio, are avoided by small random perturbations of the
Steiner vertices to improve the aspect ratio. Additionally, geometric
constraints, called ""petals"", have been shown to produce smaller high-quality
meshes in 2D Delaunay refinement algorithms. In this paper, we develop a
deterministic nondifferentiable optimization routine to place the Steiner
vertex inside geometrical constraints that we call ""snow globes"" for 3D
Delaunay refinement. We explore why the geometrical constraints and an ordering
on processing of poor-quality tetrahedra result in smaller meshes. The stricter
analysis provides an improved constant associated with the size optimality of
the generated meshes. Aided by the analysis, we present a modified algorithm to
handle boundary encroachment. The final algorithm behaves like an
advancing-front algorithms that are commonly used for quadrilateral and
hexahedral meshing.

and displacement measurements. For nanomechanical transducers, there is usually
a trade-off between the frequency ($f_{M}$) and quality factor ($Q_{M}$), which
limits temporal resolution and sensitivity. Here, we present a monolithic
cavity optomechanical transducer supporting both high $f_{M}$ and high $Q_{M}$.
By replacing the common doubly-clamped, Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam with a tuning fork
geometry, we demonstrate devices with the fundamental $f_{M}\approx29$ MHz and
$Q_{M}\approx2.2$$\times10^5$, corresponding to an $f_{M}Q_{M}$ product of
6.35$\times10^{12}$ Hz, comparable to the highest values previously
demonstrated for room temperature operation. This high $f_{M}Q_{M}$ product is
partly achieved by engineering the stress of the tuning fork to be 3 times the
residual film stress through clamp design, which results in an increase of
$f_{M}$ up to 1.5 times. Simulations reveal that the tuning fork design
simultaneously reduces the clamping, thermoelastic dissipation, and intrinsic
material damping contributions to mechanical loss. This work may find
application when both high temporal and force resolution are important, such as
in compact sensors for atomic force microscopy.

distribution of the $M/G/\infty$ queue from incomplete data on the queue. The
goal is to estimate $G$ from observations of the queue--length process at the
points of the regular grid on a fixed time interval. We propose an estimator
and analyze its accuracy over a family of target service time distributions.
The original $M/G/\infty$ problem is closely related to the problem of
estimating derivatives of the covariance function of a stationary Gaussian
process. We consider the latter problem and derive lower bounds on the minimax
risk. The obtained results strongly suggest that the proposed estimator of the
service time distribution is rate optimal.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1003.5966 by other authors",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The 5G wireless network architecture will bring dense deployments of base
stations called {\em small cells} for both outdoors and indoors traffic. The
feasibility of their dense deployments depends on the existence of a high
data-rate transport network that can provide high-data backhaul from an
aggregation node where data traffic originates and terminates, to every such
small cell. Due to the limited range of radio signals in the high frequency
bands, multihop wireless connection may need to be established between each
access node and an aggregation node. In this paper, we present a novel
transmission scheme for wireless multihop backhaul for 5G networks. The scheme
consists of 1) {\em group successive relaying} that established a relay
schedule to efficiently exploit half-duplex relays and 2) an optimized
quantize-map-and-forward (QMF) coding scheme that improves the performance of
QMF and reduces the decoding complexity and the delay. We derive an achievable
rate region of the proposed scheme and attain a closed-form expression in the
asymptotic case for several network models of interests. It is shown that the
proposed scheme provides a significant gain over multihop routing (based on
decode-and-forward), which is a solution currently proposed for wireless
multihop backhaul network. Furthermore, the performance gap increases as a
network becomes denser. For the proposed scheme, we then develop
energy-efficient routing that determines {\em groups} of participating relays
for every hop. To reflect the metric used in the routing algorithm, we refer to
it as {\em interference-harnessing} routing. By turning interference into a
useful signal, each relay requires a lower transmission power to achieve a
desired performance compared to other routing schemes. Finally, we present a
low-complexity successive decoder, which makes it feasible to use the proposed
scheme in practice.

cyber-physical system at runtime, which is often achieved by verifying
properties over the observed trace of system execution. However, this
verification is facing severe challenges. First, in realistic settings, the
computing entities only have imperfectly synchronized clocks. A proper timing
model is essential to the interpretation of the trace of system execution.
Second, the specification should be able to express properties with real-time
constraints despite the asynchrony, and the semantics should be interpreted
over the currently-observed and continuously-growing trace. To address these
challenges, we propose PARO - the partially synchronous system observation
framework, which i) adopts the partially synchronous model of time, and
introduces the lattice and the timed automata theories to model the trace of
system execution; ii) adopts a tailored subset of TCTL to specify temporal
properties, and defines the 3-valued semantics to interpret the properties over
the currently-observed finite trace; iii) constructs the timed automaton
corresponding to the trace at runtime, and reduces the satisfaction of the
3-valued semantics over finite traces to that of the classical boolean
semantics over infinite traces. PARO is implemented over MIPA - the open-source

none studied their interactive effects while the GA is under different problem
sizes. In this paper, We present the use of experimental model (1)~to
investigate whether the genetic operators and their parameters interact to
affect the offline performance of GA, (2)~to find what combination of genetic
operators and parameter settings will provide the optimum performance for GA,
and (3)~to investigate whether these operator-parameter combination is
dependent on the problem size. We designed a GA to optimize a family of
traveling salesman problems (TSP), with their optimal solutions known for
convenient benchmarking. Our GA was set to use different algorithms in
simulating selection ($\Omega_s$), different algorithms ($\Omega_c$) and
parameters ($p_c$) in simulating crossover, and different parameters ($p_m$) in
simulating mutation. We used several $n$-city TSPs ($n=\{5, 7, 10, 100,
1000\}$) to represent the different problem sizes (i.e., size of the resulting
search space as represented by GA schemata). Using analysis of variance of
3-factor factorial experiments, we found out that GA performance is affected by
$\Omega_s$ at small problem size (5-city TSP) where the algorithm Partially
Matched Crossover significantly outperforms Cycle Crossover at $95\%$
confidence level.

Zn vacancy (VZn) is preferentially aggregated at the GB, relative to the

defect-free GB, VZn induces spin polarization as large as 0.68 {\mu}B/atom to

can learn invariance to a wide range of non-linear distortions such as
rotation, viewpoint angle or lighting condition. In this work, new insights are
discovered about CNN embeddings and a new loss function is proposed, derived
from the contrastive loss, that creates models with more predicable mappings

is no simple relation between the features corresponding to one image and the
features of this image distorted. Therefore, these methods require to
feed-forward inputs under every distortions in order to find the corresponding

of eavesdropper antennas to be known. Although this assumption allows one to
easily compute the achievable secrecy rate, it can hardly be realized in
practice. In this paper, we provide an innovative approach to study secure
communication systems without knowing the number of eavesdropper antennas by
introducing the concept of spatial constraint into physical layer security.
Specifically, the eavesdropper is assumed to have a limited spatial region to
place (possibly an infinite number of) antennas. From a practical point of
view, knowing the spatial constraint of the eavesdropper is much easier than
knowing the number of eavesdropper antennas. We derive the achievable secrecy
rates of the spatially-constrained system with and without friendly jamming. We
show that a non-zero secrecy rate is achievable with the help of a friendly
jammer, even if the eavesdropper places an infinite number of antennas in its
spatial region. Furthermore, we find that the achievable secrecy rate does not
monotonically increase with the jamming power, and hence, we obtain the
closed-form solution of the optimal jamming power that maximizes the secrecy
rate.

to measure the models' ability to predict human judgments about lexical

in this paper is to build a unifying picture of the underlying magnetic
degrees-of-freedom on kagome. Motivated by a growing mosaic of materials, we
especially consider a broad range of nearest-neighbour interactions consisting
of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya as well as anisotropic ferro$-$ and antiferromagnetic
coupling. We present a three-fold mapping on the kagome lattice which
transforms the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet and XXZ model onto two
lines of time-reversal invariant Hamiltonians. The mapping is exact for
classical and quantum spins alike, i.e. it preserves the energy spectrum of the
original Heisenberg and XXZ models. As a consequence, at the classical level,
all phases have an extensive ground-state degeneracy. These ground states
support a variety of phenomena such as ferromagnetically induced pinch points
in the structure factor and the possibility for spontaneous scalar chirality.
For quantum spin$-1/2$, the XXZ model has been recently shown to be a quantum
spin liquid. Applying our three-fold mapping to the XXZ model gives rise to a
connected network of quantum spin liquids, centered around a paragon of quantum
disorder, namely the Ising antiferromagnet. We show that this quantum disorder
spreads over an extended region of the phase diagram at linear order in spin
wave theory, which overlaps with the parameter region of Herbertsmithite
ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. We conclude this work by discussing the connection of
our results to the chiral spin liquids found on kagome with further
nearest-neighbour interactions, and to the recently synthesized ternary

planning. However, its performance is limited in terms of data rate and
latency. Free Space Optical (FSO) backhaul, on the other hand, offers a higher
data rate but is sensitive to weather conditions. To combine the advantages of
RF and FSO backhauls, this paper proposes a cost-efficient backhaul network
using the hybrid RF/FSO technology. To ensure a resilient backhaul, the paper
imposes a given degree of redundancy by connecting each node through $K$
link-disjoint paths so as to cope with potential link failures. Hence, the
network planning problem considered in this paper is the one of minimizing the
total deployment cost by choosing the appropriate link type, i.e., either
hybrid RF/FSO or optical fiber (OF), between each couple of base-stations while
guaranteeing $K$ link-disjoint connections, a data rate target, and a
reliability threshold. The paper solves the problem using graph theory
techniques. It reformulates the problem as a maximum weight clique problem in
the planning graph, under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF
and hybrid RF/FSO links. Simulation results show the cost of the different

embeddings from a Riemannian manifold $M^n$ into $\mathbb{E}^N$ is $C^0$-dense
within the collection of all smooth 1-Lipschitz embeddings provided that $n <
N$. This result is now known to be a consequence of Gromov's more general
$h$-principle. There have been some recent extensions of the Nash-Kuiper
Theorem to Euclidean polyhedra, which in some sense provide a very specialized
discretization of the $h$-principle. In this paper we will discuss these recent
results and provide generalizations to the setting of isometric embeddings of
spaces endowed with indefinite metrics into Minkowski space. The new
observation is that, when dealing with Minkowski space, the assumption
""1-Lipschitz"" can be removed. Thus, we obtain results about isometric
embeddings that are $C^0$-dense within the collection of {\it all} continuous
maps.

language evolution. We treat binary syntactic parameters as spin states, with
languages as vertices of a graph, and assigned interaction energies along the
edges. We study a rough model of syntax evolution, under the assumption that a
strong interaction energy tends to cause parameters to align, as in the case of
ferromagnetic materials. We also study how the spin glass model needs to be
modified to account for entailment relations between syntactic parameters. This
modification leads naturally to a generalization of Potts models with external
magnetic field, which consists of a coupling at the vertices of an Ising model
and a Potts model with q=3, that have the same edge interactions. We describe
the results of simulations of the dynamics of these models, in different
temperature and energy regimes. We discuss the linguistic interpretation of the
parameters of the physical model.

investigate the effects of viscoelasticity on the break-up of liquid threads in
microfluidic cross-junctions, where droplets are formed by focusing a liquid
thread of a dispersed (d) phase into another co-flowing continuous (c)
immiscible phase. Working at small Capillary numbers, we investigate the
effects of non-Newtonian phases in the transition from droplet formation at the
cross-junction (DCJ) to droplet formation downstream of the cross-junction (DC)
(Liu $\&$ Zhang, ${\it Phys. ~Fluids.}$ ${\bf 23}$, 082101 (2011)). We will
analyze cases with ${\it Droplet ~Viscoelasticity}$ (DV), where viscoelastic
properties are confined in the dispersed phase, as well as cases with ${\it
Matrix ~Viscoelasticity}$ (MV), where viscoelastic properties are confined in
the continuous phase. Moderate flow-rate ratios $Q \approx {\cal O}(1)$ of the
two phases are considered in the present study. Overall, we find that the
effects are more pronounced in the case with MV, where viscoelasticity is found
to influence the break-up point of the threads, which moves closer to the
cross-junction and stabilizes. This is attributed to an increase of the polymer
feedback stress forming in the corner flows, where the side channels of the
device meet the main channel. Quantitative predictions on the break-up point of
the threads are provided as a function of the Deborah number, i.e. the
dimensionless number measuring the importance of viscoelasticity with respect
to Capillary forces.

governing the infall dynamics of the stellar core, triggering and fueling the
explosion and driving the cooling and deleptonization of the newly formed
neutron star. Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of
the explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only
direct probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova.
In this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics
and signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the
capability of current and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield
faithful information of the time and flavor dependent neutrino signal from a
future Galactic supernova. We show how the observable neutrino burst would
provide a benchmark for fundamental supernova physics with unprecedented
richness of detail. Exploiting the treasure of the measured neutrino events
requires a careful discrimination of source-generated properties from signal
features that originate on the way to the detector. As for the latter, we
discuss self-induced flavor conversions associated with neutrino-neutrino
interactions that occur in the deepest stellar regions; matter effects that
modify the pattern of flavor conversions in the dynamical stellar envelope;
neutrino-oscillation signatures that result from structural features associated
with the shock-wave propagation as well as turbulent mass motions in post-shock
layers. Finally, we highlight our current understanding of the formation of the
diffuse supernova neutrino background and we analyse the perspectives for a
detection of this relic signal that integrates the contributions from all past
core-collapse supernovae in the Universe.

economic counterpart. In the present paper we fill this gap and employ the
theoretical tools of network theory to shed light on the response of world
trade to the financial crisis of 2007 and the economic recession of 2008-2009.
We have explored the evolution of the bipartite World Trade Web (WTW) across
the years 1995-2010, monitoring the behavior of the system both before and
after 2007. Our analysis shows early structural changes in the WTW topology:
since 2003, the WTW becomes increasingly compatible with the picture of a
network where correlations between countries and products are progressively
lost. Moreover, the WTW structural modification can be considered as concluded
in 2010, after a seemingly stationary phase of three years. We have also
refined our analysis by considering specific subsets of countries and products:
the most statistically significant early-warning signals are provided by the
most volatile macrosectors, especially when measured on developing countries,
suggesting the emerging economies as being the most sensitive ones to the
global economic cycles.

tunable and modulated transmission at near-infrared (near-IR) frequencies. The
proposed device is constituted by periodic pairs of asymmetric silicon nanobars
placed over a silica substrate. An one-atom-thick graphene sheet is positioned
between the nanobars and the substrate. The in-plane electromagnetic fields are
highly localized and enhanced with this all-dielectric metasurface due to its
zero Ohmic losses at near-IR wavelengths. They strongly interact with graphene
and couple to its properties. Sharp Fano transmission is obtained at the
resonant frequency of this hybrid all-dielectric metasurface configuration due
to the cancelation of the electric and magnetic dipole responses at this
frequency point. The properties of the graphene monolayer flake can be adjusted
by tuning its Fermi energy or chemical potential, leading to different doping
levels and, equivalently, material parameters. As a result, the Q factor and
the Fano resonant transmission spectrum of the proposed hybrid system can be
efficiently tuned and controlled due to the strong light graphene interaction.
Higher than 60 percent modulation in the transmission coefficient is reported
at near-IR frequencies. The proposed hybrid graphene/dielectric nanodevice has
compact footprint, ultrafast speed, and can be easily integrated to the current
CMOS technology. These features would have promising applications to near-IR
tunable filters, faster optical interconnects, efficient sensors, switches, and
amplitude modulators.
