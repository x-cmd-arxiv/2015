the two strongest maser peaks, the expansion velocity of the shell, and the
radial velocity of the star. Links are provided for about 100 stars ($<$5\% of
all stars with OH masers) to interferometric observations and monitoring
programs of the maser emission published since their beginnings in the 1970s.
Access to the database is possible over the Web
(www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/maserdb), allowing cone searches for individual sources
and lists of sources. A general search is possible in selected regions of the

during its initial evolution. It reveals the presence of pre-existing
circumstellar material around the nova, which is best interpreted as the wind
of an evolved companion. On earliest observations, the emission line profiles
of Nova Oph 2015 displayed a very narrow emission component (FWHM~60 km/s),
recombining over a time scale of 5 days and showing constant low velocity
(RV_sun= -4.5 km/s), that we interpret as coming from the wind of the secondary
recombining after the ionization from the initial UV-flash of the nova. The
underlying broad component underwent a marked reduction in both FWHM and width
at zero intensity (the latter declining from 4000 to 2000 km/s in ten days)
while increasing by 6 times in flux, that we believe is the result of the high
velocity ejecta of the nova being slowed down while trying to expand within the
surrounding wind of the companion. Novae with evolved secondaries are very rare
in the Galaxy, amounting 3% of the total according to recent estimates. Among
them Nova Oph 2015 is perhaps unique in having displayed a long rise to maximum
brightness and a slow decline from it, a FeII-type classification (contrary to
prevailing He/N) and a probable sub-giant luminosity class for the secondary
(instead of the giant (e.g. RS Oph) or supergiant (e.g. V407 Cyg) class for the

Nov 20.52 UT, with a magnitude of m_R = 17.84 +/- 0.19. The sequence of seven
eruptions shows significant indications of a duty cycle slightly shorter than
one year, which makes successive eruptions occur progressively earlier in the
year. We compared three archival X-ray detections with the well observed
multi-wavelength light curve of the 2014 eruption to accurately constrain the

fact a recurrence period of ~6 months (175 +/- 11 days), making it even more

air-Cherenkov and scintillator detectors, respectively, placed in the Tunka
valley, Siberia. Triggered by these detectors, Tunka-Rex measures the radio
signal up to EeV-scale air-showers. This configuration provides a unique
possibility for cross-calibration between air-Cherenkov, radio and particle
techniques. We present reconstruction methods for the energy and the shower
maximum developed with CoREAS simulations, which allow for a precision
competitive with the air-Cherenkov technique. We apply these methods to data
acquired by Tunka-Rex in the first year which we use for cross-calibration, and
we compare the results with the reconstruction of the energy and the shower
maximum by Tunka-133, which provides also a reconstruction for the shower core
used for the radio reconstruction. Our methods have shown that the atmospheric
depth of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$) can be reconstructed with a
precision of better than 40 g/cm$^2$ for high quality events, in some cases
even when only three antenna stations have signal. The energy precision is
comparable with the air-Cherenkov precision of 15%. Soon the results will be

of the lightest right-handed neutrino can be enhanced in the model because it
has a lot of mass terms whose mass parameters are predicted to be the same
order of magnitude which is smaller than $10^8$ GeV. We show that O(10)
enhancement for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass is sufficient for the
observed baryon asymmetry. Note that such mass enhancements do not change the
predictions of neutrino masses and mixings at the low energy scale in the $E_6$

effects of supersymmetry and flavor in final states of the right-handed

even in the strong washout regime when the effect of flavor is included. This
is because the washout effects on the asymmetries both of the muon and the

between a detector and a quantum field and between two detectors mediated by a
quantum field. Nontrivial topology refers to both that of the base space and
that of the bundle. Using a derivative-coupling Unruh-DeWitt-like detector
model interacting with a quantum scalar field in an Einstein cylinder S1
(space) x R1 (time), we see the beating behaviors in the dynamics of the
detector-field entanglement and the detector-detector entanglement, which
distinguish from the results in the non-compact (1+1) dimensional Minkowski
space. The beat patterns of entanglement dynamics in a normal and a twisted
field with the same parameter values are different because of the difference in
the spectrum of the field modes. In terms of the kinetic momentum of the
detectors, we find that the contribution by the zero mode in a normal field to
entanglement dynamics has no qualitative difference from those by the nonzero
modes.

measurements of the orbital inclination $i_{\rm p}$ to the plane of the sky and
of the sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment $\lambda$ at two epochs about six
years apart allowed for the determination of the longitude of the ascending
node $\Omega$ and of the orbital inclination $I$ to the apparent equatorial

$\dot\Omega_{\rm exp},~\dot I_{\rm exp}$ of this two orbital elements, accurate
to a $\approx 10^{-2}~{\rm deg}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ level, were calculated as well.
By comparing them to general theoretical expressions $\dot\Omega_{J_2},~\dot
I_{J_2}$ for their precessions induced by an oblate star whose symmetry axis is
arbitrarily oriented, we were able to determine the angle $i^{\star}$ between
the line of sight the star's spin $S^{\star}$ and its first even zonal harmonic
$J_2^{\star}$ obtaining $i^{\star} = 142^{+10}_{-11}~{\rm deg},~J_2^{\star} =

Tracing in even the smallest portions of neuropil requires copious human
annotation, the rate-limiting step for generating a connectome. While a
combination of improved imaging and automatic segmentation will lead to the
analysis of increasingly large volumes, machines still fail to reach the
quality of human tracers. Unfortunately, small errors in image segmentation can
lead to catastrophic distortions of the connectome.
  In this paper, to analyze very large datasets, we explore different
mechanisms that are less sensitive to errors in automation. Namely, we advocate
and deploy extensive synapse detection on the entire antennal lobe (AL)
neuropil in the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila, a region much larger than
any densely annotated to date. The resulting synapse point cloud produced is
invaluable for determining compartment boundaries in the AL and choosing
specific regions for subsequent analysis. We introduce our methodology in this
paper for region selection and show both manual and automatic synapse
annotation results. Finally, we note the correspondence between image datasets
obtained using the synaptic marker, antibody nc82, and our datasets enabling

Moreover, the Balmer profiles of this system acquired additional satellite
components indicating bipolar collimated outflow at one time between the first

the model of collimated stellar wind from the outbursting object. It is
supposed that one extended disc-like envelope covering the accretion disc of
the compact object and collimating its stellar wind forms in the period between
the first and second minima. The uneclipsed part of this envelope is
responsible for the decrease of the depth of the orbital minimum. The
calculated $UBVR_{C}I_{C}$ fluxes of this uneclipsed part are in agreement with
the observed residual of the depths of the first and second orbital minima. The
parameters of the envelope require that it is the main emitting region of the
line H$\alpha$ but the H$\alpha$ profile is less determined from its rotation
and mostly from other mechanisms. It is concluded that the envelope is a
transient nebular region and its destruction determines the increase of the
depth of the orbital minimum with fading of the optical light.

An efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm is proposed for posterior inference.
Using the small-variance asymptotics of our probabilistic model, we then derive
a new deterministic clustering algorithm (RDP-means). It can be viewed as an
extension of K-means that allows for the inclusion of side information and has
the additional property that the number of clusters does not need to be
specified a priori. Empirical studies have been carried out to compare our work
with many constrained clustering algorithms from the literature on both a
variety of data sets and under a variety of conditions such as using noisy side

the electrons escape the galactic disk rapidly. At energies ~1 TEV the

invasive species through a model given by the diffusive logistic equation with
a free boundary. When the environment is homogeneous and favourable, this model
was first studied in Du and Lin \cite{DL}, where a spreading-vanishing
dichotomy was established for the long-time dynamics of the species, and when
spreading happens, it was shown that the species invades the new territory at
some uniquely determined asymptotic speed $c_0>0$. Here we consider the
situation that part of such an environment becomes unfavourable, and the
unfavourable range of the environment moves into the favourable part with speed
$c>0$. We prove that when $c\geq c_0$, the species always dies out in the
long-run, but when $0<c<c_0$, the long-time behavior of the species is
determined by a trichotomy described by
  (a) {\it vanishing}, (b) {\it borderline spreading}, or (c) {\it spreading}.
If the initial population is writen in the form $u_0(x)=\sigma \phi(x)$ with
$\phi$ fixed and $\sigma>0$ a parameter, then there exists $\sigma_0>0$ such
that vanishing happens when $\sigma\in (0,\sigma_0)$, borderline spreading
happens when $\sigma=\sigma_0$, and spreading happens when $\sigma>\sigma_0$.

\alpha/(4\pi\sin\theta_W^2))$ when the energy scale $Q$ enters the TeV regime.
Thus, the inclusion of EW corrections in LHC predictions is important for the
search of possible signals of new physics in tails of kinematic distributions.
EW corrections should also be taken into account in virtue of their comparable
size ($\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$) to that of higher order QCD corrections
($\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$). We calculated the next-to-leading-order (NLO) weak
corrections to the neutral-current (NC) Drell-Yan process, top-quark pair
production and di-jet producion, and implemented them in the Monte-Carlo

Sudakov approximation valid at high energies. The latter is often used for a
fast evaluation of weak effects, and having the exact result available as well

approximation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of linear elliptic problems
have been given in a several recent papers. A key step in establishing such
results for multiple and clustered eigenvalues was provided by Dai et. al.
(2014), who proved convergence and optimality of AFEM for eigenvalues of
multiplicity greater than one. There it was shown that a theoretical
(non-computable) error estimator for which standard convergence proofs apply is
equivalent to a standard computable estimator on sufficiently fine grids.
Gallistl (2015) used a similar tool in order to prove that a standard adaptive
FEM for controlling eigenvalue clusters for the Laplacian using continuous
piecewise linear finite element spaces converges with optimal rate. When
considering either higher-order finite element spaces or non-constant diffusion
coefficients, however, the arguments of Dai et. al. and Gallistl do not yield
equivalence of the practical and theoretical estimators for clustered
eigenvalues. In this note we provide this missing key step, thus showing that
standard adaptive FEM for clustered eigenvalues employing elements of arbitrary
polynomial degree converge with optimal rate. We additionally establish that a
key user-defined input parameter in the AFEM, the bulk marking parameter, may
be chosen entirely independently of the properties of the target eigenvalue

with $N$ selfish players who observe their types privately and take actions
that are publicly observed. Players' types evolve as conditionally independent
Markov processes, conditioned on their current actions. Their actions and types
jointly determine their instantaneous rewards. In dynamic games with asymmetric
information, a widely used concept of equilibrium is perfect Bayesian
equilibrium (PBE), which consists of a strategy and belief pair that
simultaneously satisfy sequential rationality and belief consistency. In
general, there does not exist a universal algorithm that decouples the
interdependence of strategies and beliefs over time in calculating PBE. In this
paper, for the finite-horizon game with independent types we develop a two-step
backward-forward recursive algorithm that sequentially decomposes the problem
(w.r.t. time) to obtain a subset of PBEs, which we refer to as structured
Bayesian perfect equilibria (SPBE). In such equilibria, a player's strategy
depends on its history only through a common public belief and its current
private type. The backward recursive part of this algorithm defines an
equilibrium generating function. Each period in the backward recursion involves
solving a fixed-point equation on the space of probability simplexes for every
possible belief on types. Using this function, equilibrium strategies and
beliefs are generated through a forward recursion. We then extend this
methodology to the infinite-horizon model, where we propose a time-invariant
single-shot fixed-point equation, which in conjunction with a forward recursive
step, generates the SPBE. Sufficient conditions for the existence of SPBE are
provided. With our proposed method, we find equilibria that exhibit signaling
behavior. This is illustrated with the help of a concrete public goods example.

approaches to integrate the two either restrict the object models, or do not
allow sophisticated schedulability analysis techniques. This study shows how
schedulability analysis can be integrated with UML for Real-Time (UML-RT) to
deal with timing properties in real time control systems. More specifically, we
develop the schedulability and feasibility analysis modeling for the external
messages that may suffer release jitter due to being dispatched by a tick
driven scheduler in real-time control system and we also develop the
scheduliablity modeling for sporadic activities, where messages arrive
sporadically then execute periodically for some bounded time. This method can
be used to cope with timing constraints in realistic and complex real-time
control systems. Using this method, a designer can quickly evaluate the impact
of various implementation decisions on schedulability. In conjunction with
automatic code-generation, we believe that this will greatly streamline the

The ML inspired algorithms are constructed iteratively by estimating which of
the remaining target galaxies will be most difficult for the machine learning
methods to accurately estimate redshifts using the previously observed data.
This is performed by predicting the expected redshift error and redshift offset
(or bias) of all of the remaining target galaxies. We find that the predicted

morphological changes in galaxies. Most studies so far have focused on large
galaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass
function is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because
of their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In
this paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they
experience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the
effects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and
kinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical
simulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging
with a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary
the gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while
we explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We
find that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long
duration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few
to 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high
gas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial
orbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of
the systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even
in the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare
remarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of
irregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers
with dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may
thus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population.

in a sample of galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect by
the South Pole Telescope, utilizing data from various ground- and space-based
facilities. We infer the star formation rate (SFR) for the BCG in each cluster,
based on the UV and IR continuum luminosity, as well as the [O II] emission
line luminosity in cases where spectroscopy is available, finding 7 systems
with SFR > 100 Msun/yr. We find that the BCG SFR exceeds 10 Msun/yr in 31 of 90
(34%) cases at 0.25 < z < 1.25, compared to ~1-5% at z ~ 0 from the literature.
At z > 1, this fraction increases to 92(+6)(-31)%, implying a steady decrease
in the BCG SFR over the past ~9 Gyr. At low-z, we find that the specific star
formation rate in BCGs is declining more slowly with time than for field or
cluster galaxies, most likely due to the replenishing fuel from the cooling ICM
in relaxed, cool core clusters. At z > 0.6, the correlation between cluster
central entropy and BCG star formation - which is well established at z ~ 0 -
is not present. Instead, we find that the most star-forming BCGs at high-z are
found in the cores of dynamically unrelaxed clusters. We investigate the
rest-frame near-UV morphology of a subsample of the most star-forming BCGs
using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, finding complex, highly asymmetric
UV morphologies on scales as large as ~50-60 kpc. The high fraction of
star-forming BCGs hosted in unrelaxed, non-cool core clusters at early times
suggests that the dominant mode of fueling star formation in BCGs may have
recently transitioned from galaxy-galaxy interactions to ICM cooling.

3627 (M 66), observed as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey (SFRS).
Both images achieve an angular resolution of $\lesssim$2\arcsec, allowing us to
map the radio spectral indices and estimate thermal radio fractions at a linear
resolution of $\lesssim$90 pc at the distance of NGC 3627. The thermal fraction
at 33 GHz reaches unity at and around the peaks of each HII region; we
additionally observed the spectral index between 33 and 94.5 GHz to become both
increasingly negative and positive away from the peaks of the HII regions,
indicating an increase of non-thermal extended emission from diffusing
cosmic-ray electrons and the possible presence of cold dust, respectively.
While the ALMA observations were optimized for collecting continuum data, they
also detected line emission from the $J=1\rightarrow0$ transitions of HCN and
HCO$^{+}$. The peaks of dense molecular gas traced by these two spectral lines
are spatially offset from the peaks of the 33 and 94.5 GHz continuum emission
for the case of the extranuclear star-forming regions, indicating that our data
reach an angular resolution at which one can spatially distinguish sites of
recent star formation from the sites of future star formation. Finally, we find
trends of decreasing dense gas fraction and velocity dispersion with increasing
star formation efficiency among the three regions observed, indicating that the
dynamical state of the dense gas, rather than its abundance, plays a more
significant role in the star formation process.

secondary BH migrating within the circumbinary disk. If confirmed by future

constrain the MBH mass, spin, and spin direction by considering both the motion
of a star and the propagation of photons from the star to a distant observer.
Assuming some example stars, we demonstrate that the spin-induced effects on
the projected trajectory and redshift curve of a star depend on both the value
and the direction of the spin. The maximum effects over a full orbit can differ
by a factor upto more than one order of magnitude for cases with significantly
different spin directions. Adopting the Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting
technique, we illustrate that the spin of the GC MBH is likely to be well
constrained by using the motion of S0-2/S2 over a period of ~45yr if it is
close to one and the astrometric and spectroscopic precisions (sigma_p,sigma_Z)
can be as high as (10muas, 1km/s). In the mean time, the distance from the sun
to the GC and the MBH mass can also be constrained to an unprecedented accuracy
(0.01%-0.1%). If there exists a star with semimajor axis significantly smaller

can be constrained with high accuracy over a period of <~10yr for

not varied in the previous calculation, but set to zero. Because we now realize
that the FRDM is inaccurate for some highly deformed shapes occurring in

single-photon sources operating in the telecom bands since they exhibit large
photon antibunching up to room temperature. However, coupling a nanotube to a
photonic structure is highly challenging because of the random location and
emission wavelength in the growth process. Here, we demonstrate the realization
of a widely tunable single-photon source by using a carbon nanotube inserted in
an original repositionable fiber micro-cavity : we fully characterize the
emitter in the free-space and subsequently form the cavity around the nanotube.
This brings an invaluable insight into the emergence of quantum
electrodynamical effects. We observe an efficient funneling of the emission
into the cavity mode with a strong sub-Poissonian statistics together with an
up to 6-fold Purcell enhancement factor. By exploiting the cavity feeding
effect on the phonon wings, we locked the single-photon emission at the cavity

that perturbation theory approximates the full quantum theory at small coupling

the other hand, two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory is a rare (if not the only)
example of a nonabelian (pure) gauge theory whose full quantum theory has a
rigorous construction. Indeed, the theory can be formulated via a lattice
approximation, from which Wilson loop expecation values in the continuum limit
can be described in terms of heat kernels on the gauge group. It is therefore
fundamental to investigate how the exact answer for 2D Yang-Mills compares with
that of the continuum perturbative approach, which a priori are unrelated. In
this paper, we provide a mathematically rigorous formulation of the
perturbative quantization of 2D Yang-Mills, and we consider perturbative Wilson
loop expectation values on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $S^2$ in Coulomb gauge,
holomorphic gauge, and axial gauge (on $\mathbb{R}^2$). We show the following
equivalences and nonequivalences between these gauges: (i) Coulomb and
holomorphic gauge are equivalent and are independent of the choice of
gauge-fixing metric; (ii) both are inequivalent with axial-gauge. Additionally,
we show that the asymptotics of exact lattice Wilson loop expectations on $S^2$
agree with perturbatively computed expectations in holomorphic gauge for simple
closed curves to all orders. However, as a consequence of (ii), this result is
necessarily false on $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our work therefore presents fundamental
progress in the analysis of how continuum perturbation theory succeeds or fails

non-linear scale. Consequently, the UV dependence found in explicit
computations within standard perturbation theory stems mostly from
counter-term(s). We confront a simplified version of our non-perturbative

infer the relevance of the leading order EFT coefficient(s) using small volume

allowed in different cells, but not within one cell. As the proposed
optimization problem is inherently non-convex and NP-hard, by applying the
successive convex approximation (SCA) and complementary geometric programming

computational complexity to solve the proposed problem. For a given

for an obtained user-association, Step 2 find the optimum power-allocation.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed iterative algorithm
outperforms the traditional approach in which each user is assigned to the BS

and power allocation is obtained for the assigned users of each cell.
Especially, for the cell-edge users, simulation results reveal a coverage
improvement up to 57% and 71% for uniform and non-uniform users distribution,
respectively leading to more reliable transmission and higher spectrum

for wildlife conservation. However, frequent occurrences of human-wildlife
conflict at the edges of these parks can undermine their conservation goals.
Many African protected areas have experienced concurrent declines of apex
predators alongside increases in both baboon abundance and the density of
humans living near the park boundary. Baboons then take excursions outside of
the park to raid crops for food, conflicting with the human population. We
model the interactions of mesopredators (baboons), apex predators and shared
prey in the park to analyze how four components affect the proportion of time
that mesopredators choose to crop-raid: 1) the presence of apex predators; 2)
nutritional quality of the crops; 3) mesopredator ""shyness"" about leaving the

apex predators in the park is the most effective method for controlling
mesopredator abundance, and hence significantly reduces their impact on crops.
Human hunting of mesopredators is less effective as it only occurs during
crop-raiding excursions. Furthermore, making crops less attractive, for
instance by planting crops further from the park boundary or farming less
nutritional crops, can reduce the amount of time mesopredators crop-raid.

far the largest source of uncertainty. In this work we develop an open-box,
physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in
RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds
stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for
empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability,
smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to
assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework,
and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other
Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over
periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse
observations, the posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly
better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At
most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model

effect is determined by the strength of the applied field relative to the array
coercivity. Specifically, when the applied field strength is almost exactly
equal to the array coercivity, several training cycles are required before the
array achieves a nearly completely repeatable microstate, whereas when the
applied field strength is stronger or weaker than the array coercivity, a
repeatable microstate is achieved after the first minor loop. We show through
experiment and simulation that this memory exhibited by artificial spin ice is
due to a ratchet effect on interacting, magnetically-charged defects in the

reversed moments that forms during magnetization reversal.

two nights of data from a single location --- far too little for an orbit ---
by exploiting the angular reflex motion of the asteroids due to Earth's axial
rotation. We refer to this as the rotational reflex velocity method. While the
concept is simple and well-known, it has not been previously exploited for
surveys of main-belt asteroids. We offer a mathematical development, estimates
of the errors of the approximation, and a demonstration using a sample of 197
asteroids observed for two nights with a small, 0.9-meter telescope. This
demonstration used digital tracking to enhance detection sensitivity for faint
asteroids, but our distance determination works with any detection method.
Forty-eight asteroids in our sample had known orbits prior to our observations,
and for these we demonstrate a mean fractional error of only 1.6% between the
distances we calculate and those given in ephemerides from the Minor Planet
Center. In contrast to our two-night results, distance determination by fitting
approximate orbits requires observations spanning 7--10 nights. Once an
asteroid's distance is known, its absolute magnitude and size (given a
statistically-estimated albedo) may immediately be calculated. Our method will
therefore greatly enhance the efficiency with which 4-meter and larger
telescopes can probe the size distribution of small (e.g. 100 meter) main belt
asteroids. This distribution remains poorly known, yet encodes information
about the collisional evolution of the asteroid belt --- and hence the history

some $N$-length input vector in the presence of noise, where the $N$-point
Walsh spectrum is $K$-sparse with $K = {O}(N^{\delta})$ scaling sub-linearly in
the input dimension $N$ for some $0<\delta<1$. Over the past decade, there has
been a resurgence in research related to the computation of Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) for some length-$N$ input signal that has a $K$-sparse Fourier
spectrum. In particular, through a sparse-graph code design, our earlier work
on the Fast Fourier Aliasing-based Sparse Transform (FFAST) algorithm computes
the $K$-sparse DFT in time ${O}(K\log K)$ by taking ${O}(K)$ noiseless samples.
Inspired by the coding-theoretic design framework, Scheibler et al. proposed
the Sparse Fast Hadamard Transform (SparseFHT) algorithm that elegantly
computes the $K$-sparse WHT in the absence of noise using ${O}(K\log N)$
samples in time ${O}(K\log^2 N)$. However, the SparseFHT algorithm explicitly
exploits the noiseless nature of the problem, and is not equipped to deal with
scenarios where the observations are corrupted by noise. Therefore, a question
of critical interest is whether this coding-theoretic framework can be made
robust to noise. Further, if the answer is yes, what is the extra price that
needs to be paid for being robust to noise? In this paper, we show, quite
interestingly, that there is {\it no extra price} that needs to be paid for
being robust to noise other than a constant factor. In other words, we can
maintain the same sample complexity ${O}(K\log N)$ and the computational

system, are found to be intimately correlated in many systems, and the
correlation is often strongly non-linear. We explore the origin of this complex
dependence by studying diffusion of a point Brownian particle on a model
potential energy surface characterized by ruggedness. If we assume that the
ruggedness has a Gaussian distribution then for this model, one can obtain the
excess entropy exactly for any dimension. By using the expression for the mean
first passage time (MFPT), we present a statistical mechanical derivation of
the well-known and well-tested scaling relation proposed by Rosenfeld between
diffusion and excess entropy. In anticipation that Rosenfeld diffusion-entropy
scaling (RDES) relation may continue to be valid in higher dimensions (where
the mean first passage time approach is not available), we carry out an
effective medium approximation (EMA) based analysis of the effective transition
rate, and hence of the effective diffusion coefficient. We show that the EMA
expression can be used to derive the RDES scaling relation for any dimension
higher than unity. However, RDES is shown to break down in the presence of
spatial correlation among the energy landscape values.

shift of the CMB anisotropy spectrum as a probe of new physics. The phase shift
is particularly interesting because its physical origin is strongly constrained
by the analytic properties of the Green's function of the gravitational

propagate faster than the speed of fluctuations in the photon-baryon plasma.
This possibility is realized by free-streaming relativistic particles, such as
neutrinos or other forms of dark radiation. Alternatively, a phase shift can
arise from isocurvature fluctuations. We present simple models to illustrate

We show that tame, pet, and domestic games turn into miserable games by ""slight

together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various formal systems

traditionally been on the comparison between programming concepts (such as
concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming) and
between mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on the basis of
their relative expressive power. The EXPRESS workshop series has run
successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus has become broadly
construed. The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future
investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the
specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the
concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and
practice of SOS. Since 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities have organized an
annual combined EXPRESS/SOS workshop on the expressiveness of mathematical

in the bilinear current formalism, using two independent approaches. The first
method used is that attributed to Belinfante: starting from the spinor form of
the action, the well-known canonical stress-energy tensor is augmented, by
extending the Noether symmetry current to include contributions from the
Lorentz group, to a manifestly symmetric form. This form admits a transcription
to bilinear current form. The second method used is the variational derivation
based on the covariant coupling to general relativity. The starting point here
at the outset is the transcription of the action using, as independent field
variables, both the bilinear currents, together with a gauge invariant vector
field (a proxy for the electromagnetic vector potential). A central feature of
the two constructions is that they both involve the mapping of the Dirac
contribution to the stress-energy from the spinor fields to the equivalent set
of bilinear tensor currents, through the use of appropriate Fierz identities.
Although this mapping is done at quite different stages, nonetheless we find
that the two forms of the bilinear stress-energy tensor agree. Finally, as an
application, we consider the reduction of the obtained stress-energy tensor in
bilinear form, under the assumption of spherical symmetry.

problems in Cloud data centers is to take the allocation and migration of
reconfigurable virtual machines (VMs) as well as the integrated features of
hosting physical machines (PMs) into consideration. In the reservation model,
the workload of data centers has fixed process interval characteristics. In
general, load-balance scheduling is NP-hard problem as proved in many open
literatures. Traditionally, for offline load balance without migration, one of
the best approaches is LPT (Longest Process Time first), which is well known to
have approximation ratio 4/3. With virtualization, reactive (post) migration of
VMs after allocation is one popular way for load balance and traffic
consolidation. However, reactive migration has difficulty to reach predefined
load balance objectives, and may cause interruption and instability of service
and other associated costs. In view of this, we propose a new paradigm, called
Prepartition, it proactively sets process-time bound for each request on each
PM and prepares in advance to migrate VMs to achieve the predefined balance
goal. Prepartition can reduce process time by preparing VM migration in advance
and therefore reduce instability and achieve better load balance as desired. We
also apply the Prepartition to online (PrepartitionOn) load balance and compare
it with existing online scheduling algorithms. Both theoretical and
experimental results are provided.

massless 4 component fermions, it acquires an interacting conformal phase,
which in $d<4$ describes the long distance behavior of the model. The conformal
phase can be studied using large $N_f$ methods. Generalizing the $d=3$

of $d$, ignoring the terms of order $1/N_f$ and higher. For finite $N_f$,
following arXiv:1409.1937 and arXiv:1507.01960, we develop the $4-\epsilon$

obtain accurate predictions. In many applications, forecast errors exhibit
heavy tail behaviors for various reasons. Unfortunately, to our knowledge,
little has been done to deal with forecast combination for such situations. The
familiar forecast combination methods such as simple average, least squares
regression, or those based on variance-covariance of the forecasts, may perform
very poorly. In this paper, we propose two nonparametric forecast combination
methods to address the problem. One is specially proposed for the situations
that the forecast errors are strongly believed to have heavy tails that can be
modeled by a scaled Student's t-distribution; the other is designed for
relatively more general situations when there is a lack of strong or consistent
evidence on the tail behaviors of the forecast errors due to shortage of data
and/or evolving data generating process. Adaptive risk bounds of both methods
are developed. Simulations and a real example show superior performance of the
new methods.

the parameter $\alpha_{\rm H}$ characterizing the deviation from Horndeski
theories approaches a non-zero constant at the center of a spherically
symmetric body, we find that the conical singularity arises at $r=0$ with the
Ricci scalar given by $R=-2\alpha_{\rm H}/r^2$. This originates from violation
of the geometrical structure of four-dimensional curvature quantities. The
conical singularity can disappear for the models in which the parameter
$\alpha_{\rm H}$ vanishes in the limit that $r \to 0$. We propose explicit
models without the conical singularity by properly designing the classical
Lagrangian in such a way that the main contribution to $\alpha_{\rm H}$ comes
from the field derivative $\phi'(r)$ around $r=0$. We show that the extension
of covariant Galileons with a diatonic coupling allows for the recovery of
general relativistic behavior inside a so-called Vainshtein radius. In this
case, both the propagation of a fifth force and the deviation from Horndeski

nowadays known by scientists, occurred because of the high solar activity that
had visible consequences on Earth, in particular reports of outstanding aurorae
activity that amazed thousands of people in the western hemisphere during the
dawn of September 2. The geomagnetic storm, generated by the solar-terrestrial
event, had such a magnitude that the auroral oval expanded towards the equator,
allowing low latitudes, like Panama's 9$^\circ$ N, to catch a sight of the
aurorae. An expedition was carried out to review several historical reports and
books from the northern cities of Colombia, allowing the identification of a
narrative from Monter\'ia, Colombia (8$^\circ$ 45' N), that describes phenomena
resembling those of an aurorae borealis, such as fire-like lights, blazing and
dazzling glares, and the appearance of an immense S-like shape in the sky. The
very low latitude of the geomagnetic north pole in 1859, the lowest value in
over half a millennia, is proposed to have allowed the observations of auroral
events at locations closer to the equator, and supports the historical
description found in Colombia. The finding of such chronicle represents one of
the most complete descriptions of low-latitude sightings of aurorae caused by
the Carrington Event.

be securely shared among multiple VMs and the host. Compared to the best-known

device passthrough however, we do not require SR-IOV or IOMMU support, and

standard algorithms for generation of the nonce as specified by NIST, as well

Furthermore, the user can select the nonce arbitrarily, which leads to a

the security of the DSA algorithm by proposing an efficient nonce-generation

in the Tweedie GLM, which can be too rigid for many applications. As a better
alternative, we propose a gradient tree-boosting algorithm and apply it to
Tweedie compound Poisson models for pure premiums. We use a profile likelihood
approach to estimate the index and dispersion parameters. Our method is capable
of fitting a flexible nonlinear Tweedie model and capturing complex
interactions among predictors. A simulation study confirms the excellent
prediction performance of our method. As an application, we apply our method to
an auto insurance claim data and show that the new method is superior to the
existing methods in the sense that it generates more accurate premium
predictions, thus helping solve the adverse selection issue. We have
implemented our method in a user-friendly R package that also includes a nice
visualization tool for interpreting the fitted model.

found. At the transition, the spin and charge gap of the system close while the
single-particle excitations remain gapped, which means that this transition has

quantities needed for Cherenkov image analysis. The calibration is based on an
online feedback system to stabilize the gain of the SiPMs, as well as dedicated
events (dark count, pedestal, and light flasher events) to be taken during the
normal operation of the prototype.

recorded X-ray and very high energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray fluxes are
the highest ever measured from this object. At the peak of the activity, it was
monitored by the hard X-ray focusing telescope {\it Nuclear Spectroscopic

work, we present a detailed variability analysis of {\it NuSTAR} and {\it
Swift}-XRT observations of Mrk 421 during this flaring episode. We obtained the
shortest flux doubling time of 14.01$\pm$5.03 minutes, which is the shortest
hard X-ray (3$-$79 keV) variability ever recorded from Mrk 421 and is on the
order of the light crossing time of the black hole's event horizon. A pattern
of extremely fast variability events superposed on slowly varying flares is
found in most of the {\it NuSTAR} observations. We suggest that these peculiar
variability patterns may be explained by magnetic energy dissipation and
reconnection in a fast moving compact emission region within the jet. Based on
the fast variability, we derive a lower limit on the magnetic field strength of
$B \ge 0.73 \delta_1^{-2/3} \, \nu_{19}^{1/3}$~G, where $\delta_1$ is the

requires advanced data processing methods to disentangle potential planetary
signals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among them, angular differential
imaging (ADI) permits potential planetary signals with a known rotation rate to
be separated from instrumental speckles that are either statics or slowly
variable. The method presented in this paper, called ANDROMEDA for ANgular
Differential OptiMal Exoplanet Detection Algorithm is based on a maximum
likelihood approach to ADI and is used to estimate the position and the flux of
any point source present in the field of view. Aims. In order to optimize and
experimentally validate this previously proposed method, we applied ANDROMEDA
to real VLT/NaCo data. In addition to its pure detection capability, we
investigated the possibility of defining simple and efficient criteria for
automatic point source extraction able to support the processing of large
surveys. Methods. To assess the performance of the method, we applied ANDROMEDA
on VLT/NaCo data of TYC-8979-1683-1 which is surrounded by numerous bright
stars and on which we added synthetic planets of known position and flux in the
field. In order to accommodate the real data properties, it was necessary to
develop additional pre-processing and post-processing steps to the initially
proposed algorithm. We then investigated its skill in the challenging case of a
well-known target, $\beta$ Pictoris, whose companion is close to the detection
limit and we compared our results to those obtained by another method based on
principal component analysis (PCA). Results. Application on VLT/NaCo data
demonstrates the ability of ANDROMEDA to automatically detect and characterize
point sources present in the image field. We end up with a robust method
bringing consistent results with a sensitivity similar to the recently
published algorithms, with only two parameters to be fine tuned. Moreover, the
companion flux estimates are not biased by the algorithm parameters and do not
require a posteriori corrections. Conclusions. ANDROMEDA is an attractive
alternative to current standard image processing methods that can be readily
applied to on-sky data.

offers an opportunity to evaluate the thermal structure and flows in flaring

and kinetic energies. Our aim is to model large-scale (50-10000km) velocity
distributions in order to interpret non-thermal broadening of different
spectral EUV lines. The developed models allow us to understand the origin of
the observed spectral line shifts and broadening, and link these features to
particular physical effects in flaring atmospheres. We use ideal MHD to derive
twisted magnetic fluxtube configurations in a stratified atmosphere. The
evolution of these fluxtubes is followed using resistive MHD, with anomalous
resistivity depending on the local density and temperature. The model also
takes into account the thermal conduction and radiative losses. The model
allows us to evaluate average velocities and velocity dispersions, which would
be interpreted as `non-thermal' velocities in observations, at different
temperatures for different parts of the models. Our models show qualitative and
quantitative agreement with observations. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity
dispersions demonstrate substantial correlation with the temperature,
increasing from about 20-30 km/s around 1 MK to about 200-400 km/s near 10-20
MK. The average LOS velocities also correlate with velocity dispersions,
although they demonstrate a very strong scattering, compared to observations.
We also note that near foot-points the velocity dispersions across the magnetic
field are systematically lower than those along the field. We conclude, that
the correlation between the flow velocities, velocity dispersions and
temperatures are likely to indicate that the same heating mechanism is
responsible for heating the plasma, its turbulisation and
expansion/evaporation.

energy range of the Small Size Telescopes (SSTs) extends from 1 TeV to 300 TeV.
Among them, the Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT), a telescope based on a
Schwarzschild-Couder dual-mirror optical design, is one of the prototypes under
construction proposed for the SST sub-array of CTA. This contribution focuses
on the mechanical structure of GCT. It reports on last progress on the
mechanical design and discusses this in the context of CTA specifications.
Recent advances in the assembly and installation of the opto-mechanical
prototype of GCT on the French site of the Paris Observatory are also
described.

partners matching games, defined by a graph $G=(N,E)$, with an integer vertex
capacity function $b$ and an edge weighting $w$. The set $N$ consists of a
number of players that are to form a set $M\subseteq E$ of 2-player coalitions
$ij$ with value $w(ij)$, such that each player $i$ is in at most $b(i)$
coalitions. A payoff vector is a mapping $p: N \times N \rightarrow {\mathbb
R}$ with $p(i,j)+p(j,i)=w(ij)$ if $ij\in M$ and $p(i,j)=p(j,i)=0$ if $ij\notin

E\setminus M$ blocks a solution $(M,p)$ if $i,j$ can form, possibly only after
withdrawing from one of their existing 2-player coalitions, a new 2-player
coalition in which they are mutually better off. A solution is stable if it has
no blocking pairs.
  We give a polynomial-time algorithm that either finds that a given multiple
partners matching game has no stable solution, or obtains a stable solution for
it. We characterize the set of stable solutions of a multiple partners matching
game in two different ways and show how this leads to simple proofs for a
number of known results of Sotomayor (1992,1999,2007) for multiple partners
ssignment games and to generalizations of some of these results to multiple
partners matching games. We also perform a study on the core of the

particular we show that the standard relation between the existence of a stable
solution and the non-emptiness of the core, which holds in the other models

that the problem of deciding if an allocation belongs to the core jumps from

Differences in analytical forms of the currents and resulting distributions

three-dimensional histograms spanned over all distinct squared invariant masses

probability on the space of all the possible continuous histories of a set of
quantities to be considered as a kind of coarse grained approximation to some
ordinary quantum observables commuting or not. The main aim was the
introduction of a classical level in the context of Quantum Mechanics, treating
formally a set of basic quantities {\it to be considered as beables} in the

such assumption was a permanent modification of the Liouville-von Neumann

had considered. Difficulties were even encountered for a relativistic extension

formalism which seems to overcome both difficulties. First I study the simple
models of an harmonic oscillator and a free scalar field in which a coarse
grain position and a coarse grained field respectively are treated as beables.

tailoring specific periods of free and driven evolution of a quantum system.
Unwanted environmental noise, which may in principle be distinct during these

While there has been significant progress characterizing noise processes during
free evolution, the corresponding driven-evolution case is more challenging as
the noise being probed is also extant during the characterization protocol.
Here we demonstrate the noise spectroscopy (0.1 - 200 MHz) of a superconducting
flux qubit during driven evolution by using a robust spin-locking pulse
sequence to measure relaxation (T1rho) in the rotating frame. In the case of
flux noise, we resolve spectral features due to coherent fluctuators, and
further identify a signature of the 1MHz defect in a time-domain spin-echo

modeling, where the number of mixture components grows with the number of data
items. The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), is an extension of DP for
grouped data, often used for non-parametric topic modeling, where each group is
a mixture over shared mixture densities. The Nested Dirichlet Process (nDP), on
the other hand, is an extension of the DP for learning group level
distributions from data, simultaneously clustering the groups. It allows group
level distributions to be shared across groups in a non-parametric setting,
leading to a non-parametric mixture of mixtures. The nCRF extends the nDP for
multilevel non-parametric mixture modeling, enabling modeling topic
hierarchies. However, the nDP and nCRF do not allow sharing of distributions as
required in many applications, motivating the need for multi-level
non-parametric admixture modeling. We address this gap by proposing multi-level
nested HDPs (nHDP) where the base distribution of the HDP is itself a HDP at
each level thereby leading to admixtures of admixtures at each level. Because
of couplings between various HDP levels, scaling up is naturally a challenge
during inference. We propose a multi-level nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise
(nCRF) representation for the nested HDP, with which we outline an inference
algorithm based on Gibbs Sampling. We evaluate our model with the two level
nHDP for non-parametric entity topic modeling where an inner HDP creates a
countably infinite set of topic mixtures and associates them with author
entities, while an outer HDP associates documents with these author entities.
In our experiments on two real world research corpora, the nHDP is able to
generalize significantly better than existing models and detect missing author
entities with a reasonable level of accuracy.

Markov processes into the morphisms of a dagger compact category. We show that
the behavior of a detailed balanced open Markov process is determined by a
principle of minimum dissipation, closely related to Prigogine's principle of
minimum entropy production. Using this fact, we set up a functor mapping open
detailed balanced Markov processes to open circuits made of linear resistors.
We also describe how to ""black box"" an open Markov process, obtaining the
linear relation between input and output data that holds in any steady state,
including nonequilibrium steady states with a nonzero flow of probability
through the system. We prove that black boxing gives a symmetric monoidal
dagger functor sending open detailed balanced Markov processes to Lagrangian
relations between symplectic vector spaces. This allows us to compute the
steady state behavior of an open detailed balanced Markov process from the
behaviors of smaller pieces from which it is built. We relate this black box

  In this paper, we extend the concept of a priori dimension reduction to
non-stationary inverse problems, in which the goal is to sequentially infer the
state of a dynamical system. Our approach proceeds in an offline-online
fashion. We first identify a low-dimensional subspace in the state space before
solving the inverse problem (the offline phase), using either the method of
""snapshots"" or regularized covariance estimation. Then this subspace is used to
reduce the computational complexity of various filtering algorithms - including
the Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, and ensemble Kalman filter - within
a novel subspace-constrained Bayesian prediction-and-update procedure (the
online phase). We demonstrate the performance of our new dimension reduction
approach on various numerical examples. In some test cases, our approach
reduces the dimensionality of the original problem by orders of magnitude and
yields up to two orders of magnitude in computational savings.

numbers $1,\ldots,k$. A function from the vertex set of one $k$-edge-colored
graph to another is a homomorphism if the endpoints of any edge are mapped to
two different vertices connected by an edge of the same color. Given a class
$\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, a $k$-edge-colored graph $\mathbb{H}$ (not necessarily
with the underlying graph in $\mathcal{F}$) is $k$-universal for $\mathcal{F}$
when any $k$-edge-colored graph with the underlying graph in $\mathcal{F}$
admits a homomorphism to $\mathbb{H}$. We characterize graph classes that admit
$k$-universal graphs. For such classes, we establish asymptotically almost
tight bounds on the size of the smallest universal graph.
  For a nonempty graph $G$, the density of $G$ is the maximum ratio of the
number of edges to the number of vertices ranging over all nonempty subgraphs
of $G$. For a nonempty class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, $D(\mathcal{F})$ denotes
the density of $\mathcal{F}$, that is the supremum of densities of graphs in
$\mathcal{F}$.
  The main results are the following. The class $\mathcal{F}$ admits
$k$-universal graphs for $k\geq2$ if and only if there is an absolute constant
that bounds the acyclic chromatic number of any graph in $\mathcal{F}$. For any
such class, there exists a constant $c$, such that for any $k \geq 2$, the size
of the smallest $k$-universal graph is between $k^{D(\mathcal{F})}$ and
$ck^{\lceil D(\mathcal{F})\rceil}$.
  A connection between the acyclic coloring and the existence of universal
graphs was first observed by Alon and Marshall (Journal of Algebraic
Combinatorics, 8(1):5-13, 1998). One of their results is that for planar
graphs, the size of the smallest $k$-universal graph is between $k^3+3$ and
$5k^4$. Our results yield that there exists a constant $c$ such that for all
$k$, this size is bounded from above by $ck^3$.

the theory of general relativity (GR). In the context of GR, the deviation of
nearby geodesics can be described by the Jacobi equation that is a result of
linearizing the geodesic equation around a known reference geodesic with
respect to the deviation vector and the relative velocity. We review the

the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution and circular
reference geodesics to find solutions by projecting the Jacobi equation on a
parallel propagated tetrad as done by Fuchs. Using his results, we construct
solutions of the Jacobi equation for different physical initial scenarios

with their precise impact on satellite orbit deviation. We further consider the
Newtonian analog and construct the full solution, that exhibits a similar

In broadcasting,one node of a network has a message that must be learned by all
other nodes. In gossiping, every node has a (possibly different) message, and
all messages must be learned by all nodes. We study these well-researched tasks
in a very weak communication model, called the {\em beeping model}.
Communication proceeds in synchronous rounds. In each round, a node can either
listen, i.e., stay silent, or beep, i.e., emit a signal. A node hears a beep in
a round, if it listens in this round and if one or more adjacent nodes beep in
this round. All nodes have different labels from the set $\{0,\dots , L-1\}$.
  Our aim is to provide fast deterministic algorithms for broadcasting and
gossiping in the beeping model. Let $N$ be an upper bound on the size of the
network and $D$ its diameter. Let $m$ be the size of the message in
broadcasting, and $M$ an upper bound on the size of all input messages in

various degrees of freedom have successfully been generated, representing
compelling evidence to support the completeness of quantum theory. Today, the
generation of an EPR-entangled state of motion of two massive objects of up to
the kilogram-scale seems feasible with state-of-the-art technology. Recently,
the generation and verification of EPR-entangled mirror motion in

testing quantum theory in the regime of macroscopic objects, and to make
available nonclassical probe systems for future tests of modified quantum
theories that include (non-relativistic) gravity. The work presented here
builds on these earlier results and proposes a specific Michelson
interferometer that includes two high-quality laser mirrors of about 0.1 kg
mass each. The mirrors are individually suspended as pendula and located close
to each other, and cooled to about 4 K. The physical concepts for the
generation of the EPR-entangled centre of mass motion of these two mirrors are
described. Apart from a test of quantum mechanics in the macroscopic world, the

importance of anisotropic electron-phonon interaction has been recently
highlighted from both theoretical and experimental point of view, and explains

afunction of temperature and pressure, with state of the art ab initio
calculations. By explicitly taking into account anharmonic effects, we obtain
an accurate, quantitative, description of the (P,T) dependence of the phonon
spectrum, accounting for the rapid destruction of the CDW under pressure by
zero mode vibrations - or quantum fluctuations - of the lattice. The low-energy
longitudinal acoustic mode that drives the CDW transition barely contributes to
superconductivity, explaining the insensitivity of the superconducting critical

cells' moves into prediction model is the key to reduce the tracking errors:
cell-switching and coalescence of tracked positions. We model target cells'
correlated moves as a Markov random field and we also derive a fast computation
algorithm, which we call spatial particle filter. With the live-imaging data of

order in which links occur in real-world temporal networks affects causality
structures and thus the evolution of dynamical processes, and ii) higher-order
aggregate representations of temporal networks can be used to analytically
study the effect of these order correlations on dynamical processes. In this
article we analyze the effect of order correlations on path-based centrality
measures in real-world temporal networks. Analyzing temporal equivalents of
betweenness, closeness and reach centrality in six empirical temporal networks,
we first show that an analysis of the commonly used static, time-aggregated
representation can give misleading results about the actual importance of
nodes. We further study higher-order time-aggregated networks, a recently
proposed generalization of the commonly applied static, time-aggregated
representation of temporal networks. Here, we particularly define path-based
centrality measures based on second-order aggregate networks, empirically
validating that node centralities calculated in this way better capture the
true temporal centralities of nodes than node centralities calculated based on
the commonly used static (first-order) representation. Apart from providing a
simple and practical method for the approximation of path-based centralities in
temporal networks, our results highlight interesting perspectives for the use
of higher-order aggregate networks in the analysis of time-stamped network

classical and quantum methods to experimentally explore the properties of an
interacting quantum gas by creating experimental realizations of continuous
matrix product states - a class of states which has proven extremely powerful
as a variational ansatz for numerical simulations. By systematically preparing
and probing these states using a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system
we experimentally determine a good approximation to the ground-state wave
function of the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian, which describes an interacting Bose
gas in one dimension. Since the simulated Hamiltonian is encoded in the
measurement observable rather than the controlled quantum system, this approach
has the potential to apply to exotic models involving multicomponent
interacting fields. Our findings also hint at the possibility of experimentally
exploring general properties of matrix product states and entanglement theory.
The scheme presented here is applicable to a broad range of systems exploiting

field of view. Two of them, the ASTRI (Astrophysics con Specchi a Tecnologia
Replicante Italiana) and the GCT (Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope) telescopes,
are based on dual mirror Schwarzschild-Couder optics, with primary mirror
diameters of 4 m. The third, SST-1M, is a Davies-Cotton design with a 4 m

these telescopes is presented. The SST cameras use silicon photomultipliers,
with preamplifier and readout/trigger electronics designed to optimize the

70 telescopes at the CTA southern site. Current plans for the implementation of

worldwide and often results in huge monetary losses sophisticated methods for
drought monitoring and decision making are needed. Several different approaches
to quantify drought have been developed during past decades. However, most of
these drought indices suffer from different shortcomings and do not account for
the multiple driving factors which promote drought conditions and their
inter-dependencies. We provide a novel methodology for the calculation of
(multivariate) drought indices, which combines the advantages of existing
approaches and omits their disadvantages. Moreover, our approach benefits from
the flexibility of vine copulas in modeling multivariate non-Gaussian
inter-variable dependence structures. A three-variate data example is used in
order to investigate drought conditions in Europe and to illustrate and reason
the different modeling steps. The data analysis shows the appropriateness of
the described methodology. Comparison to well-established drought indices shows
the benefits of our multivariate approach. The validity of the new methodology
is verified by comparing the spatial extent of historic drought events based on
different drought indices. Further, we show that the assumption of non-Gaussian
dependence structures is well-grounded in this real-world application.

results by performing first principles calculations, which indicate the
existence of electron doping at the (100) surface. This stabilizes Bi ions in a
3+ state, shortens Bi-O bonds and reduces the electronic band gap, increasing
the surface conductivity. Our results emphasize the importance of surface

estimate its timescale. In the model, regolith convection is driven by the
impact-induced global seismic shaking. The model consists of three steps: (i)
intermittent impact of meteoroids, (ii) impact-induced global vibration
(seismic shaking), and (iii) vibration-induced regolith convection. In order to
assess the feasibility of the resurfacing process driven by regolith
convection, we estimate the resurfacing timescale as a function of the size of
a target asteroid. In the estimate, a set of parameter values is assumed on the
basis of previous works. However, some of them (e.g., seismic quality factor
$Q$, seismic efficiency $\eta$, and seismic frequency $f$) are very uncertain.
Although these parameter values might depend on asteroid size, we employ the
standard values to estimate the representative behavior. To clarify the
parameter dependences, we develop an approximated scaling form for the
resurfacing timescale. According to the estimated result, we find that the
regolith-convection-based resurfacing timescale is shorter than the mean
collisional lifetime in most of the parameter uncertainty ranges. These
parameter ranges are within those reported by previous works for small
asteroids. This means that the regolith convection can be a possible mechanism
for the asteroid resurfacing process.

irregularity and heterogeneity in their time averaged response properties.
Previous studies suggested that these properties are outcome of an intrinsic
chaotic dynamics. Indeed, simplified rate-based large neuronal networks with
random synaptic connections are known to exhibit sharp transition from fixed
point to chaotic dynamics when the synaptic gain is increased. However, the
existence of a similar transition in neuronal circuit models with more
realistic architectures and firing dynamics has not been established.
  In this work we investigate rate based dynamics of neuronal circuits composed
of several subpopulations and random connectivity. Nonzero connections are
either positive-for excitatory neurons, or negative for inhibitory ones, while
single neuron output is strictly positive; in line with known constraints in
many biological systems. Using Dynamic Mean Field Theory, we find the phase
diagram depicting the regimes of stable fixed point, unstable dynamic and
chaotic rate fluctuations. We characterize the properties of systems near the
chaotic transition and show that dilute excitatory-inhibitory architectures
exhibit the same onset to chaos as a network with Gaussian connectivity.
Interestingly, the critical properties near transition depend on the shape of
the single- neuron input-output transfer function near firing threshold.
Finally, we investigate network models with spiking dynamics. When synaptic
time constants are slow relative to the mean inverse firing rates, the network
undergoes a sharp transition from fast spiking fluctuations and static firing
rates to a state with slow chaotic rate fluctuations. When the synaptic time
constants are finite, the transition becomes smooth and obeys scaling
properties, similar to crossover phenomena in statistical mechanics

from statistical isotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) if the
primordial fluctuations are non-Gaussian and extend to superhorizon scales. The
primary motivation is to properly characterize the monopole and dipole
modulations of the primordial power spectrum that are generated by the coupling
between superhorizon and subhorizon perturbations. Unlike previous proposals
for generating the hemispherical power asymmetry, we do not assume that the
power asymmetry results from a single large superhorizon mode. Instead, we
extrapolate the observed power spectrum to superhorizon scales and compute the
power asymmetry that would result from a specific realization of non-Gaussian
perturbations on scales larger than the observable universe. Our study
encompasses many of the scenarios that have been put forward as possible
explanations for the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry. We confirm our analytic
predictions for the probability of a given power asymmetry by comparing them to
numerical realizations of CMB maps. We find that non-local models of
non-Gaussianity and scale-dependent local non-Gaussianity produce
scale-dependent modulations of the power spectrum, thereby potentially
producing both a monopolar and a dipolar power modulation on large scales. We
then provide simple examples of finding the posterior distributions for the
parameters of the bispectrum from the observed monopole and dipole modulations.

2. We prove strong convergence with order $1/2$. This study is aimed at
analysing the use of this scheme either at each level or only at the finest
level of a multilevel Monte Carlo estimator: indeed, the variance of a
multilevel Monte Carlo estimator is related to the strong error between the two
schemes used on the coarse and fine grids at each level. Recently, Giles and
Szpruch proposed a scheme permitting to construct a multilevel Monte Carlo
estimator achieving the optimal complexity $O\left(\epsilon^{-2}\right)$ for
the precision $\epsilon$. In the same spirit, we propose a modified
Ninomiya-Victoir scheme, which may be strongly coupled with order $1$ to the
Giles-Szpruch scheme at the finest level of a multilevel Monte Carlo estimator.
Numerical experiments show that this choice improves the efficiency, since the
order $2$ of weak convergence of the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme permits to reduce
the number of discretization levels.

a set of positive Lebesgue measure, $x$ is recursive. This statement, and the
analogous statement for non-meagerness instead of positive Lebesgue measure,
have been shown to carry over to many models of transfinite computations. Here,
we start exploring another analogue concerning recognizability rather than
computability. We introduce a notion of relativized recognizability and show
that, for Infinite Time Turing Machines (ITTMs), if a real $x$ is recognizable
relative to all elements of a non-meager Borel set $Y$, then $x$ is
recognizable. We also show that a relativized version of this statement holds
for Infinite Time Register Machines (ITRMs). This extends our earlier work
where we obtained the (unrelativized) result for ITRMs. We then introduce a
jump operator for recognizability, examine its set-theoretical content and show
that the recognizable jumps for ITRMs and ITTMs are primitive-recursively
equivalent, even though these two models are otherwise of vastly different
strength. Finally, we introduce degrees of recognizability by considering the
transitive closure of relativized recognizability and connect it with the
recognizable jump operator to obtain a solution to Post's problem for degrees
of recognizability.

Small cycle times termed sudden refrigerators, develop coherence and inner

point of minimum ratio between energy and coherence the cycle changes geometry.
This region of cycle times is characterised by short circuit cycles where heat
is dissipated both to the hot and cold baths. We rationalise the cycle change
of geometry as a result of a half integer quantisation which maximises
coherence. From this point on, increasing or decreasing the cycle time,
eventually leads to refrigeration cycles. The transition point between
refrigerators and short circuit cycles is characterised by a transition from
finite to singular dynamical temperature. Extremely short cycle times reach a

signal from the foregrounds of Galactic and extra-Galactic origins that are
stronger by many orders of magnitude than the former. The smooth frequency
spectrum expected for the foregrounds would nominally contaminate only very
small $k_\parallel$ modes; however the chromatic response of the telescope
antenna pattern at this wavelength to the foreground introduces non-smooth
structure, pervasively contaminating the cosmic signal over the physical scales
of our interest. Such contamination defines a wedged volume in Fourier space
around the transverse modes that is inaccessible for the cosmic signal. In this
paper, we test the effect of this contaminated wedge on the future 21 cm BAO
surveys using Fisher information matrix calculation. We include the signal
improvement due to the BAO reconstruction technique that has been used for
galaxy surveys and test the effect of this wedge on the BAO reconstruction as a
function of signal to noises and incorporate the results in the Fisher matrix
calculation. We find that the wedge effect expected at $z=1-2$ is very
detrimental to the angular diameter distances: the errors on angular diameter
distances increased by 3-4.4 times, while the errors on H(z) increased by a
factor of 1.5-1.6. We conclude that calibration techniques that clean out the

when there is a model-plant mismatch, the set of parameter estimates that

limit with Wilson fermion and investigate dynamical mass generation from
inverse-mass expansion. The dimensionless mass $M$ defined via the effective
potential is employed as the expansion parameter of the bare coupling constant
$\beta$ which is partially renormalized by the subtraction of linear
divergence. We show that $\delta$-expansion of the $1/M$ series of $\beta$ is
compatible with the mass renormalization. After the confirmation of the
continuum scaling of the bare coupling without fermion doubling, we attempt to
estimate dynamical mass in the continuum limit and obtain the results
converging to the exact value for values of Wilson parameter $r\in (0.8,1.0)$.

plasmas is presented and applied to the treatment of temperature relaxation in
multi-component quantum plasmas when the separate components (electrons and
ions) relax to LTE much faster than the mutual equilibration rate. The
underlying theory is based upon the Random Phase Approximation with static
local field corrections (LFCs) to account for short-range correlations between
the particles. A general formula for the electron-ion equilibration rate,
similar to the one given by Daligault and Dimonte, is derived. However a
different approach is advocated for the determination of the LFCs , one that
allows a detailed quantal treatment of the electrons and with allowance for the
possible presence of bound states. The theory presented here accommodates any
number of plasma components and provides a basis for an approximate
self-consistent solution of the general Coulomb many-body problem that
incorporates static short-range correlations into the RPA. This has
implications for improved modelling of the static and low frequency transport
and equation-of-state properties of dense plasma. Limitations of the model are
also discussed.

fully account for the orthorhombicity of the system, and are thus the origin of
any static iron magnetism. Orthorhombicity and static magnetism are not
hindered by superconductivity but limited by dilution effects, in agreement
with 2D (respectively 3D) nearest-neighbor square lattice site percolation when
the rare earth is nonmagnetic (respectively magnetic). The LD-like regions are
not intrinsically supportive of superconductivity, on the contrary of the

requires the quark's constituent mass to fall peculiarly sharply in the IR so
that meson physics is sensitive to RG scales well below the quark's on-shell

the near conformal symmetry which is present above the quark on-shell mass

understanding of fundamental physics. One promising avenue is to modify general
relativity and obtain a new description of the gravitational force. Because
gravitation dominates the other forces mostly on large scales, cosmological
probes provide an ideal testing ground for theories of gravity. In this thesis,
we describe two complementary approaches to the problem of testing gravity
using cosmology.
  In the first part, we discuss the cosmological solutions of massive gravity
and its generalisation to a bimetric theory. These theories describe a graviton
with a small mass, and can potentially explain the late-time acceleration in a
technically-natural way. We describe these self-accelerating solutions and
investigate the cosmological perturbations in depth, beginning with an
investigation of their linear stability, followed by the construction of a
method for solving these perturbations in the quasistatic limit. This allows
the predictions of stable bimetric models to be compared to observations of
structure formation. Next, we discuss prospects for theories in which matter
""doubly couples"" to both metrics, and examine the cosmological expansion
history in both massive gravity and bigravity with a specific double coupling
which is ghost-free at low energies.
  In the second and final part, we study the consequences of Lorentz violation
during inflation. We consider Einstein-aether theory, in which a vector field
spontaneously breaks Lorentz symmetry and couples nonminimally to the metric,
and allow the vector to couple in a general way to a scalar field. Specialising
to inflation, we discuss the slow-roll solutions in background and at the
perturbative level. The system exhibits a severe instability which places
constraints on such a vector-scalar coupling to be at least five orders of
magnitude stronger [...]

a uniformly distributed net charge, because the electromagnetic field tensor in
such a universe must be vanishing everywhere. For a closed universe with a
nonzero net charge, Maxwell's equations always fail regardless of the spacetime
symmetry and the charge distribution. The two paradoxes indicate that Maxwell's
equations need be modified to be applicable to the universe as a whole. We
consider two types of modified Maxwell equations, both can address the
paradoxes. One is the Proca-type equation which contains a photon mass term.
This type of electromagnetic field equations can naturally arise from
spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism in quantum field theory,
where photons acquire a mass by eating massless Goldstone bosons. However,
photons loose their mass when symmetry is restored, and the paradoxes reappear.
The other type of modified Maxwell equations, which are more attractive in our
opinions, contain a term with the electromagnetic potential vector coupled to
the spacetime curvature tensor. This type of electromagnetic field equations do
not introduce a new dimensional parameter and return to Maxwell's equations in
a flat or Ricci-flat spacetime. We show that the curvature-coupled term can
naturally arise from the ambiguity in extending Maxwell's equations from a flat
spacetime to a curved spacetime through the minimal substitution rule. Some
consequences of the modified Maxwell equations are investigated. The results
show that for reasonable parameters the modification does not affect existing
experiments and observations. However, the field equations with a
curvature-coupled term can be testable in astrophysical environments where mass
density is high or the gravity of electromagnetic radiation plays a dominant
role in dynamics, e.g., interior of neutron stars and the early universe.

which is produced by laptop computers. The magnetic field, which is
characterized by extremely low frequencies up to 300 Hz is measured due to its
hazardous effects to the laptop user's health. The experiment consists of
testing 13 different laptop computers in normal operation conditions. The
measuring of the magnetic field is performed in the adjacent neighborhood of
the laptop computers. The measured data are presented and then classified. The
classification is performed by the K-Medians method in order to determine the
critical positions of the laptop. At the end, the measured magnetic field
values are compared with the critical values suggested by different safety
standards. It is shown that some of the laptop computers emit a very strong
magnetic field. Hence, they must be used with extreme caution.

likely to occur next, over historical real-time event streams. Existing
approaches to causal prediction queries have a number of limitations. First,
they exhaustively search over an acyclic causal network to find the most likely
k effect events; however, data from real event streams frequently reflect
cyclic causality. Second, they contain conservative assumptions intended to
exclude all possible non-causal links in the causal network; it leads to the
omission of many less-frequent but important causal links. We overcome these
limitations by proposing a novel event precedence model and a run-time causal
inference mechanism. The event precedence model constructs a first order
absorbing Markov chain incrementally over event streams, where an edge between
two events signifies a temporal precedence relationship between them, which is
a necessary condition for causality. Then, the run-time causal inference
mechanism learns causal relationships dynamically during query processing. This
is done by removing some of the temporal precedence relationships that do not
exhibit causality in the presence of other events in the event precedence
model. This paper presents two query processing algorithms -- one performs
exhaustive search on the model and the other performs a more efficient reduced
search with early termination. Experiments using two real datasets (cascading
blackouts in power systems and web page views) verify the effectiveness of the
probabilistic top-k prediction queries and the efficiency of the algorithms.
Specifically, the reduced search algorithm reduced runtime, relative to
exhaustive search, by 25-80% (depending on the application) with only a small
reduction in accuracy.

in formulating and implementing more targeted transportation policies, as
commuters exhibit different ways of traveling. With the advent of the Automated
Fare Collection system (AFC), probing the travel patterns of commuters has
become less invasive and more accessible. Consequently, numerous transport
studies related to human mobility have shown that these observed patterns allow
one to pair individuals with locations and/or activities at certain times of
the day. However, classifying commuters using their travel signatures is yet to
be thoroughly examined.
  Here, we contribute to the literature by demonstrating a procedure to
characterize passenger types (Adult, Child/Student, and Senior Citizen) based
on their three-month travel patterns taken from a smart fare card system. We
first establish a method to construct distinct commuter matrices, which we
refer to as eigentravel matrices, that capture the characteristic travel
routines of individuals. From the eigentravel matrices, we build classification
models that predict the type of passengers traveling. Among the models
explored, the gradient boosting method (GBM) gives the best prediction accuracy
at 76%, which is 84% better than the minimum model accuracy (41%) required
vis-\`a-vis the proportional chance criterion. In addition, we find that travel
features generated during weekdays have greater predictive power than those on
weekends. This work should not only be useful for transport planners, but for
market researchers as well. With the awareness of which commuter types are
traveling, ads, service announcements, and surveys, among others, can be made
more targeted spatiotemporally. Finally, our framework should be effective in
creating synthetic populations for use in real-world simulations that involve a
metropolitan's public transport system.
