interface under the temperature gradient. The increased temperature gradient
induces a wide single-phase region at two sides of the interface. The uphill
diffusion proceeds through the interface, no matter the diffusion directions

conventional thermocouple heat-engine, in which the active region being heated
is unavoidably also exchanging heat with its cold environment. Heat exchange
between the dot and the thermal reservoirs is treated as a capacitive coupling
to electronic fluctuations in localized levels, modeled as two additional
quantum dots. The resulting multiple-dot setup is described using a master
equation approach. We observe an ""exotic"" power generation, which remains
finite even when the heat absorbed from the thermal reservoirs is zero (in
other words the heat coming from the hot reservoir all escapes into the cold
environment). This effect can be understood in terms of a non-local effect in
which the heat flow from heat source to the cold environment generates power
via a mechanism which we refer to as Coulomb heat drag. It relies on the fact
that there is no relaxation in the quantum dot system, so electrons within it
have a non-thermal energy distribution. More poetically, one can say that we
find a spatial separation of the first-law of thermodynamics (heat to work
conversion) from the second-law of thermodynamics (generation of entropy). We
present circumstances in which this non-thermal system can generate more power
than any conventional macroscopic thermocouple (with local thermalization),
even when the latter works with Carnot efficiency.

shower array of 300 water Cherenkov detectors (WCD's), each with 4
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Because the observatory is sensitive to air
showers produced by cosmic rays and gamma rays, one of the main tasks in the
analysis of gamma-ray sources is gamma/hadron separation for the suppression of
the cosmic-ray background. Currently, HAWC uses a method called compactness for
the separation. This method divides the data into 10 bins that depend on the
number of PMTs in each event, and each bin has its own value cut. In this work
we present a new method which depends continuously on the number of PMTs in the
event instead of binning, and therefore uses a single cut for gamma/hadron
separation. The method uses a Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron net (MLP) fed
with five characteristics of the air shower to create a single output value. We
used simulated cosmic-ray and gamma-ray events to find the optimal cut and then
applied the technique to data from the Crab Nebula. This new method is tuned on
MC and predicts better gamma/hadron separation than the existing one.
Preliminary tests on the Crab data are consistent with such an improvement, but
in future work it needs to be compared with the full implementation of
compactness with selection criteria tuned for each of the data bins.

hydrodynamics from transport models. Hydrodynamics requires that the
energy-momentum tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$ and four-currents $j^{\mu}$ do not deviate
considerably from the equilibrium ideal-fluid form, but the ones constructed
from transport do not necessarily possess this property. In this work we
investigate the space-time picture of $T^{\mu\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium
in Au+Au collisions using a coarse-grained transport approach. The collision
energy is varied in the range $E_{lab} = 5-160A$ GeV. The sensitivity of
$T^{\mu\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium to collision centrality, and other
parameters such as the switching criterion, the amount of statistics used to
construct the initial state, and the smearing parameter $\sigma$ is
investigated. For low statistics deviations of $T^{\mu\nu}$ from equilibrium
are large and dominated by the effect of finite sampling. For large statistics
the pressure anisotropy plays the most significant role, while the off-diagonal
components of $T^{\mu\nu}$ are small in a large volume during the whole
evolution. For all considered energies and centralities the pressure anisotropy
exhibits a similar feature: there is a narrow interval of time, when it rapidly
drops in a considerable volume. This allows us to introduce an ""isotropization
time,"" which is found to decrease with energy and slightly increase with
centrality. The isotropization times are larger than times typically used for
initializing hydrodynamics.

classify different networks. However, it is not clear if such methods provide
consistent, robust and meaningful results when considering hierarchies as a
whole. Part of the problem is the lack of a similarity measure for the
comparison of hierarchical community structures. In this work we give a
contribution by introducing the {\it hierarchical mutual information}, which is
a generalization of the traditional mutual information, and allows to compare
hierarchical partitions and hierarchical community structures. The {\it
normalized} version of the hierarchical mutual information should behave
analogously to the traditional normalized mutual information. Here, the correct
behavior of the hierarchical mutual information is corroborated on an extensive
battery of numerical experiments. The experiments are performed on artificial
hierarchies, and on the hierarchical community structure of artificial and
empirical networks. Furthermore, the experiments illustrate some of the
practical applications of the hierarchical mutual information. Namely, the
comparison of different community detection methods, and the study of the
consistency, robustness and temporal evolution of the hierarchical modular
structure of networks.

comparing GVCs across countries and over time. First, we use the World
Input-Output Database (WIOD) to construct both the upstream and downstream
global value networks, where the nodes are individual sectors in different
countries and the links are the value-added contribution relationships. Second,
we introduce a network-based measure of node similarity to compare the GVCs
between any pair of countries for each sector and each year available in the
WIOD. Our network-based similarity is a better measure for node comparison than
the existing ones because it takes into account all the direct and indirect
relationships between country-sector pairs, is applicable to both directed and
weighted networks with self-loops, and takes into account externally defined
node attributes. As a result, our measure of similarity reveals the most
intensive interactions among the GVCs across countries and over time. From 1995
to 2011, the average similarity between sectors and countries have clear
increasing trends, which are temporarily interrupted by the recent economic
crisis. This measure of the similarity of GVCs provides quantitative answers to
important questions about dependency, sustainability, risk, and competition in

state where a set of variables of a system of coupled oscillators show an
oscillation death (OD) state, while the rest are in an amplitude death (AD)
state under the identical parametric condition. In the second mixed death state
(we refer it as the MNAD state) a nontrivial bistable AD and a monostable AD
state appear simultaneously to different set of variables of a same system. We
find these states in paradigmatic chaotic Lorenz system and Lorenz-like system
under generic coupling schemes. We identify that while the reflection symmetry
breaking is responsible for the MNAD state, the breaking of both the reflection
and translational symmetries result in the MMD state. Using a rigorous
bifurcation analysis we establish the occurrence of the MMD and MNAD states,
and map their transition routes in parameter space. Moreover, we report the

example, given any real sequence {y_i}, we build a divergent series of
non-negative reals psi(n) such that for any y in {y_i}, almost no real number
is inhomogeneously psi-approximable with inhomogeneous parameter y.
Furthermore, given any second sequence {z_i} not intersecting the rational span

Conjecture (1950), we can ensure that almost every real number is
inhomogeneously psi-approximable with any inhomogeneous parameter z in {z_i}.
Next, we prove a positive result that is near optimal in view of the
limitations that our counterexamples impose. This leads to a discussion of
natural analogues of the Duffin--Schaeffer Conjecture and Duffin--Schaeffer
Theorem (1941) in the inhomogeneous setting. As a step toward these, we prove

at density relevant to neutron star properties. At low baryon density, n_B < ~
2n_s (n_s: nuclear saturation density), we utilize purely hadronic equations of
state that are constrained by empirical observations at density n_B ~ n_s and
neutron star radii. At high density, n_B > ~ 5n_s, we use the percolated quark
matter equations of state which must be very stiff to pass the two-solar mass
constraints. The intermediate domain at 2 < n_B/n_s < 5 is described as neither
purely hadronic nor percolated quark matter, and the equations of state are
inferred by interpolating hadronic and percolated quark matter equations of
state. Possible forms of the interpolation are severely restricted by the
condition on the (square of) speed of sound, 0 < c_s^2 < 1. The characteristics
of the 3-window equation of state are compared with those of conventional
hybrid and self-bound quark matters. Using a schematic quark model for the
percolated domain, it is argued that the two-solar mass constraint requires the
model parameters to be as large as their vacuum values, indicating that the
gluon dynamics remains strongly non-perturbative to n_B ~ 10n_s. The hyperon
puzzle is also briefly discussed in light of quark descriptions.

1.3x$10^{44}$erg/s, then decays very slowly at 0.015mag. per day. The measured
ejecta velocity is 13000km/s. The inferred explosion characteristics, such as
the ejecta mass (67-220$M_\odot$), the total radiative and kinetic energy
($10^{51}$ & 2x$10^{53}$erg respectively), is typical of a slow-evolving H-poor
SLSN event. However, the late-time spectrum taken at +251days reveals a Balmer
Halpha emission feature with broad and narrow components, which has never been
detected before among other H-poor SLSNe. The broad component has a velocity
width of ~4500km/s and has a ~300km/s blue-ward shift relative to the narrow
component. We interpret this broad H$\alpha$ emission with luminosity of
$\sim$2$\times10^{41}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ as resulting from the interaction between
the supernova ejecta and a discrete H-rich shell, located at a distance of
$\sim4\times10^{16}$\,cm from the explosion site. This ejecta-CSM interaction
causes the rest-frame r-band LC to brighten at late times. The fact that the
late-time spectra are not completely absorbed by the shock ionized CSM shell
implies that its Thomson scattering optical depth is likely <1, thus setting
upper limits on the CSM mass <30$M_\odot$ and the volume number density
<4x$10^8cm^{-3}$. Of the existing models, a Pulsational Pair Instability
Supernova model can naturally explain the observed 30$M_\odot$ H-shell, ejected
from a progenitor star with an initial mass of (95-150)$M_\odot$ about 40 years
ago. We estimate that at least $\sim$15\%\ of all SLSNe-I may have late-time
Balmer emission lines.

quantities, thus exploring the diagnostic potential of the 133.5 nm lines. We
find that the line core intensity is correlated with the temperature at the
formation height but the correlation is rather weak, especially when the lines
are strong. The line core Doppler shift is a good measure of the line-of-sight
velocity at the formation height. The line width is both dependent on the width
of the absorption profile (thermal and non-thermal width) and an opacity
broadening factor of 1.2-4 due to the optically thick line formation with a
larger broadening for double peak profiles. The 133.5 nm lines can be formed
both higher and lower than the core of the Mg II k line depending on the amount
of plasma in the 14-50 kK temperature range. More plasma in this temperature
range gives a higher 133.5 nm formation height relative to the Mg II k line
core. The synthetic line profiles have been compared with IRIS observations.
The derived parameters from the simulated line profiles cover the parameter
range seen in observations but on average the synthetic profiles are too
narrow. We interpret this discrepancy as a combination of a lack of plasma at
chromospheric temperatures in the simulation box and too small non-thermal
velocities. The large differences in the distribution of properties between the
synthetic profiles and the observed ones show that the 133.5 nm lines are
powerful diagnostics of the upper chromosphere and lower transition region.

real-space and state-space localization are independent concepts in general, we
show that both perspectives may be directly connected through a specific choice
of initial states, namely, maximally localized states (ML-states). We show
numerically that in the noninteracting case the average echo is found to be
monotonically increasing with increasing disorder; these results are in
agreement with an analytical evaluation in the single particle case in which
the echo is found to be inversely proportional to the localization length. We
also show that for interacting systems, the length scale under which
equilibration may occur is upper bounded and such bound is smaller the greater
the average echo of ML-states. When disorder and interactions, both being
localization mechanisms, are simultaneously at play the echo features a
non-monotonic behaviour indicating a non-trivial interplay of the two
processes. This interplay induces delocalization of the dynamics which is
accompanied by delocalization in real-space. This non-monotonic behaviour is
also present in the effective integrability which we show by evaluating the gap
statistics.

the power grid requires performance evaluation with real topologies of power
transmission networks. However, due to security reasons, such topologies and
particularly the locations of the substations and the lines are usually not
publicly available. Therefore, we study the structural properties of the North
American grids and present an algorithm for generating synthetic spatially
embedded networks with similar properties to a given grid. The algorithm uses
the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for density estimation of the node positions
and generates a set of nodes with similar spatial distribution to the nodes in
a given network. Then, it uses two procedures, which are inspired by the
historical evolution of the grids, to connect the nodes. The algorithm has
several tunable parameters that allow generating grids similar to any given
grid. Particularly, we apply it to the Western Interconnection (WI) and to
grids that operate under the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) and the
Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC), and show that it generates
grids with similar structural and spatial properties to these grids. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider the spatial
distribution of the nodes and lines and its importance in generating synthetic
power grids.

are the translations. For the case in which $\Lambda$ is an interval in
$\mathbb{Z}$ we give a simple necessary and sufficient condition, local
translation invariance (LTI), for extendibility. For LTI measures we construct
extensions having maximal entropy, which we show are Gibbs measures; this
construction extends to the case in which $\mathbb{L}$ is the Bethe lattice. On
$\mathbb{Z}$ we also consider extensions supported on periodic configurations,
which are analyzed using de~Bruijn graphs and which include the extensions with
minimal entropy. When $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{Z}$ is not an interval, or when
$\Lambda\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d>1$, the LTI condition is necessary but not
sufficient for extendibility. For $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d>1$, extendibility is
in some sense undecidable.

build some one-dimensional densities depending on many parameters and then
treat the constructed in this way distributions as conditional ones. Then of
course by imposing certain distribution on the parameters and multiplying the
two distributions we arrive at new multivariate distribution. To enable
effective calculations, we utilize nice, simple and widely known properties of
Chebyshev polynomials. Thus, in particular, the one-dimensional distribution

collimated by a dusty structure surrounding the nucleus. At the center of the
ionization cone, outflowing ionized gas is revealed as a blueshifted,
asymmetric wing of the [OIII] emission line, up to projected velocity
v(10)~-450 km/s. The outflow is also seen as a diffuse, low luminosity radio
and X-ray jet, with similar extension. The outflowing material points in the
direction of two clumps characterized by prominent line emission with spectra
typical of HII regions, located at the edge of the dust lane of the bar. We
propose that the star formation in the clumps is due to `positive feedback'
induced by gas compression by the nuclear outflow, providing the first
candidate for outflow induced star formation in a Seyfert-like radio quiet AGN.
This suggests that positive feedback may be a relevant mechanism in shaping the
black hole-host galaxy coevolution.

the quantum Hall states with integer filling factors in graphene. The analysis
is performed in the low-energy Dirac model in the mean-field approximation, in
which the long-range Coulomb interaction is modified by the one-loop static
screening effects in the presence of a background magnetic field. By utilizing
a rather general ansatz for the propagator, in which all dynamical parameters
are running functions of the Landau level index $n$, we derive a
self-consistent set of the Schwinger-Dyson (gap) equations and solve them
numerically. The explicit solutions demonstrate that static screening leads to
a substantial suppression of the gap parameters in the quantum Hall states with
a broken $U(4)$ flavor symmetry. The temperature dependence of the energy gaps
is also studied. The corresponding results mimic well the temperature
dependence of the activation energies measured in experiment. It is also argued
that, in principle, the Landau level running of the quasiparticle dynamical
parameters could be measured via optical studies of the integer quantum Hall

Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will improve measurements of the cosmological
distance scale by applying the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) method to
quasar samples. eBOSS will adopt two approaches to target quasars over 7500 sq.
deg. First, a ""CORE"" quasar sample will combine optical selection in ugriz
using a likelihood-based routine called XDQSOz, with a mid-IR-optical
color-cut. eBOSS CORE selection (to g < 22 OR r < 22) should return ~ 70
quasars per sq. deg. at redshifts 0.9 < z < 2.2 and ~7 z > 2.1 quasars per sq.
deg. Second, a selection based on variability in multi-epoch imaging from the
Palomar Transient Factory should recover an additional ~3-4 z > 2.1 quasars per
sq. deg. to g < 22.5. A linear model of how imaging systematics affect target
density recovers the angular distribution of eBOSS CORE quasars over 96.7%
(76.7%) of the SDSS North (South) Galactic Cap area. The eBOSS CORE quasar
sample should thus be sufficiently dense and homogeneous over 0.9 < z < 2.2 to
yield the first few-percent-level BAO constraint near z~1.5. eBOSS quasars at z
> 2.1 will be used to improve BAO measurements in the Lyman-alpha Forest.
Beyond its key cosmological goals, eBOSS should be the next-generation quasar
survey, comprising > 500,000 new quasars and > 500,000 uniformly selected
spectroscopically confirmed 0.9 < z < 2.2 quasars. At the conclusion of eBOSS,
the SDSS will have provided unique spectra of over 800,000 quasars.

novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point
Observatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain
Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the
Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for
studies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the
distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Using more
than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median
redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of $d_A(z)$ to
an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1% when combined with the
z>0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ~195,000 new emission line galaxy
redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 3.1% and
H(z) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000
spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance
measurements over the redshift range 0.9<z<2.2, with expected precision of 2.8%
and 4.2% on $d_A(z)$ and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars
and re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new
Lyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z>2.1; these new data will enhance
the precision of $d_A(z)$ and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS.
Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on
cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved
tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints
on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the
cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral
quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.

star clusters, the two youngest of which are centrally concentrated and
surrounded by thermal radio emission (the `radio nebula'). To investigate the
role of these clusters in the starburst energetics, we combine new and archival
Hubble Space Telescope images of NGC5253 with wavelength coverage from 1500 Ang
to 1.9 micron in 13 filters. These include H-alpha, P-beta, and P-alpha, and
the imaging from the Hubble Treasury Program LEGUS (Legacy Extragalactic UV
Survey). The extraordinarily well-sampled spectral energy distributions enable
modeling with unprecedented accuracy the ages, masses, and extinctions of the 9
optically brightest clusters (M_V < -8.8) and the two young radio nebula
clusters. The clusters have ages ~1-15 Myr and masses ~1x10^4 - 2.5x10^5 M_sun.
The clusters' spatial location and ages indicate that star formation has become
more concentrated towards the radio nebula over the last ~15 Myr. The most
massive cluster is in the radio nebula; with a mass 2.5x10^5 M_sun and an age
~1 Myr, it is 2-4 times less massive and younger than previously estimated. It
is within a dust cloud with A_V~50 mag, and shows a clear nearIR excess, likely
from hot dust. The second radio nebula cluster is also ~1 Myr old, confirming
the extreme youth of the starburst region. These two clusters account for about
half of the ionizing photon rate in the radio nebula, and will eventually
supply about 2/3 of the mechanical energy in present-day shocks. Additional
sources are required to supply the remaining ionizing radiation, and may
include very massive stars.

defective items from a set of $n$ items by pooling groups of items efficiently
in order to cut down the number of tests needed. The result of a test for a
group of items is positive if any of the items in the group is defective and
negative otherwise. The goal is to judiciously group subsets of items such that
defective items can be reliably recovered using the minimum number of tests,
while also having a low-complexity decoding procedure.
  We describe SAFFRON (Sparse-grAph codes Framework For gROup testiNg), a
non-adaptive group testing paradigm that recovers at least a
$(1-\epsilon)$-fraction (for any arbitrarily small $\epsilon > 0$) of $K$
defective items with high probability with $m=6C(\epsilon)K\log_2{n}$ tests,
where $C(\epsilon)$ is a precisely characterized constant that depends only on
$\epsilon$. For instance, it can provably recover at least $(1-10^{-6})K$
defective items with $m \simeq 68 K \log_2{n}$ tests. The computational
complexity of the decoding algorithm of SAFFRON is $\mathcal{O}(K\log n)$,
which is order-optimal. Further, we robustify SAFFRON such that it can reliably
recover the set of $K$ defective items even in the presence of erroneous or
noisy test results. We also propose Singleton-Only-SAFFRON, a variant of
SAFFRON, that recovers all the $K$ defective items with $m=2e(1+\alpha)K\log K
\log_2 n$ tests with probability
$1-\mathcal{O}{\left(\frac{1}{K^\alpha}\right)}$, where $\alpha>0$ is a
constant. By leveraging powerful design and analysis tools from modern

identifiability by making a one component sharing assumption and derive a
parameter learning algorithm for this case. Our approach is based on a
dictionary learning problem of the form $X = O R$, where the goal is to learn
the dictionary $O$ given the data matrix $X$. We argue that due to the specific
structure of the activation matrix $R$ in the shared component factorial
mixture model, and an incoherence assumption on the shared component, it is
possible to extract the columns of the $O$ matrix without the need for
alternating between the estimation of $O$ and $R$.

decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal
coefficients in time are known. By extracting key temporal coherent structures
(portfolios) in its sampling window, it provides a regression to a best fit
linear dynamical system, allowing for a predictive assessment of the market
dynamics and informing an investment strategy. The data-driven analytics
capitalizes on stock market patterns, either real or perceived, to inform
buy/sell/hold investment decisions. Critical to the method is an associated
learning algorithm that optimizes the sampling and prediction windows of the

structure of the algorithms is rooted in methods from nonlinear dynamical
systems and shows that the decomposition is an effective mathematical tool for
data-driven discovery of market patterns.

cohort is assumed, allowing non-dose-related factors to be ignored. Clinically
realistic DVHs are combined with the injury model to simulate RP data. Results:
Correlation analysis is often used to identify predictor variables that are
correlated with outcome, for inclusion in a predictive model. In the local
injury model, all DVH metrics VD contribute to damage. Correlation analysis
therefore has limited value. The subset of VD significantly correlated with
incidence varies randomly from trial to trial due to random variations in the
DVH set, and does not necessarily reveal anything useful about the patient
cohort or the underlying biological dose-response relationship. Regression or
matrix analysis can extract R(D) from damage or risk data, provided smoothness
regularization is employed. Extraction of R(D) from incidence data was not
successful, due to its higher level of statistical variability. Conclusions: To
the author's knowledge, smoothness regularization has not been applied to this
problem, so represents a novel approach. Dose-response functions can be
successfully extracted from measurements of integral (as opposed to regional)
lung damage G, suggesting value in re-visiting available measurements of
ventilation, perfusion and radiographic damage. The techniques developed here
can potentially be used to extract the dose-response functions of different
tissues from multiple types of quantitative volumetric imaging data.

long-term stability can only be answered in a statistical sense, e.g. based on
numerical ensemble integrations of nearby orbits. Destabilization, including
catastrophic encounters and/or collisions involving the Earth, has been
suggested to be initiated through a large increase in Mercury's eccentricity
(eM), with an estimated probability of ~1%. However, it has recently been shown
that the statistics of numerical Solar System integrations are sensitive to the
accuracy and type of numerical algorithm. Here I report results from
computationally demanding ensemble integrations (N=1,600 with slightly
different initial conditions) at unprecedented accuracy based on the full
equations of motion of the eight planets and Pluto over 5Gyr, including
contributions from general relativity. The standard symplectic algorithm
produced spurious results for highly eccentric orbits and during close
encounters, which were hence integrated with a suitable Bulirsch-Stoer
algorithm, specifically designed for these situations. The present study yields
odds for a large increase in Mercury's eccentricity that are less than previous
estimates. Strikingly, in two solutions Mercury continued on highly eccentric
orbits (after reaching eM values >0.93) for 80-100Myr before colliding with
Venus or the Sun. Most importantly, none of the 1,600 solutions led to a close
encounter involving the Earth or a destabilization of Earth's orbit in the
future. I conclude that Earth's orbit is dynamically highly stable for billions
of years, despite the chaotic behavior of the Solar System.

quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure have attracted considerable interest.
The crystal structure consists of double-walled tubes of [Cr3As3]^(2-) that
extend along the c-axis. Previously we reported measurements of the change in
London penetration depth of polycrystalline samples of K2Cr3As3 using a tunnel
diode oscillator based technique, which show a linear temperature dependence at
low temperatures, giving evidence for line nodes in the superconducting gap.
Here we report similar measurements of the penetration depth for
polycrystalline Rb2Cr3As3 and several single crystals of K2Cr3As3, prepared by
two different research groups. The single crystal measurements show similar
behavior to polycrystalline samples down to 0.9-1.2 K, where a downturn is
observed in the frequency shift for all single crystal samples. These results
give further evidence for nodal superconductivity in K2Cr3As3, which indicates
that the superconducting pairing state is unconventional. The different low
temperature behavior observed in samples which have deteriorated after being
exposed to air, emphasises that it is necessary to properly handle the samples
prior to being measured because the A2Cr3As3 compounds are extremely air
sensitive and evidence for nodal superconductivity from penetration depth
measurements is only observed in the samples which display a sharp
superconducting transition. Therefore further work is required to improve the
quality of single crystals and to identify the origin of the downturn.

hashing functions are two crucial steps in image retrieval . Conventional
methods often study these two steps separately, e.g., learning hash functions
from a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile, the bit lengths of
output hashing codes are preset in most previous methods, neglecting the
significance level of different bits and restricting their practical
flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a supervised learning
framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw
images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity
learning. Specifically, we organize the training images into a batch of triplet
samples, each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a
different label. With these triplet samples, we maximize the margin between
matched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition, a
regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e.,
images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional
neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion, where
discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized.
Furthermore, each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can
manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and
also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification
in surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes
well preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.

strategy for overcoming them by studying the gas phase and bulk electronic
structure of the organic molecule quinacridone (5Q), a promising material with
many interesting properties for organic devices. Experimentally, we perform
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARUPS) on thin films of the

range-separated hybrid functional (OT-RSH) within density functional theory.
For the gas phase molecule, our OT-RSH result for the ionization potential (IP)
represents a substantial improvement over the semi-local PBE and the PBE0
hybrid functional results, producing an IP in quantitative agreement with
experiment. For the bulk crystal, we take into account the correct screening in
the bulk, using the recently developed OT-SRSH approach, while retaining the
optimally-tuned parameters for the range-separation and the short-range Fock
exchange. This leads to a band gap narrowing due to polarization effects and
results in a valence band spectrum in excellent agreement with experimental
ARUPS data, with respect to both peak positions and heights. Finally,
full-frequency $G_0W_0$ results based on a hybrid functional starting point are

Starting from the Keldysh approach, we develop a formalism, the
Floquet-Boltzmann equation, to describe the dynamics and the scattering of
quasiparticles in such systems. The theory builds on a separation of
time-scales. Rapid, periodic oscillations occurring on a time scale $T_0=2
\pi/\Omega$, are treated using the Floquet formalism and quasiparticles are
defined as eigenstates of a non-interacting Floquet Hamiltonian. The dynamics
on much longer time scales, however, is modelled by a Boltzmann equation which
describes the semiclassical dynamics of the Floquet-quasiparticles and their
scattering processes. As the energy is conserved only modulo $\hbar \Omega$,
the interacting system heats up in the long-time limit. As a first application
of this approach, we compute the heating rate for a cold-atom system, where a
periodical shaking of the lattice was used to realize the Haldane model.

interest in recent years. It has a wide variety of applications in disease
diagnosis, neuroimaging, etc. Most research on subgraph mining focuses on the
graph representation alone. However, in many real-world applications, the side
information is available along with the graph data. For example, for
neurological disorder identification, in addition to the brain networks derived
from neuroimaging data, hundreds of clinical, immunologic, serologic and
cognitive measures may also be documented for each subject. These measures
compose multiple side views encoding a tremendous amount of supplemental
information for diagnostic purposes, yet are often ignored. In this paper, we
study the problem of discriminative subgraph selection using multiple side
views and propose a novel solution to find an optimal set of subgraph features
for graph classification by exploring a plurality of side views. We derive a
feature evaluation criterion, named gSide, to estimate the usefulness of
subgraph patterns based upon side views. Then we develop a branch-and-bound
algorithm, called gMSV, to efficiently search for optimal subgraph features by
integrating the subgraph mining process and the procedure of discriminative
feature selection. Empirical studies on graph classification tasks for
neurological disorders using brain networks demonstrate that subgraph patterns
selected by the multi-side-view guided subgraph selection approach can
effectively boost graph classification performances and are relevant to disease
diagnosis.

is a powerful method to constrain a merger dynamics. Two-dimensional shear
fitting using a clean background catalog suggests that the cluster undergoes a
merger with a mass ratio of about 2:1. The main halo is located around the gas
core in the southern region, while no concentrated gas core is associated with
the northern sub halo. We find that the projected cluster mass distribution

lack of the northern gas core. The lack of a prominent radio halo enables us to
constrain an upper limit of the fractional energy of magneto-hydrodynamics

increases neuroplasticity and leads to creation of new pathways spreading
neural activation. Using the language of neurodynamics a meme is defined as
quasi-stable associative memory attractor state. Depending on the temporal
characteristics of the incoming information and the plasticity of the network,
memory may self-organize creating memes with large attractor basins, linking
many unrelated input patterns. Memes with fake rich associations distort
relations between memory states. Simulations of various neural network models
trained with competitive Hebbian learning (CHL) on stationary and
non-stationary data lead to the same conclusion: short learning with high
plasticity followed by rapid decrease of plasticity leads to memes with large

distorted beliefs and formation of conspiracy memes, understood as strong
attractor states of the neurodynamics.

spectroscopy, and in particular line-of-sight absorption variability, is a key
diagnostic to map out the distribution of gas. Observations of variable X-ray
absorption in multiple Seyferts and over a wide range of timescales indicate
the presence of clumps/clouds of gas within the circumnuclear material. Eclipse
events by clumps transiting the line of sight allow us to explore the
properties of the clumps over a wide range of radial distances from the
optical/UV Broad Line Region (BLR) to beyond the dust sublimation radius.
Time-resolved absorption events have been extremely rare so far, but suggest a
range of density profiles across Seyferts. We resolve a weeks-long absorption
event in the Seyfert NGC 3227. We examine six Suzaku and twelve Swift
observations from a 2008 campaign spanning 5 weeks. We use a model accounting

behavior. We also examine the IR-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) to
test for reddening by dust. The 2008 absorption event is due to
moderately-ionized ($\log \xi\sim 1.2-1.4$) gas covering 90% of the line of
sight. We resolve the density profile to be highly irregular, in contrast to a
previous symmetric and centrally-peaked event mapped with RXTE in the same

the low-FIP ion magnesium to uncover correlations that are not apparent when
normalizing to high-FIP ions. We find that relative to magnesium, the other
low-FIP elements are measurably fractionated, but the degree of fractionation
does not vary significantly over the solar cycle. For the high-FIP ions,
variation in fractionation over the solar cycle is significant: greatest for
Ne/Mg and C/Mg, less so for O/Mg, and the least for He/Mg. When abundance
ratios are examined as a function of solar wind speed, we find a strong
correlation, with the remarkable observation that the degree of fractionation
follows a mass-dependent trend. We discuss the implications for correcting the

model"", and hosted on an existing high-performance computer. It will be a means
for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to
create new versions of it. The SP system is a unique attempt to simplify and
integrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream
computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition, with information
compression as a unifying theme. Potential benefits and applications include
helping to solve problems associated with big data; facilitating the
development of autonomous robots; unsupervised learning, natural language
processing, several kinds of reasoning, fuzzy pattern recognition at multiple
levels of abstraction, computer vision, best-match and semantic forms of
information retrieval, software engineering, medical diagnosis, simplification
of computing systems, and the seamless integration of diverse kinds of
knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Additional motivations include
the potential of the SP system to help solve problems in defence, security, and
the detection and prevention of crime; potential in terms of economic, social,
environmental, and academic criteria, and in terms of publicity; and the
potential for international influence in research. The main elements of the
proposed facility are described, including support for the development of
""SP-neural"", a neural version of the SP machine. The facility should be
permanent in the sense that it should be available for the foreseeable future,
and it should be designed to facilitate its use by researchers anywhere in the
world.

Spirals into S0 galaxies in the cluster environment exploiting two big
databases of galaxy clusters: WINGS (0.04 < z < 0.07) and EDisCS (0.4 < z <
0.8). The most important results are: 1) the average number of S0 galaxies in
clusters is almost a factor of $\sim 3 - 4$ larger today than at redshift $z
\sim 1$; 2) the fraction of S0's to Spirals increases on average by a factor
$\sim$ 2 every Gyr; 3) the average rate of transformation for Spirals (not
considering the infall of new galaxies from the cosmic web) is: $\sim$ 5 Sp
into S0's per Gyr and $\sim$ 2 Sp into E's per Gyr; 4) there are evidences that
the interstellar gas of Spirals is stripped by an hot intergalactic medium; 5)
there are also indirect hints that major/minor merging events have played a
role in the transformation of Spiral galaxies. In particular, we show that: 1)
the ratio between the number of S0's and Spirals (NS0/NSp) in the WINGS
clusters is correlated with their X-ray luminosity $L_X$ ; 2) that the
brightest and massive S0's are always close to the cluster center; 3) that the
mean Sersic index of S0's is always larger than that of Spirals (and lower than
E's) for galaxy stellar masses above $10^9.5$ Msun; 4) that the number of E's
in clusters cannot be constant; 5) that the largest difference between the mean
mass of S0's and E's with respect to Spirals is observed in clusters with low
velocity dispersion. Finally, by comparing the properties of the various
morphological types for galaxies in clusters and in the field, we find that the
most significant effect of the environment is the stripping of the outer galaxy
regions, resulting in a systematic difference in effective radius and Sersic
index.

algorithms wait until observing actual outcomes before performing the
computations to update their predictions. If predictions are made at a high

required to store all relevant observations and to update all predictions when
the outcome is finally observed. We show that the exact same predictions can be
learned in a much more computationally congenial way, with uniform per-step
computation that does not depend on the span of the predictions. We apply this
idea to various settings of increasing generality, repeatedly adding desired
properties and each time deriving an equivalent span-independent algorithm for
the conventional algorithm that satisfies these desiderata. Interestingly,
along the way several known algorithmic constructs emerge spontaneously from
our derivations, including dutch eligibility traces, temporal difference
errors, and averaging. This allows us to link these constructs one-to-one to
the corresponding desiderata, unambiguously connecting the `how' to the `why'.
Each step, we make sure that the derived algorithm subsumes the previous
algorithms, thereby retaining their properties. Ultimately we arrive at a
single general temporal-difference algorithm that is applicable to the full

stabilised trilinear equal-order finite elements in a parallel framework

paper, we analyze a generalized procedure to create Bell pairs encoded
heterogeneously between two separate codes used often in error corrected
quantum repeater network designs. We begin with a physical Bell pair, then
encode each qubit in a different error correcting code, using entanglement
purification to increase the fidelity. We investigate three separate protocols
for preparing the purified encoded Bell pair. We calculate the error
probability of those schemes between the Steane [[7,1,3]] code, a distance
three surface code and single physical qubits by Monte Carlo simulation under a
standard Pauli error model, and estimate the resource efficiency of the
procedures. A local gate error rate of $10^{-3}$ allows us to create
high-fidelity logical Bell pairs between any of our chosen codes. We find that
a postselected model, where any detected parity flips in code stabilizers
result in a restart of the protocol, performs the best.

frequencies and amplitudes within which the system evolves toward significantly
different states. Therefore, observation of system evolution should provide
information about the characteristics of the perturbation. The discrimination
properties for periodic perturbation are generic. They can be observed in
various dynamical systems and for different types of periodic perturbation.

vanishing at left endpoint (DN-case). Secondly, the condition is the case that
the sequences vanish at two endpoints (DD-case). The third type of condition is
the generality of the mean zero condition (NN-case), which is motivated from

Engagement measures typically rely on the dynamics of the social signals
exchanged by the partners, especially speech and gaze. However, the dynamics of
these signals is likely to be influenced by individual and social factors, such
as personality traits, as it is well documented that they critically influence
how two humans interact with each other. Here, we assess the influence of two
factors, namely extroversion and negative attitude toward robots, on speech and
gaze during a cooperative task, where a human must physically manipulate a
robot to assemble an object. We evaluate if the scores of extroversion and
negative attitude towards robots co-variate with the duration and frequency of
gaze and speech cues. The experiments were carried out with the humanoid robot
iCub and N=56 adult participants. We found that the more people are extrovert,
the more and longer they tend to talk with the robot; and the more people have
a negative attitude towards robots, the less they will look at the robot face
and the more they will look at the robot hands where the assembly and the
contacts occur. Our results confirm and provide evidence that the engagement
models classically used in human-robot interaction should take into account
attitudes and personality traits.

diagram of a FeSe system. Both superconductivity and structural transition /
orbital order are suppressed by the Co replacement on the Fe sites and
disappear above $x$ = 0.036. These correlated suppressions represent a common
background physics behind these physical phenomena in the multiband Fermi
surfaces of FeSe. By comparing experimental data and theories so far proposed,
the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$ against the residual resistivity is shown to be
much weaker than that predicted in the case of a general sign reversal and a
full gap $s_{\pm}$ models. The origin of the superconducting paring in FeSe is

Regarding each edge as two half edges, an orientation of a signed graph is an

receive opposite directions. A signed graph with such an orientation is called
a bidirected graph. A nowhere-zero $k$-flow of a bidirected graph is an

galaxies are understood to be too large to be accounted for by free streaming
of warm dark matter without overly suppressing the formation of such galaxies.
Here we demonstrate with cosmological simulations that wave dark matter,
$\psi$DM, appropriate for light bosons such as axions, does not suffer this
problem, given a boson mass of $m_{\psi} \ge 1.2 \times 10^{-22}{\,\rm eV}$
($2\sigma$). In this case, the halo mass function is suppressed below $\sim
10^{10}{\,M_\odot}$ at a level that is consistent with the high-z luminosity
functions, while simultaneously generating the kpc-scale cores in dwarf
galaxies arising from the solitonic ground state in $\psi$DM. We demonstrate
that the reionization history in this scenario is consistent with the Thomson
optical depth recently reported by Planck, assuming a reasonable ionizing
photon production rate. We predict that the luminosity function should turn
over slowly around an intrinsic UV luminosity of $M_{\rm UV} \gtrsim -16$ at $z
\gtrsim 4$. We also show that for galaxies magnified $\mathord{>}10\times$ in
the Hubble Frontier Fields, $\psi$DM predicts an order of magnitude fewer
detections than cold dark matter at $z \gtrsim 10$ down to $M_{\rm UV} \sim
-15$, allowing us to distinguish between these very different interpretations

which is a major feature allowing classical coordinate descent to perform so
well when it is applicable. We then prove a sublinear rate of convergence in

data and control flow analysis to diagnose potential security bugs, and outputs
well-formatted bug reports that help developers understand and fix security

themselves across multiple parts of a program, Melange performs both local and
global analyses. To scale up to large programs, global analysis is
demand-driven. Our prototype detects multiple vulnerability classes in C and
C++ code including type confusion, and garbage memory reads. We have evaluated
Melange extensively. Our case studies show that Melange scales up to large

discovering vulnerabilities in real-world code. Our findings indicate that
static analysis is a viable reinforcement to the software testing tool set.

to be the same as that for complete fusion, whereas for heavy systems leading

reduced due to the quasifission (QF) and fusion-fission processes thus making
the capture cross-section to be essentially the sum of these two
cross-sections, with QF occurring at a much shorter time-scale. Consequently,
quasifission is the primary reaction mechanism that limits the formation of
superheavy nuclei. Within the last few years the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(TDHF) approach has been utilized for studying the dynamics of quasifission.
The study of quasifission is showing a great promise to provide insight based

is an essential task when conducting research in fluid dynamics. This typically
involves the construction of an empirical mode base that appropriately captures
the dominant flow structures. The most prominent candidates are the
energy-ranked proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the frequency ranked
Fourier decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). However, these
methods fail when the relevant coherent structures occur at low energies or at
multiple frequencies, which is often the case. To overcome the deficit of these
""rigid"" approaches, we propose a new method termed Spectral Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (SPOD). It is based on classical POD and it can be applied to
spatially and temporally resolved data. The new method involves an additional
temporal constraint that enables a clear separation of phenomena that occur at
multiple frequencies and energies. SPOD allows for a continuous shifting from
the energetically optimal POD to the spectrally pure Fourier decomposition by
changing a single parameter. In this article, SPOD is motivated from
phenomenological considerations of the POD autocorrelation matrix and justified
from dynamical system theory. The new method is further applied to three sets
of PIV measurements of flows from very different engineering problems. We
consider the flow of a swirl-stabilized combustor, the wake of an airfoil with
a Gurney flap, and the flow field of the sweeping jet behind a fluidic
oscillator. For these examples, the commonly used methods fail to assign the
relevant coherent structures to single modes. The SPOD, however, achieves a
proper separation of spatially and temporally coherent structures, which are
either hidden in stochastic turbulent fluctuations or spread over a wide
frequency range.

vertex in a flow network, we can also interpret it as a tensor network, and
more specifically, as a linear map from the input space to the output space.
The quantum max flow is defined to be the maximal rank of this linear map over
all choices of tensors. The quantum min cut is defined to be the minimum
product of the capacities of edges over all cuts of the tensor network. We show
that unlike the classical case, the quantum max-flow=min-cut conjecture is not
true in general. Under certain conditions, e.g., when the capacity on each edge
is some power of a fixed integer, the quantum max-flow is proved to equal the
quantum min-cut. However, concrete examples are also provided where the
equality does not hold.

by statistical physicists, and supported by a large amount of numerical
evidence over the last decade [23, 24, 28, 63] is as follows: for a wide array
of random graph models with degree exponent $\tau\in (3,4)$, distances between
typical points both within maximal components in the critical regime as well as
on the minimal spanning tree on the giant component in the supercritical regime
scale like $n^{(\tau-3)/(\tau-1)}$.
  In this paper we study the metric space structure of maximal components of
the multiplicative coalescent, in the regime where the sizes converge to
excursions of L\'evy processes ""without replacement"" [10], yielding a
completely new class of limiting random metric spaces. A by-product of the
analysis yields the continuum scaling limit of one fundamental class of random
graph models with degree exponent $\tau\in (3,4)$ where edges are rescaled by
$n^{-(\tau-3)/(\tau-1)}$ yielding the first rigorous proof of the above
conjecture. The limits in this case are compact ""tree-like"" random fractals
with finite fractal dimensions and with a dense collection of hubs (infinite
degree vertices) a finite number of which are identified with leaves to form
shortcuts. In a special case, we show that the Minkowski dimension of the
limiting spaces equal $(\tau-2)/(\tau-3)$ a.s., in stark contrast to the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi scaling limit whose Minkowski dimension is 2 a.s. It is
generally believed that dynamic versions of a number of fundamental random
graph models, as one moves from the barely subcritical to the critical regime
can be approximated by the multiplicative coalescent. In work in progress, the
general theory developed in this paper is used to prove analogous limit results
for other random graph models with degree exponent $\tau\in (3,4)$.

initial eccentricity required by Kepler planets to explain the current observed

particular, we investigate 27 Kepler systems having planets within 6% of the
2:1 MMR, and find that the initial eccentricities required to explain the
observed spacings are unreasonable from simple dynamical arguments.
Furthermore, our numerical simulations reveal resonant tugging, an effect which
conspires against the migration of resonant planets away from the 2:1 MMR,
requiring even higher initial eccentricities in order to explain the current
Kepler distribution. Overall, we find that tides alone cannot explain planets
close to 2:1 MMR, and additional mechanisms are required to explain these
systems.

shape using a fixed source with variable intensity for the diffusion. More
specifically, we look for a control driving a symmetric manifold shape to any
other symmetric shape in a given time interval. For the diffusion we take
directly the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the surface, while the surface growth
is assumed to be equal to the value of the diffused quantity. We introduce a
theoretical framework, provide approximate controllability and show numerical
results. Future applications include a specific model for the oogenesis of

wide enough so as to accommodate a generic choice of chemical potentials

admit parity-odd terms in the action. It is then shown that the asymptotic

the coupling of the Lorentz-Chern-Simons form. The generalization of these

tremendously. Light curve modelling furthermore favours abundant pair
production in MSP magnetospheres, so that models of primary cosmic-ray
positrons from pulsars should include the contribution from the larger numbers
of MSPs and their potentially higher positron output per source. We model the
contribution of Galactic MSPs to the terrestrial cosmic-ray electron / positron
flux by using a population synthesis code to predict the source properties of

strong intrabinary shocks in black widow (BW) and redback (RB) binary systems.
We transport these particles to Earth by calculating their diffusion and the
radiative energy losses they suffer in the Galaxy using a model. Our model
particle flux increases for non-zero offsets of the magnetic polar caps. We
find that pair cascades from MSP magnetospheres contribute only modestly around

the evolution. Finally we also use the observational data to fix the problem
parameters that match best with the real picture of the evolution. The
assessment of the age of the Universe in case of the soft beginning of
expansion (initial speed of expansion in a point of singularity is equal to
zero) the age was found 15 billion years, whereas in case of the hard beginning
(nontrivial initial speed) it was found that the Universe is 13.7 billion years
old.

enables us to obtain the entanglement entropy of a corresponding quantum state
by means of holography. We find that the positivity of the entropy leads to the
presence of past and future causal cones in the Minkowski spacetime. We also
find that the quantum state is equivalent to the thermofield-double state, and
then the entropy is proportional to the temperature. The proportionality is
consistent with previous holographic works. The present Hessian geometrical

potentials and check their viability in light of the Planck 2015 data. We see
that in this scenario, the inverse power-law potential
$V(\phi)=V_{0}(\phi/\phi_{0})^{-n}$ with $n=2$ leads to the power-law inflation
with the scale factor $a(t)\propto t^{q}$ where $q>1$, while with $n<2$, it
gives rise to the intermediate inflation with the scale factor
$a(t)\propto\exp\left(At^{f}\right)$ where $A>0$ and $0<f<1$. We find that,
although the inverse power-law potential with $n\leq 2$ is completely ruled out
by the Planck 2015 data, the result of this potential for $n>2$ can be
compatible with the 95\% CL region of Planck 2015 TT, TE, EE+lowP data. We
further conclude that the exponential potential
$V(\phi)=V_{0}e^{-\phi/\phi_{0}}$, the inverse $\cosh$ potential
$V(\phi)=V_{0}/\cosh(\phi/\phi_{0})$, and the mutated exponential potential
$V(\phi)=V_{0}\left[1+(n-1)^{-(n-1)}(\phi/\phi_{0})^{n}\right]e^{-\phi/\phi_{0}}$

we also estimate the running of the scalar spectral index $dn_{s}/d\ln k$ and

acquire elastic properties over experimental timescales. We investigate the
possibility of a visco-elastic flow instability in curved geometry for such
materials. To this end, we first present a general strategy extending a
first-principles approach based on projections onto slow variables (so far
restricted to strictly homogeneous flow) in order to handle inhomogeneities. In
particular, we separate the advection of the microstructure by the flow, at the
origin of a fluctuation advection term, from the intrinsic dynamics. On account
of the complexity of the involved equations, we then opt for a drastic
simplification of the theory, in order to establish its potential to describe
instabilities. These very strong approximations lead to a constitutive equation
of the White-Metzner class, whose parameters are fitted with experimental
measurements of the macroscopic rheology of a glass-forming colloidal
dispersion. The model properly accounts for the shear-thinning properties of
the dispersions, but, owing to the approximations, the description is not fully
quantitative. Finally, we perform a linear stability analysis of the flow in
the experimentally relevant cylindrical (Taylor-Couette) geometry and provide
evidence that shear-thinning strongly stabilises the flow, which can explain
why visco-elastic instabilities are not observed in dense colloidal
suspensions.
