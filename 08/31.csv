  (PCITC) accepted, preprinted",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detection of vehicle position is critical for successful operation of
intelligent transportation system. In case of railroad transportation systems,
position information of railroad vehicles can be detected by GPS, track
circuits, and so on. In this paper, position detection based on tags onto
sleepers of the track is investigated. Position information stored in the tags
is read by a reader placed at the bottom of running railroad vehicle. Due to
limited capacity of battery or its alternative in the tags, power required for
transmission of position information to the reader is harvested by the tags
from the power wirelessly transferred from the reader. Basic mechanism in
wireless power transfer is magnetic induction and power transfer efficiency
according to the relative location of the reader to a tag is discussed with
simulation results. Since power transfer efficiency is significantly affected
by the ferromagnetic material (steel) at the bottom of the railroad vehicle and
the track, magnetic beam shaping by ferrite material is carried out. With the
ferrite material for magnetic beam shaping, degradation of power transfer
efficiency due to the steel is substantially reduced. Based on the experimental
results, successful wireless power transfer to the tag coil is possible when
transmitted power from the reader coil is close to a few watts.

electromagnetic field, especially provided by strong laser facilities at

usage of analytical solutions of the particle dynamical equation, such as the
Klein-Gordon equation and Dirac equation. However only for limited field
configurations such as a plane-wave field could the equations be solved
analytically. Studies have shown significant interests in QED processes in a
strong field composed of two counter-propagating laser waves, but the exact
solutions in such a field is out of reach. In this paper, inspired by the
observation of the structure of the solutions in a plane-wave field, we develop
a new method and obtain the analytical solution for the Klein-Gordon equation
and equivalently the action function of the solution for the Dirac equation in
this field, under a largest dynamical parameter condition that there exists an
inertial frame in which the particle free momentum is far larger than the other
field dynamical parameters. The applicable range of the new solution is
demonstrated and its validity is proven clearly. The result has the advantage
of Lorentz covariance, clear structure and close similarity to the solution in
a plane-wave field, and thus favors convenient application.

between a pursuer $P$ and an adversarial evader $E$. Both players can move in a
straight line to any point within unit distance during their turn. The pursuer
$P$ wins by capturing the evader, meaning that their distance satisfies $d(P,
E) \leq 1$, while the evader wins by eluding capture forever. Both players have
a map of the environment, but they have different sensing capabilities. The
evader $E$ always knows the location of $P$. Meanwhile, $P$ only has
line-of-sight visibility: $P$ observes the evader's position only when the line
segment connecting them lies entirely within the polygon. Therefore $P$ must
search for $E$ when the evader is hidden from view.
  We provide a winning strategy for $P$ in two families of polygons: monotone
polygons and scallop polygons. In both families, a straight line $L$ can be
moved continuously over $Q$ so that (1) $L \cap Q$ is a line segment and (2)
every point on the boundary $\partial Q$ is swept exactly once. These are both
subfamilies of strictly sweepable polygons. The sweeping motion for a monotone
polygon is a single translation, and the sweeping motion for a scallop polygon
is a single rotation. Our algorithms use rook's strategy during its pursuit
phase, rather than the well-known lion's strategy. The rook's strategy is
crucial for obtaining a capture time that is linear in the area of $Q$. For
both monotone and scallop polygons, our algorithm has a capture time of $O(n(Q)

have globally regular solutions. The inviscid surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG)
equation has a Biot-Savart law which is one derivative less regular than in the
Euler case, and the question of global regularity for its solutions is still
open. We study here the patch dynamics in the half-plane for a family of active
scalars which interpolates between these two equations, via a parameter
$\alpha\in[0,\frac 12]$ appearing in the kernels of their Biot-Savart laws. The
values $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha=\frac 12$ correspond to the 2D Euler and SQG
cases, respectively. We prove global in time regularity for the 2D Euler patch
model, even if the patches initially touch the boundary of the half-plane. On
the other hand, for any sufficiently small $\alpha>0$, we exhibit initial data
which lead to a singularity in finite time. Thus, these results show a phase
transition in the behavior of solutions to these equations, and provide a
rigorous foundation for classifying the 2D Euler equations as critical.

linear settings, temporally growing perturbations in a non-parallel flow
represent unstable eigenmodes of the linear flow operator. In nonlinear
settings, self-sustained periodic oscillations of finite amplitude are commonly
described as nonlinear global modes. In both cases the flow dynamics may be
qualified as being endogenous, as opposed to the exogenous behaviour of
amplifier flows driven by external forcing. This paper introduces the
endogeneity concept, a specific definition of the sensitivity of the global
frequency and growth rate with respect to variations of the flow operator. The
endogeneity, defined both in linear and nonlinear settings, characterizes the
contribution of localized flow regions to the global eigendynamics. It is
calculated in a simple manner as the local point-wise inner product between the
time derivative of the direct flow state and an adjoint mode. This study
demonstrates for two canonical examples, the Ginzburg-Landau equation and the
wake of a circular cylinder, how an analysis based on the endogeneity may be
used for a physical discussion of the mechanisms that drive a global
instability. The results are shown to be consistent with earlier 'wavemaker'
definitions found in the literature, but the present formalism enables a more
detailed discussion: a clear distinction is made between oscillation frequency
and growth rate, and individual contributions from the various terms of the
flow operator can be isolated and separately discussed. [Truncated]

a chain of single-step time-independent propagating operators. Each operator is
time-specific and constructed by combining the Magnus expansion of the
time-dependent system Hamiltonian with the Chebyshev expansion of an operator
exponent. A construction of a unitary matrix of the Floquet operator, which
evolves a system state over the full modulation period, is performed by
propagating the identity matrix over the period. The independence of the
evolutions of basis vectors makes the propagation stage suitable for
implementation on a parallel cluster. Once the propagation stage is completed,
a routine diagonalization of the Floquet matrix is performed. Finally, an
additional propagation round, now with the eigenvectors as the initial states,
allows to resolve the time-dependence of the Floquet states and calculate their
characteristics. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the algorithm
by applying it to calculate the Floquet states of two quantum models, namely
(i) a synthesized random-matrix Hamiltonian and (ii) a many-body Bose-Hubbard
dimer, both of the size up to $10^4$ states.

binary simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (BSPSA). This
pseudo-gradient descent stochastic algorithm starts with an initial feature
vector and moves toward the optimal feature vector via successive iterations.
In each iteration, the current feature vector's individual components are
perturbed simultaneously by random offsets from a qualified probability
distribution. We present computational experiments on datasets with numbers of
features ranging from a few dozens to thousands using three widely-used
classifiers as wrappers: nearest neighbor, decision tree, and linear support
vector machine. We compare our methodology against the full set of features as
well as a binary genetic algorithm and sequential FS methods using
cross-validated classification error rate and AUC as the performance criteria.
Our results indicate that features selected by BSPSA compare favorably to
alternative methods in general and BSPSA can yield superior feature sets for
datasets with tens of thousands of features by examining an extremely small
fraction of the solution space. We are not aware of any other wrapper FS
methods that are computationally feasible with good convergence properties for
such large datasets.

previously carried out by Silva et al. (2013) and Barreto-Souza et al. (2011)
in introducing the compound class of extended Weibull-power series distribution

contains several lifetime models such as generalized Gompertz, generalized
Gompertz-geometric, generalized Gompertz-poisson, generalized Gompertz-binomial
distribution, and generalized Gompertz-logarithmic distribution as special
cases. The hazard rate function of the new class of distributions can be
increasing, decreasing and bathtub-shaped. We obtain several properties of this
distribution such as its probability density function, Shannon entropy, its
mean residual life and failure rate functions, quantiles and moments. The
maximum likelihood estimation procedure via a EM-algorithm is presented, and
sub-models of the distribution are studied in details.

fluctuating behaviour that have drastically changed the way to address this
problem in the realm of diffusive systems: macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT)
and a set of advanced computational techniques that make it possible to measure
the probability of rare events. Notwithstanding, a satisfactory theory is still
lacking in a particular case of intrinsically non-equilibrium systems, namely
those in which energy is not conserved but dissipated continuously in the bulk
of the system (e.g. granular media). In this work, we put forward the
dissipated energy as a relevant quantity in this case and analyse in a
pedagogical way its fluctuations, by making use of a suitable generalisation of
macroscopic fluctuation theory to driven dissipative media.

exploited despite the wide area covered on the Galactic plane. Therefore, we
investigated all the candidate Cepheids pointed out by the automatic
classification of the CoRoT curves. At the end we could identify seven
bona-fide Cepheids. The light curves were investigated to remove some
instrumental effects. The frequency analysis was particularly delicate since
these small effects can be enhanced by the large amplitude, resulting in the
presence of significant, but spurious, peaks in the power spectrum. Indeed, the
careful evaluation of a very attracting peak in the spectra of CoRoT

elements (MAEs), where each MAE corresponds to an action-related spatiotemporal
segment in the video. We introduce an unsupervised method to generate this
representation from videos. Our method is capable of distinguishing
action-related segments from background segments and representing actions at

algorithm that automatically discovers MAEs at multiple levels of granularity.
We develop structured models that capture a rich set of spatial, temporal and

levels of MAE labels are jointly inferred. The proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multiple action recognition benchmarks.
Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in real-world

in a two-dimensional box with Dirichlet boundary conditions is studied.
Confirming previous work, we find that BEC occurs at finite N at low
temperatures T without the occurrence of a phase transition. The
conventionally-defined transition temperature TE for an infinite 3D system is
shown to correspond in a 2D system with finite N to a crossover temperature
between a slow and rapid increase in the fractional boson occupation N0/N of
the ground state with decreasing T. We further show that TE ~ 1/log(N) at fixed
area per boson, so in the thermodynamic limit there is no significant BEC in 2D
at finite T. Thus, paradoxically, BEC only occurs in 2D at finite N with no
phase transition associated with it. Calculations of thermodynamic properties
versus T and area A are presented, including Helmholtz free energy, entropy S ,
pressure p, ratio of p to the energy density U/A, heat capacity at constant
volume (area) CV and at constant pressure Cp, isothermal compressibility
kappa_T and thermal expansion coefficient alpha_p, obtained using both the
grand canonical ensemble (GCE) and canonical ensemble (CE) formalisms. The GCE
formalism gives acceptable predictions for S, p, p/(U/A), kappa_T and alpha_p
at large N, T and A, but fails for smaller values of these three parameters for
which BEC becomes significant, whereas the CE formalism gives accurate results
for all thermodynamic properties of finite systems even at low T and/or A where
BEC occurs.

systems which are stealthy and hyperuniform represent new states of matter that
are endowed with novel physical and thermodynamic properties. Such stealthy and
hyperuniform states are unique in that they are transparent to radiation for a
range of wavenumbers around the origin. In this work, we employ recently
developed inverse statistical-mechanical methods, which seek to obtain the
optimal set of interactions that will spontaneously produce a targeted
structure or configuration as a unique ground state, to investigate the
spin-spin interaction potentials required to stabilize disordered stealthy
hyperuniform one-dimensional (1D) Ising-like spin chains. By performing an
exhaustive search over the spin configurations that can be enumerated on
periodic 1D integer lattices containing $N=2,3,\ldots,36$ sites, we were able
to identify and structurally characterize \textit{all} stealthy hyperuniform
spin chains in this range of system sizes. Within this pool of stealthy
hyperuniform spin configurations, we then utilized such inverse optimization
techniques to demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform spin chains can be
realized as either unique or degenerate disordered ground states of radial
long-ranged (relative to the spin chain length) spin-spin interactions. Such
exotic ground states are distinctly different from spin glasses in both their
inherent structural properties and the nature of the spin-spin interactions
required to stabilize them. As such, the implications and significance of the
existence of such disordered stealthy hyperuniform ground state spin systems
warrants further study, including whether their bulk physical properties and
excited states, like their many-particle system counterparts, are singularly
remarkable, and can be experimentally realized.

without any knowledge of the dynamics model, is treated using the
Lagrange-d'Alembert principle from variational mechanics. With body-fixed
optical and inertial sensor measurements, a Lagrangian is obtained as the
difference between a kinetic energy-like term that is quadratic in velocity
estimation error and the sum of two artificial potential functions; one
obtained from a generalization of Wahba's function for attitude estimation and
another which is quadratic in the position estimate error. An additional
dissipation term that is linear in the velocity estimation error is introduced,
and the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle is applied to the Lagrangian with this
dissipation. A Lyapunov analysis shows that the state estimation scheme so
obtained provides stable asymptotic convergence of state estimates to actual
states in the absence of measurement noise, with an almost global domain of
attraction. This estimation scheme is discretized for computer implementation
using discrete variational mechanics, as a first order Lie group variational
integrator. The continuous and discrete pose estimation schemes require optical
measurements of at least three inertially fixed landmarks or beacons in order
to estimate instantaneous pose. The discrete estimation scheme can also
estimate velocities from such optical measurements. Moreover, all states can be
estimated during time periods when measurements of only two inertial vectors,
the angular velocity vector, and one feature point position vector are
available in body frame. In the presence of bounded measurement noise in the
vector measurements, numerical simulations show that the estimated states
converge to a bounded neighborhood of the actual states.

attractive interactions than repulsive interactions. For the proof, we use a
version of the finite-dimensional quantum di Finetti theorem from [49]. A high
particle-number averaging effect is at play in the proof, which is not needed
for the corresponding estimate in the repulsive case. This a priori bound
allows us to prove that the corresponding BBGKY hierarchy converges to the GP

the bid prediction models are well studied in the literature, the equally

evaluation. Specifically, we outline the unique challenges we encounter in our
platform due to a variety of factors such as heterogeneous goal definitions,
varying budget requirements across different campaigns, high seasonality and
the auction-based environment for inventory purchasing. Then, we introduce
return on investment (ROI) as a unified model performance (i.e., success)
metric and explain its merits over more traditional metrics such as
click-through rate (CTR) or conversion rate (CVR). Most importantly, we discuss
commonly used evaluation and metric summarization approaches in detail and
propose a more accurate method for online evaluation of new experimental models
against the baseline. Our meta-analysis-based approach addresses various
shortcomings of other methods and yields statistically robust conclusions that
allow us to conclude experiments more quickly in a reliable manner. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our evaluation strategy on real campaign data

learning algorithm, Multi-Task Autoencoder (MTAE), that provides good
generalization performance for cross-domain object recognition.
  Our algorithm extends the standard denoising autoencoder framework by
substituting artificially induced corruption with naturally occurring
inter-domain variability in the appearance of objects. Instead of
reconstructing images from noisy versions, MTAE learns to transform the
original image into analogs in multiple related domains. It thereby learns
features that are robust to variations across domains. The learnt features are
then used as inputs to a classifier.
  We evaluated the performance of the algorithm on benchmark image recognition
datasets, where the task is to learn features from multiple datasets and to
then predict the image label from unseen datasets. We found that (denoising)
MTAE outperforms alternative autoencoder-based models as well as the current

We find a solution in which the average global column density,

the line-of-sight column density, $0.902^{+0.012}_{-0.013} \times 10^{24} \ \rm

required for the matter distribution to be Compton-thick. Our model accounts
for the profiles of the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ lines, and the Fe K edge
remarkably well, with a solar abundance of Fe. The matter distribution could
consist of a clumpy medium with a line-of-sight column density higher than the
global average. A uniform, spherically-symmetric distribution alone cannot
simultaneously produce the correct fluorescent line spectrum and reflection
continuum. Previous works on Mkn 3, and other AGN, that assumed a reflection
continuum from matter with an infinite column density could therefore lead to
erroneous or ""puzzling"" conclusions if the matter out of the line-of-sight is
really Compton-thin. Whereas studies of samples of AGN have generally only
probed the line-of-sight column density, with simplistic, one-dimensional
models, it is important now to establish the global column densities in AGN. It
is the global properties that affect the energy budget in terms of reprocessing

identified with the technidilaton (TD) predicted in the walking technicolor, a
pseudo Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the

constant. It reads $M_\phi^2\simeq (\frac{v_{\rm EW}}{2} \cdot \frac{5 v_{\rm

would enhance a critical temperature (Tc) of superconductivity in a doped phase
via enhancement of the binding energy of a Cooper pair as known in high-Tc
cuprates. To induce a superconductor transition in an insulating phase,
injection of a high density of carriers is needed (e.g., by impurity doping).
An electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) with an ionic liquid gate insulator
enables such a field-induced transition to be investigated and is expected to
result in a high Tc because it is free from deterioration in structure and
carrier transport that are in general caused by conventional carrier doping
(e.g., chemical substitution). Here, for insulating epitaxial thin films (~10
nm thick) of FeSe, we report a high Tc of 35 K, which is four times higher than
that of bulk FeSe, using an EDLT under application of a gate bias of +5.5 V.
Hall effect measurements under the gate bias suggest that highly accumulated
electron carrier in the channel, whose area density is estimated to be
1.4x10^15 cm-2 (the average volume density of 1.7x10^21 cm-3), is the origin of
the high-Tc superconductivity. This result demonstrates that EDLTs are useful
tools to explore the ultimate Tc for insulating parent materials.

instabilities. In the relativistic regime typically the weibel instability
leading to the current separation dominates. The linear instability analysis is
carried out for a system wherein the transverse extent of the beam is infinite.
Even in simulations, infinite transverse extent of the beam has been chosen. In
real situations, however, beam width will always be finite. keeping this in
view the role of finite beam width on the evolution of the beam plasma system
has been studied here using Particle - in - Cell simulations. It is observed
that the current separation between the forward and return shielding current
for a beam with finite beam occurs at the scale length of the beam width
itself. Consequently the magnetic field structures that form have maximum power
at the scale length of the beam width. This behaviour is distinct from what
happens with a beam with having an infinite extent represented by simulations
in a periodic box, where the initial scale length at which the magnetic field
appears is that of the electron skin depth.

trajectories intermediate between laminar and turbulent states we can identify
the invariant object inside the laminar-turbulent boundary, the edge state. In
small domains, the flow behaves like a travelling wave over short time
intervals. On longer times one notes that the energy shows strong bursts at
regular time intervals. During the bursts the streak structure is lost, but it
reforms, translated in the spanwise direction by half the domain size. Varying
the suction velocity allows to embed the flow into a family of flows that
interpolate between plane Couette flow and the ASBL. Near the plane Couette
limit, the edge state is a travelling wave. Increasing the suction, the
travelling wave and a symmetry-related copy of it undergo a saddle-node
infinite-period (SNIPER) bifurcation that leads to bursting and
discrete-symmetry shifts. In wider domains, the structures localize in the
spanwise direction, and the flow in the active region is similar to the one in
small domains. There are still periodic bursts at which the flow structures are
shifted, but the shift-distance is no longer connected to a discrete symmetry
of the flow geometry. Two different states are found by edge tracking
techniques, one where structures are shifted to the same side at every burst
and one where they are alternatingly shifted to the left and to the right.

based on the conformal superspace description of conformal supergravity and
involves extending the supermanifold M^{4|8} by the tangent bundle of CP^1. The
resulting superspace M^{4|8} x TCP^1 can be identified in a certain gauge with
the conventional harmonic superspace M^{4|8} x S^2. This approach not only
makes the connection to projective superspace transparent, but simplifies
calculations in harmonic superspace significantly by eliminating the need to
deal directly with supergravity prepotentials. As an application of the
covariant approach, we derive from harmonic superspace the full component
action for the sigma model of a hyperkahler cone coupled to conformal
supergravity. Further applications are also sketched.

reionization as main targets of planned large radio interferometries (e.g.
Square Kilometre Array). Recently, it is claimed that the supersonic relative
velocity between baryons and cold dark matter can suppress the abundance of
first stars and impact the cosmological reionization process. Therefore, in
order to compare observed results with theoretical predictions it is important
to examine the effect of the supersonic relative motion on the small-scale
structure formation. In this paper, we investigate this effect on the nonlinear
structure formation in the context of the spherical collapse model in order to
understand the fundamental physics in a simple configuration. We show the
evolution of the dark matter sphere with the relative velocity by both using
N-body simulations and numerically calculating the equation of motion for the
dark matter mass shell. The effects of the relative motion in the spherical
collapse model appear as the delay of the collapse time of dark matter halos
and the decrease of the baryon mass fraction within the dark matter sphere.
Based on these results, we provide the fitting formula of the critical density
contrast for collapses with the relative motion effect and calculate the mass
function of dark matter halos in the Press-Schechter formalism. As a result,
the relative velocity decreases the abundance of dark matter halos whose mass
is smaller than $10^8~M_\odot/h$.

variances are known with an integer multiple structure. In this paper, we show
asymptotic validity of a slight modification of the original BIZ procedure as
the difference between the best alternative and the second best goes to

organisation in the structure of the network representing the interactions or
connections between the fundamental units of the studied system. Although a
number of notable methods are already available, their vast majority is
treating all directed acyclic graphs as already maximally hierarchical. Here we
propose a hierarchy measure based on random walks on the network. The novelty
of our approach is that directed trees corresponding to multi level pyramidal
structures obtain higher hierarchy scores compared to directed chains and
directed stars. Furthermore, in the thermodynamic limit the hierarchy measure
of regular trees is converging to a well defined limit depending only on the
branching number. When applied to real networks, our method is computationally
very effective, as the result can be evaluated with arbitrary precision by
subsequent multiplications of the transition matrix describing the random walk
process. In addition, the tests on real world networks provided very intuitive
results, e.g., the trophic levels obtained from our approach on a food web were
highly consistent with former results from ecology.

order to validate the existence of an Energy/Frequency Convexity Rule, which
relates energy consumption and microprocessor frequency for nanometer-scale
microprocessors. Data gathered during several month-long experimental
acquisition campaigns, supported by several independent publications, suggest
that energy consumed is indeed depending on the microprocessor's clock
frequency, and, more interestingly, the curve exhibits a clear minimum over the
processor's frequency range. An analytical model for this behavior is presented
and motivated, which fits well with the experimental data. A parameter
sensitivity analysis shows how parameters affect the energy minimum in the
clock frequency space. The conditions are discussed under which this convexity
rule can be exploited, and when other methods are more effective, with the aim
of improving the computer system's energy management efficiency. We show that
the power requirements of the computer system, besides the microprocessor, and
the overhead affect the location of the energy minimum the most. The
sensitivity analysis of the Energy/Frequency Convexity Rule puts forward a
number of simple guidelines especially for by low-power systems, such as
battery-powered and embedded systems, and less likely by high-performance
computer systems.

could be quickly lost as a result of gravitational-radiation-driven r-mode

suppressed due to a large bulk viscosity associated with the nonleptonic weak
interaction among quarks and thus most of its rotational energy could be
extracted to drive ASASSN-15lh. Therefore, we conclude that such an
ultra-energetic supernova provides a possible signature for the birth of a

the crossover of materials science and continuum mechanics. Developing a
continuum theory of dislocations requires the solution of two long standing
problems: (i) to represent dislocation kinematics in terms of a reasonable
number of variables and (ii) to derive averaged descriptions of the dislocation
dynamics (i.e. material laws) in terms of these variables. The kinematic
problem (i) was recently solved through the introduction of continuum
dislocation dynamics (CDD), which provides kinematically consistent evolution
equations of dislocation alignment tensors, presuming a given average
dislocation velocity (Hochrainer (2015), Philos. Mag. 95 (12), 1321--1367). In
the current paper we demonstrate how a free energy formulation may be used to
solve the dynamic closure problem (ii) in CDD. We do so exemplarily for the
lowest order CDD variant for curved dislocations in a single slip situation. In
this case, a thermodynamically consistent average dislocation velocity is found
to comprise five mesoscopic shear stress contributions. For a postulated free
energy expression we identify among these stress contributions a back-stress
term and a line-tension term, both of which have already been postulated for
CDD. A new stress contribution occurs which is missing in earlier CDD models
including the statistical continuum theory of straight parallel edge
dislocations (Groma et al. (2015), Acta Mater. 51, 1271-1281). Furthermore, two
entirely new stress contributions arise from the curvature of dislocations.

(HEP) community, designed for storing and analyzing petabytes of data in an
efficient way. Any instance of a C++ class can be stored into a ROOT file in a
machine-independent compressed binary format. In ROOT the TTree object
container is optimized for statistical data analysis over very large data sets
by using vertical data storage techniques. These containers can span a large
number of files on local disks, the web, or a number of different shared file
systems. In order to analyze this data, the user can chose out of a wide set of
mathematical and statistical functions, including linear algebra classes,
numerical algorithms such as integration and minimization, and various methods
for performing regression analysis (fitting). In particular, ROOT offers
packages for complex data modeling and fitting, as well as multivariate
classification based on machine learning techniques. A central piece in these
analysis tools are the histogram classes which provide binning of one- and
multi-dimensional data. Results can be saved in high-quality graphical formats
like Postscript and PDF or in bitmap formats like JPG or GIF. The result can
also be stored into ROOT macros that allow a full recreation and rework of the
graphics. Users typically create their analysis macros step by step, making use
of the interactive C++ interpreter CINT, while running over small data samples.
Once the development is finished, they can run these macros at full compiled
speed over large data sets, using on-the-fly compilation, or by creating a
stand-alone batch program. Finally, if processing farms are available, the user
can reduce the execution time of intrinsically parallel tasks - e.g. data
mining in HEP - by using PROOF, which will take care of optimally distributing
the work over the available resources in a transparent way.

Linton. Isbell showed in 1982 that the Lawvere-Linton algebraic theory of V can
be generated using a finite number of finitary operations, together with a
single operation of countably infinite arity. In 1983, Banaschewski and Rosicky
independently proved a conjecture of Bankston, establishing a strong negative
result on the axiomatisability of KH^op. In particular, V is not a finitary
variety--Isbell's result is best possible. The problem of axiomatising V by

First, we adapt the notion of contention resolution schemes of Chekuri,
Vondr\'ak, Zenklusen (SICOMP'14) to show that we can optimize non-negative
submodular functions in this setting with a constant factor loss with respect
to the deterministic setting. Second, we show a new contention resolution
scheme for transversal matroids, which yields better approximations in the
stochastic probing setting than the previously known tools. The rounding
procedure underlying the scheme can be of independent interest --- Bansal,

to delegate his quantum computation to a quantum server, while keeping the
input data, the algorithm and the result unknown to the server. In the studies
of practical BQC protocol, an important problem is how to reduce the quantum
requirement of the client. Multi-server BQC protocols have been proposed to
solve this problem. We review the double-server and triple-server protocols [Li
et al., Phys. Rev. A 89, 040302(R) (2014)], and propose a modified
double-server BQC protocol with a trusted center. In our protocol, the servers
are allowed to communicate mutually, and the client is completely classical.
Furthermore, our double-server protocol can be modified into a single-server
protocol by simply combining the two servers. Compared with the triple-server
protocol, our double-server and single-server protocols are more simple and the
client is not required to have the ability to access quantum channel. So our

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for high-dimensional partial differential

in many applications due to their distinctive features. However, they are often
deemed too costly because of the large number of degrees of freedom of the
approximation space, which are the main bottleneck for simulations in high
dimensions. In this paper, we develop sparse grid DG methods for elliptic
equations with the aim of breaking the \emph{curse of dimensionality}. Using a
hierarchical basis representation, we construct a sparse finite element
approximation space, reducing the degrees of freedom from the standard
{$O(h^{-d})$ to $O(h^{-1}|\log_2 h|^{d-1})$} for $d$-dimensional problems,
where $h$ is the uniform mesh size in each dimension. Our method, based on the
interior penalty (IP) DG framework, can achieve accuracy of $O(h^{k}|\log_2
h|^{d-1})$ in the energy norm, where $k$ is the degree of polynomials used.
Error estimates are provided and confirmed by numerical tests in

three polar-up sites. Additionally, the substitutional disorder of the
icosahedral carbon at all six polar sites, as previously discussed in the
literature, is also considered. Two configurational phase transitions from the
ordered to the disordered configurations are predicted to take place upon
increasing temperature using a mean-field approximation for the entropy. The
first transition, at 870 K, induces substitutional disorder of the icosahedral
carbon atoms among the three polar-up sites, meanwhile the second transition,
at 2325 K, reveals the random substitution of the icosahedral carbon atoms at
all six polar sites coexisting with bipolar defects. Already the first
transition removes the monoclinic distortion existing in the ordered ground
state configuration and restore the rhombohedral system (R3m). The restoration
of inversion symmetry yielding the full rhombohedral symmetry (R-3m) on
average, corresponding to what is reported in the literature, is achieved after
the second transition. The electronic density of states, obtained from the

potential via the highest occupied Kohn-Sham eigenvalue, we examine a variety
of exchange-correlation approximations: the local spin-density approximation,
semi-local generalized gradient approximations, and global and local hybrid
functionals. Results for a test set of 26 diatomic molecules and single atoms
are presented. We find that the aforementioned ensemble generalization
systematically improves the prediction of the ionization potential, for various

of total energy-related properties. We specifically examine hybrid functionals.
These depend on a parameter controlling the ratio of semi-local to non-local

ensemble-generalized functionals is found to depend only weakly on the

Accepted in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv2024",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-mass planets are known to undergo Type I migration and this process must
have played a key role during the evolution of planetary systems. Analytical
formulae for the disc torque have been derived assuming that the planet evolves
on a fixed circular orbit. However, recent work has shown that in isothermal
discs, a migrating protoplanet may also experience dynamical corotation torques
that scale with the planet drift rate. The aim of this study is to examine
whether dynamical corotation torques can also affect the migration of low-mass
planets in non-isothermal discs. We performed 2D radiative hydrodynamical
simulations to examine the orbital evolution outcome of migrating protoplanets
as a function of disc mass. We find that a protoplanet can enter a fast
migration regime when it migrates in the direction set by the entropy-related
horseshoe drag and when the Toomre stability parameter is less than a threshold
value below which the horseshoe region contracts into a tadpole-like region. In
that case, an underdense trapped region appears near the planet, with an
entropy excess compared to the ambient disc. If the viscosity and thermal
diffusivity are small enough so that the entropy excess is conserved during
migration, the planet then experiences strong corotation torques arising from
the material flowing across the planet orbit. During fast migration, we observe
that a protoplanet can pass through the zero-torque line predicted by static

[Method] Alpha particles were detected in coincidence with evaporation residues
(ER) formed by the fusion of 18O and 12C nuclei. Both alpha particles and ERs
were identified on the basis of their energy and time-of-flight. ERs were
characterized by their energy spectra and angular distributions while the alpha
particles were characterized by their energy spectra, angular distributions,
and cross-sections. [Results] While the energy spectra and angular
distributions for the alpha particles are well reproduced by statistical model
codes, the measured cross-section is substantially underpredicted by the

for the alpha cross-section is Ec.m. and not the excitation energy of the fused

compared to the statistical model codes and its dependence with Ec.m. suggest
that a coupling between pre-existing alpha cluster structure and the collision
dynamics is responsible for the observed alpha cross-section.

framework for modelling biological systems. The steady-state dynamics of PBNs
is of special interest in the analysis of biological systems. However,
obtaining the steady-state distributions for such systems poses a significant
challenge due to the state space explosion problem which often arises in the
case of large PBNs. The only viable way is to use statistical methods. We have
considered the two-state Markov chain approach and the Skart method for the
analysis of large PBNs in our previous work. However, the sample size required
in both methods is often huge in the case of large PBNs and generating them is
expensive in terms of computation time. Parallelising the sample generation is
an ideal way to solve this issue. In this paper, we consider combining the
German & Rubin method with either the two-state Markov chain approach or the
Skart method for parallelisation. The first method can be used to run multiple
independent Markov chains in parallel and to control their convergence to the
steady-state while the other two methods can be used to determine the sample
size required for computing the steady-state probability of states of interest.
Experimental results show that our proposed combinations can reduce time cost
of computing stead-state probabilities of large PBNs significantly.

coupled oscillators offer an open challenge to researchers as the cessation of
oscillation often leads to a fatal system degradation and an irrecoverable
malfunctioning in many physical, biological and physiological systems. Recently
a general technique of restoration of rhythmicity in diffusively coupled
networks of nonlinear oscillators has been proposed in [Zou et al. Nature
Commun. 6:7709, 2015], where it is shown that a proper feedback parameter that
controls the rate of diffusion can effectively revive oscillation from an
oscillation suppressed state. In this paper we show that the mean-field
diffusive coupling, which can suppress oscillation even in a network of
identical oscillators, can be modified in order to revoke the cessation of
oscillation induced by it. Using a rigorous bifurcation analysis we show that,
unlike other diffusive coupling schemes, here one has {\it two control
parameters}, namely the {\it density of the mean-field} and the {\it feedback
parameter} that can be controlled to revive oscillation from a death state. We
demonstrate that an appropriate choice of density of the mean-field is capable
of inducing rhythmicity even in the presence of complete diffusion, which is an
unique feature of this mean-field coupling that is not available in other
coupling schemes. Finally, we report the {\it first} experimental observation
of revival of oscillation from the mean-field--induced oscillation suppression
state that supports our theoretical results.

us to design a distributed database system to manage it. For distributed RDF
data design, it is quite common to partition the RDF data into some parts,
called fragments, which are then distributed. Thus, the distribution design
consists of two steps: fragmentation and allocation. In this paper, we propose
a method to explore the intrinsic similarities among the structures of queries
in a workload for fragmentation and allocation, which aims to reduce the number
of crossing matches and the communication cost during SPARQL query processing.
Specifically, we mine and select some frequent access patterns to reflect the
characteristics of the workload. Here, although we prove that selecting the
optimal set of frequent access patterns is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic
algorithm which guarantees both the data integrity and the approximation ratio.
Based on the selected frequent access patterns, we propose two fragmentation
strategies, vertical and horizontal fragmentation strategies, to divide RDF
graphs while meeting different kinds of query processing objectives. Vertical
fragmentation is for better throughput and horizontal fragmentation is for
better performance. After fragmentation, we discuss how to allocate these
fragments to various sites. Finally, we discuss how to process a query based on
the results of fragmentation and allocation. Extensive experiments confirm the
superior performance of our proposed solutions.

angles of sunspot groups. The sunspot sizes in Schwabe's drawings are not to
scale and need to be converted into physical sunspot areas. We employed a
statistical approach assuming that the area distribution of sunspots was the
same in the 19th century as it was in the 20th century. Umbral areas for about
130,000 sunspots observed by Schwabe were obtained, as well as the tilt angles
of sunspot groups assuming them to be bipolar. There is, of course, no polarity
information in the observations. The annually averaged sunspot areas correlate
reasonably with sunspot number. We derived an average tilt angle by attempting
to exclude unipolar groups with a minimum separation of the two alleged
polarities and an outlier rejection method which follows the evolution of each
group and detects the moment it turns unipolar at its decay. As a result, the
tilt angles, although displaying considerable scatter, place the leading
polarity on average 5.85+-0.25 closer to the equator, in good agreement with
tilt angles obtained from 20th-century data sets. Sources of uncertainties in
the tilt angle determination are discussed and need to be addressed whenever
different data sets are combined. The sunspot area and tilt angle data are

partial distributed observation. We employ a least-squares technique and
minimize the $L^2$-norm of the distance from the observation to any solution.
Taking the parabolic equation as the main constraint of the problem, the
optimality conditions are reduced to a mixed formulation involving both the
state to reconstruct and a Lagrange multiplier. The well-posedness of this
mixed formulation - in particular the inf-sup property - is a consequence of
classical energy estimates. We then reproduce the arguments to a linear first
order system, involving the normal flux, equivalent to the linear parabolic
equation. The method, valid in any dimension spatial dimension $N$, may also be
employed to reconstruct solution for boundary observations.
  With respect to the hyperbolic situation considered in

requires - due to regularization properties - the introduction of appropriate

projection of multiple patterns results in their superposition in the

the winning effect depends strongly on the intensity of the magnetic field. The
inverse magnetic catalysis at zero chemical potential has two distinct effects
for magnetic fields above $\gtrsim 0.3$ GeV$^2$: it shifts the CEP to lower
chemical potentials, hinders the increase of the CEP temperature and prevents a
too large increase of the baryonic density at the CEP. For fields $eB<0.1$
GeV$^2$ the competing effects between the vector contribution and the magnetic
field can move the CEP to regions of temperature and density in the phase

online platforms - Twitter and location-based social network Foursquare - we
represent the two together as a composite multilayer online social network.
Through this paradigm we study the interactions of pairs of users
differentiating between those with links on one or both networks. We find that
users with multiplex links, who are connected on both networks, interact more
and have greater neighbourhood overlap on both platforms, in comparison with
pairs who are connected on just one of the social networks. In particular, the
most frequented locations of users are considerably closer, and similarity is
considerably greater among multiplex links. We present a number of structural
and interaction features, such as the multilayer Adamic/Adar coefficient, which
are based on the extension of the concept of the node neighbourhood beyond the
single network. Our evaluation, which aims to shed light on the implications of
multiplexity for the link generation process, shows that multilayer features,
constructed from properties across social networks, perform better than their
single network counterparts in predicting links across networks. We propose
that combining information from multiple networks in a multilayer configuration

can significantly improve link prediction overall with valuable applications to

modeling has involved simply assuming that alkali elements such as potassium
occur as gas-phase atoms and are collisionally ionized following the Saha
equation. We show that the Saha equation often does not hold, because free
charges are produced by thermionic and ion emission and destroyed when they
stick to grain surfaces. This means the ionization state depends not on the
first ionization potential of the alkali atoms, but rather on the grains' work
functions. The charged species' abundances typically rise abruptly above about
800 K, with little qualitative dependence on the work function, gas density, or
dust-to-gas mass ratio. Applying our results, we find that protoplanetary
disks' dead zone, where high diffusivities stifle magnetorotational turbulence,
has its inner edge located where the temperature exceeds a threshold value
~1000 K. The threshold is set by ambipolar diffusion except at the highest
densities, where it is set by Ohmic resistivity. We find that the disk gas can

basis of red mid-infrared-to-optical and optical-to-near-infrared colours, with
the intention of identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dust enshrouded

emission line features and to search for broad components in the

MIR diagnostics, and SED fitting have also been employed to study the nature of
the sources. We successfully identified three objects for which we had only a
photometric redshift estimate. Based on their emission line diagnostics and on
ancillary multi-wavelength constraints, we find that all four targets harbor
obscured AGNs. Broad profiles that could be attributed to the effects of
outflows are revealed in only one target, MIRO20581. In particular, we clearly
resolved a fast ($\sim$1600 km/s) and extended ($\sim$5 kpc) outflow in the
[OIII]5007 emission line. This feature, the commonly used indicator for ionised
outflowing gas, was sampled and detected only for this target; hence, we can
not exclude the presence of outflows in the other sources. Overall, the
constraints we obtain from our targets and from other comparative samples from
the literature suggest that these optically faint luminous infrared galaxies,
hosting obscured AGNs, may represent a brief evolutionary phase between the
post-merger starburst and the unobscured QSO phases.

and angular momentum by hyper-accretion immediately following their formation.
We here describe a general framework of extended emission in gravitational
waves from non-axisymmetric accretion flows from fallback matter of the
progenitor envelope. It shows (a) a maximum efficiency in conversion of
accretion energy into gravitational waves at hyper-accretion rates exceeding a
critical value set by the ratio of the quadrupole mass inhomogeneity and
viscosity with (b) a peak characteristic strain amplitude at the frequency
$f_b=\Omega_b/\pi$, where $\Omega_b$ is the Keplerian angular velocity at which
viscous torques equal angular momentum loss in gravitational radiation, with
$h_{char}\propto f^{1/6}$ at $f<f_b$ and $h_{char}\propto f^{-1/6}$ at $f>f_b$.
Upcoming gravitational wave observations may probe this scaling by extracting
broadband spectra using time-sliced matched filtering with chirp templates,
recently developed for identifying turbulence in noisy time series.

present work, we find very similar shapes in our molecular dynamics simulations
of the nuclear pasta phases of dense nuclear matter that are expected deep in
the crust of neutron stars. There are dramatic differences between nuclear
pasta and terrestrial cell biology. Nuclear pasta is 14 orders of magnitude
denser than the aqueous environs of the cell nucleus and involves strong
interactions between protons and neutrons, while cellular scale biology is
dominated by the entropy of water and complex assemblies of biomolecules.
Nonetheless the very similar geometry suggests both systems may have similar
coarse-grained dynamics and that the shapes are indeed determined by
geometrical considerations, independent of microscopic details. Many of our
simulations self-assemble into flat sheets connected by helical ramps. These
ramps may impact the thermal and electrical conductivities, viscosity, shear
modulus, and breaking strain of neutron star crust. The interaction we use,
with Coulomb frustration, may provide a simple model system that reproduces
many biologically important shapes.

indistinguishability with respect to all observables, of models attributing
radically different radii to space -- larger than the observable universe, or
far smaller than the Planck length, say. Two interpretational branch points are
identified and discussed. First, whether duals are physically equivalent or
not: by considering a duality of the familiar simple harmonic oscillator, I
argue that they are. Unlike the oscillator, there are no measurements 'outside'
string theory that could distinguish the duals. Second, whether duals agree or
disagree on the radius of 'target space', the space in which strings evolve
according to string theory. I argue for the latter position, because the
alternative leaves it unknown what the radius is. Since duals are physically
equivalent yet disagree on the radius of target space, it follows that the
radius is indeterminate between them. Using an analysis of Brandenberger and
Vafa (1989), I explain why -- even so -- space is observed to have a
determinate, large radius. The conclusion is that observed, 'phenomenal' space
is not target space, since a space cannot have both a determinate and
indeterminate radius: instead phenomenal space must be a higher-level
phenomenon, not fundamental.
