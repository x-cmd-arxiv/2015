of a simple hopping theory. We start by studying the low energy spectrum of
parent Hamiltonians of injective Matrix Product States in a particular long
range and system size limit under the validity of an asymptotic regime with low
particle density. We show that in this limit a natural first quantization
arises. This allows us to compute a specific type of low energy spectrum. This
spectrum depends solely on the properties of a quantum channel, i.e. transfer
matrix of the ground state, and not on any other details of the ground-state.
We also review normal quantum channels for which the expression is more
simplified. The construction possibly has some interesting uses for the study
of quantum and classical Markov processes which we briefly expose. As an
application, we revisit the notion of (many-body)-localization with our
framework. Our calculations revealed that translational invariant Matrix
Product States can be interpreted as a stationary sea of particles. As a next
step rather than starting from some local Hamiltonian with random potentials,
we consider fluctuations of the local tensors of a continuous one-parameter
family of Matrix Product States. Localization in 1-dimension, is then
understood from a simple study of spectral and mixing properties of finite
dimensional quantum channels.

the growing need to directly compare results from different observatories pose

we have designed and implemented a modular analysis framework based on the
method of maximum likelihood. The framework facilitates the calculation of a
binned Poisson Log-likelihood value for a given physics model (i.e., source
model), data set, and detector response. The parameters of the physics model
(sky position, spectrum, angular extent, etc.) can be optimized through a
likelihood maximization routine to obtain a best match to the data. In a
similar way, the parameters of the detector response (absolute pointing,
angular resolution, etc.) can be optimized using a well-known source such as
the Crab Nebula. The framework was designed concurrently with the Multi-Mission
Maximum Likelihood (3ML) architecture, and allows for the definition of a
general collection of sources with individually varying spectral and spatial
morphologies. Compatibility with the 3ML architecture allows to easily perform
powerful joint fits with other observatories. In this contribution, we overview

promise to be used as an alternative two-dimensional material to graphene and
transition metal dichalcogenides especially as an anode material for
lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, at present bulk black phosphorus (BP)
still suffers from rapid capacity fading that results in poor rechargeable
performance. Here, for the first time, we use in situ transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) to construct nanoscale phosphorene LIBs and visualize the
capacity fading mechanism in thick multilayer phosphorene by real time
capturing delithiation-induced structural decomposition that reduces electrical
conductivity and thus causes irreversibility of lithiated Li3P phase. We
further demonstrate that few-layer phosphorene successfully circumvents the
structural decomposition and holds superior structural restorability, even
subjected to multi-cycle lithiation/delithiation processes and concomitant huge
volume expansion. This finding affords new experimental insights into
thickness-dependent lithium diffusion kinetics in phosphorene. Additionally, a
scalable liquid-phase shear exfoliation route has been developed to produce
high-quality ultrathin (monolayer or few-layer) phosphorene, only by a
high-speed shear mixer or even a household kitchen blender with the shear rate
threshold, which will pave the way for potential large-scale applications in
LIBs once the rechargeable phosphorene nanoscale batteries can be transferred

large inner gap known to harbor detectable quantities of warm (T=450 K) water

rotational emission lines of water vapor from this source, and use the shapes
of the emission lines to constrain the location of the water vapor. We find
that the emission originates near 0.3 AU --- the inner disk region. This
characteristic region coincides with that inferred for both optically thick and
thin thermal infrared dust emission, as well as rovibrational CO emission. The
presence of water in the dust-depleted region implies substantial columns of
hydrogen (>10^{22} cm-2) as the water vapor would otherwise be destroyed by
photodissociation. Combined with the dust modeling, this column implies a
gas/small-dust ratio in the optically thin dusty region of >1000. These results

Newtonian gravity in conjunction with observable galactic matter. To account
for the phenomenon, some researchers modified Newtonian gravitation; others
introduced dark matter in the context of Newtonian gravity. We employed general
relativity successfully to describe the galactic velocity profiles of four
galaxies: NGC 2403, NGC 2903, NGC 5055 and the Milky Way. Here we map the
density contours of the galaxies, achieving good concordance with observational
data. In our Solar neighbourhood, we found a mass density and density fall-off
fitting observational data satisfactorily. From our GR results, using the
threshold density related to the observed optical zone of a galaxy, we had
found that the Milky Way was indicated to be considerably larger than had been
believed to be the case. To our knowledge, this was the only such existing
theoretical prediction ever presented. Very recent observational results by Xu
et al. have confirmed our prediction. As in our previous studies, galactic
masses are consistently seen to be higher than the baryonic mass determined
from observations but still notably lower than those deduced from the
approaches relying upon dark matter in a Newtonian context. In this work, we
calculate the non-luminous fraction of matter for our sample of galaxies that
is derived from applying general relativity to the dynamics of the galaxies.
The evidence points to general relativity playing a key role in the explanation
of the stars' high velocities in galaxies. Mapping galactic density contours
directly from the dynamics opens a new window for predicting galactic

measured near-infrared reflectance spectra of ordinary (H, L and LL) chondrites
from the study of Dunn et al. (2010), which we resampled to the NIRS wavelength
range. Using spectral parameters extracted from these resampled spectra we
established a relationship between band parameters and their mafic silicate
composition (olivine and low-Ca pyroxene). We found a correlation >90% between
mafic silicate composition (fayalite and forsterite mol. %) estimated by our
spectral method and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measured values. To test the
validity of the newly derived equations we blind tested them using nine
laboratory-measured spectra of L and LL type chondrites with known composition.
We found that the absolute difference between the measured and computed values

calibration is robust and can be applied to Hayabusa NIRS data despite its
limited spectral range. We applied the derived equations to a subset of

  Exogenous Variables",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vector autoregression (VAR) has long proven to be an effective method for
modeling the joint dynamics of macroeconomic time series as well as
forecasting. A major shortcoming of the VAR that has hindered its applicability
is its heavy parameterization: the parameter space grows quadratically with the
number of series included, quickly exhausting the available degrees of freedom.
Consequently, forecasting using VARs is intractable for low-frequency,
high-dimensional macroeconomic data. However, empirical evidence suggests that
VARs that incorporate more component series tend to result in more accurate
forecasts. Conventional methods that allow for the estimation of large VARs
either tend to require ad hoc subjective specifications or are computationally
infeasible. Moreover, as global economies become more intricately intertwined,
there has been substantial interest in incorporating the impact of stochastic,
unmodeled exogenous variables. Vector autoregression with exogenous variables
(VARX) extends the VAR to allow for the inclusion of unmodeled variables, but
it similarly faces dimensionality challenges.
  We introduce the VARX-L framework, a structured family of VARX models, and
provide methodology that allows for both efficient estimation and accurate
forecasting in high-dimensional analysis. VARX-L adapts several prominent
scalar regression regularization techniques to a vector time series context in
order to greatly reduce the parameter space of VAR and VARX models. We also
highlight a compelling extension that allows for shrinking toward reference
models, such as a vector random walk. We demonstrate the efficacy of VARX-L in
both low- and high-dimensional macroeconomic forecasting applications and
simulated data examples. Our methodology is easily reproducible in a publicly
available R package.

proportion of stems larger than approximately 20 cm diameter at breast height
for 22 tree taxa, generally at the genus level. The data come from
settlement-era public survey records that are transcribed and then aggregated
spatially, giving count data. The domain is divided into two regions, eastern
(Maine to Ohio) and midwestern (Indiana to Minnesota). Public Land Survey point
data in the midwestern region (ca. 0.8-km resolution) are aggregated to a
regular 8 km grid, while data in the eastern region, from Town Proprietor
Surveys, are aggregated at the township level in irregularly-shaped local
administrative units. The product is based on a Bayesian statistical model fit
to the count data that estimates composition on a regular 8 km grid across the
entire domain. The statistical model is designed to handle data from both the
regular grid and the irregularly-shaped townships and allows us to estimate
composition at locations with no data and to smooth over noise caused by
limited counts in locations with data. The model also allows us to quantify
uncertainty in our composition estimates, making the product suitable for
applications employing data assimilation. We expect this data product to be

latent health state from longitudinal clinical measurements. Model development
is motivated by the need to integrate multiple sources of data to improve
clinical decisions about whether to remove or irradiate a patient's prostate
cancer. Existing modeling approaches are extended to accommodate measurement
error in cancer state determinations based on biopsied tissue, clinical
measurements possibly not missing at random, and informative partial
observation of the true state. The proposed model enables estimation of whether
an individual's underlying prostate cancer is aggressive, requiring surgery
and/or radiation, or indolent, permitting continued surveillance. These
individualized predictions can then be communicated to clinicians and patients
to inform decision-making. We demonstrate the model with data from a cohort of
low risk prostate cancer patients at Johns Hopkins University and assess
predictive accuracy among a subset for whom true cancer state is observed.
Simulation studies confirm model performance and explore the impact of
adjusting for informative missingness on true state predictions. R code and

Poisson processes, is considered. The system is heterogeneous in that the
servers also can be of multiple types. Each customer has an independent
exponentially distributed service time, with the mean determined by its type.
Multiple customers (possibly of different types) can be placed for service into
one server, subject to ""packing"" constraints, which depend on the server type.
Service times of different customers are independent, even if served
simultaneously by the same server. The large-scale asymptotic regime is
considered such that the customer arrival rates grow to infinity.
  We consider two variants of the model. For the {\em infinite-server} model,
we prove asymptotic optimality of the {\em Greedy Random} (GRAND) algorithm in
the sense of minimizing the weighted (by type) number of occupied servers in
steady-state. (This version of GRAND generalizes that introduced in [15] for
the homogeneous systems, with all servers of same type.) We then introduce a
natural extension of GRAND algorithm for {\em finite-server} systems with
blocking. Assuming subcritical system load, we prove existence, uniqueness, and
local stability of the large-scale system equilibrium point such that no
blocking occurs. This result strongly suggests a conjecture that the
steady-state blocking probability under the algorithm vanishes in the
large-scale limit.

relaxation frequency is determined via the threshold of the parametric
instability measured by Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy. The
application of a dc current to the Pt film leads to the formation of a

applied dc current with respect to the magnetization direction, the damping can
be increased or decreased. The magnitude of its variation is proportional to
the applied current. A variation in the relaxation frequency of +/-7.5% is

  Two-Sample Tests","Major updates. New results and simulations added. 54 pages, 8 figures",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Testing equality of two multivariate distributions is a classical problem for
which many non-parametric tests have been proposed over the years. Most of the
popular two-sample tests, which are asymptotically distribution-free, are based
either on geometric graphs constructed using inter-point distances between the
observations (multivariate generalizations of the Wald-Wolfowitz's runs test)
or on multivariate data-depth (generalizations of the Mann-Whitney rank test).
  This paper introduces a general notion of distribution-free graph-based
two-sample tests, and provides a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
their asymptotic properties. The asymptotic (Pitman) efficiency of a general
graph-based test is derived, which include tests based on geometric graphs,
such as the Friedman-Rafsky test (1979), the test based on the $K$-nearest
neighbor graph, the cross-match test (2005), the generalized edge-count test
(2017), as well as tests based on multivariate depth functions (the Liu-Singh
rank sum statistic (1993)). The results show how the combinatorial properties
of the underlying graph effect the performance of the associated two-sample
test, and can be used to validate and decide which tests to use in practice.
Applications of the results are illustrated both on synthetic and real
datasets.

decomposed as a sum of nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers, where the Fibonacci
numbers satisfy $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for $n\geq 3$, $F_1=1$ and $F_2=2$. The
distribution of the number of summands in such decomposition converges to a
Gaussian, the gaps between summands converges to geometric decay, and the
distribution of the longest gap is similar to that of the longest run of heads
in a biased coin; these results also hold more generally, though for technical
reasons previous work needed to assume the coefficients in the recurrence
relation are non-negative and the first term is positive.
  We extend these results by creating an infinite family of integer sequences
called the $m$-gonal sequences arising from a geometric construction using
circumscribed $m$-gons. They satisfy a recurrence where the first $m+1$ leading
terms vanish, and thus cannot be handled by existing techniques. We provide a
notion of a legal decomposition, and prove that the decompositions exist and
are unique. We then examine the distribution of the number of summands used in
the decompositions and prove that it displays Gaussian behavior. There is
geometric decay in the distribution of gaps, both for gaps taken from all
integers in an interval and almost surely in distribution for the individual
gap measures associated to each integer in the interval. We end by proving that
the distribution of the longest gap between summands is strongly concentrated
about its mean, behaving similarly as in the longest run of heads in tosses of
a coin.

operators evaluated over annotated relations. We show that straightforward
extensions of standard multiway join algorithms and generalized hypertree

work uses bespoke algorithms and data structures and does not match these
guarantees. Our extensions to the standard techniques are a pair of simple
tests that (1) determine if two orderings of aggregation operators are
equivalent and (2) determine if a GHD is compatible with a given ordering.
These tests provide a means to find an optimal GHD that, when provided to
standard join algorithms, will correctly answer a given aggregate-join query.
The second class of our contributions is a pair of complete characterizations
of (1) the set of orderings equivalent to a given ordering and (2) the set of
GHDs compatible with some equivalent ordering. We show by example that previous
approaches are incomplete. The key technical consequence of our
characterizations is a decomposition of a compatible GHD into a set of
(smaller) {\em unconstrained} GHDs, i.e. into a set of GHDs of sub-queries
without aggregations. Since this decomposition is comprised of unconstrained
GHDs, we are able to connect to the wide literature on GHDs for join query
processing, thereby obtaining improved runtime bounds, MapReduce variants, and
an efficient method to find approximately optimal GHDs.

estimating high density regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class
Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating
such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical
limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor
performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution
of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it
hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to
estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter
controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is
learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by
adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on
different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced
by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the
hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental
results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while
suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates.
Results on actual data sets are also presented.

calculated using the known analytical expression for narrow resonances. In

interacting many-electron systems at half-filling on a periodic hyper-cubic
lattice, the free energy density uniformly converges to an analytic function of
the coupling constants in the infinite-volume, zero-temperature limit if the
external magnetic field has a chessboard-like flux configuration. The spatial
dimension is allowed to be any number larger than 1. The system covers the
Hubbard model with a nearest-neighbor hopping term, on-site interactions,
exponentially decaying density-density interactions and exponentially decaying
spin-spin interactions. The magnetic field must be included in the kinetic term
by the Peierls substitution. The flux configuration and the sign of the
nearest-neighbor density-density/spin-spin interactions can be adjusted so that
the free energy density is minimum among all the flux configurations.
Consequently, the minimum free energy density is proved to converge to an
analytic function of the coupling constants in the infinite-volume,
zero-temperature limit. These are extension of the results on a square lattice

BESIII detector operated at the BEPCII collider, we measure the absolute decay
branching fractions to be $\mathcal B(D^0 \to K^-e^+\nu_e)=(3.505\pm 0.014 \pm
0.033)\%$ and $\mathcal B(D^0 \to \pi^-e^+\nu_e)=(0.295\pm 0.004\pm 0.003)\%$.
From a study of the differential decay rates we obtain the products of hadronic
form factor and the magnitude of the CKM matrix element
$f_{+}^K(0)|V_{cs}|=0.7172\pm0.0025\pm 0.0035$ and
$f_{+}^{\pi}(0)|V_{cd}|=0.1435\pm0.0018\pm 0.0009$. Combining these products
with the values of $|V_{cs(d)}|$ from the SM constraint fit, we extract the
hadronic form factors $f^K_+(0) = 0.7368\pm0.0026\pm 0.0036$ and $f^\pi_+(0) =
0.6372\pm0.0080\pm 0.0044$, and their ratio $f_+^{\pi}(0)/f_+^{K}(0)=0.8649\pm
0.0112\pm 0.0073$. These form factors and their ratio are used to test
unquenched Lattice QCD calculations of the form factors and a light cone sum
rule (LCSR) calculation of their ratio. The measured value of $f_+^{K(\pi)}(0)
|V_{cs(d)}|$ and the lattice QCD value for $f^{K(\pi)}_+(0)$ are used to
extract values of the CKM matrix elements of $|V_{cs}|=0.9601 \pm 0.0033 \pm
0.0047 \pm 0.0239$ and $|V_{cd}|=0.2155 \pm 0.0027 \pm 0.0014 \pm 0.0094$,
where the third errors are due to the uncertainties in lattice QCD calculations
of the form factors. Using the LCSR value for $f_+^\pi(0)/f_+^K(0)$, we
determine the ratio $|V_{cd}|/|V_{cs}|=0.238\pm 0.004\pm 0.002\pm 0.011$, where
the third error is from the uncertainty in the LCSR normalization. In addition,
we measure form factor parameters for three different theoretical models that
describe the weak hadronic charged currents for these two semileptonic decays.
All of these measurements are the most precise to date.

(UDOOC) that is formed by inserting a ""comma"" indicator, termed the unique word
(UW), between consecutive one-to-one codewords for separation. Along this
research direction, we first investigate several general combinatorial
properties of UDOOCs, in particular the enumeration of the number of UDOOC
codewords for any (finite) codeword length. Based on the obtained formula on
the number of length-n codewords for a given UW, the per-letter average
codeword length of UDOOC for the optimal compression of a given source
statistics can be computed. Several upper bounds on the average codeword length
of such UDOOCs are next established. The analysis on the bounds of average
codeword length then leads to two asymptotic bounds for sources having
infinitely many alphabets, one of which is achievable and hence tight for a
certain source statistics and UW, and the other of which proves the
achievability of source entropy rate of UDOOCs when both the block size of
source letters for UDOOC compression and UW length go to infinity. Efficient
encoding and decoding algorithms for UDOOCs are also given in this paper.
Numerical results show that the proposed UDOOCs can potentially result in
comparable compression rate to the Huffman code under similar decoding
complexity and yield a smaller average codeword length than that of the
Lempel-Ziv code, thereby confirming the practicability of UDOOCs.

in slope of the exchange-correlation (xc) energy as a function of electron
number, expected across an integer-electron point. Popular approximate
functionals are thought to be devoid of a derivative discontinuity, strongly
compromising their performance for prediction of spectroscopic properties. Here
we show that, in fact, all exchange-correlation functionals possess a
derivative discontinuity, which arises naturally from the application of
ensemble considerations within DFT, without any empiricism. This derivative
discontinuity can be expressed in closed form using only quantities obtained in
the course of a standard DFT calculation of the neutral system. For small,
finite systems, addition of this derivative discontinuity indeed results in a
greatly improved prediction for the fundamental gap, even when based on the
most simple approximate exchange-correlation density functional - the local
density approximation (LDA). For solids, the same scheme is exact in principle,
but when applied to LDA it results in a vanishing derivative discontinuity
correction. This failure is shown to be directly related to the failure of LDA
in predicting fundamental gaps from total energy differences in extended
systems.

Often trying to observe physics underlying the hard interactions at colliders
requires experimental cuts in phase space, defining several jet or beam
regions. QCD being a gauge theory that readily decays into infra-red modes,
correlations between jet regions is almost inevitable, spoiling the
predictivity of fixed order QCD calculations. One is faced with the task of
calculating the evolution of a reduced density matrix, where successively less
energetic (jet) regions are integrated out, to gain control of the calculation.
I relate the decay rates governing the flow into the IR to an effective field
theory expansion in soft jets, allowing a systematic and resummed calculation
of these rates, while further relating them to physically observable features
of the QCD cascade. To demonstrate the utility of the soft jet expansion, I
present a factorization theorem for a soft subjet collinearly splitting in and
out of a parent fat jet. Using the resummation properties of this factorization
theorem, I elucidate the structure of the subleading non-global logs (encoding
the jet correlations) in the hemisphere jet mass distribution, as well as give
a collinear improvement of the leading order resummation equation, the BMS
equation. I compare to other approaches to subleading resummation of NGLs, and
find the collinear improvement of the leading order equation removes the need
for kinematic-dependent corrections in the IR averaging procedure of the
reduced density matrix, so that no further large logs can be generated in the
IR. Finally I end with speculation about connections with collinear
improvements of the NLO B-JIMWLK hierarchy for small-$x$ resummation.

Analyzing and processing point cloud surfaces is important in computer graphics
and computer vision. However, most of the existing algorithms for surface
analysis require connectivity information. Therefore, it is desirable to
develop a mesh structure on point clouds. This task can be simplified with the
aid of a parameterization. In particular, conformal parameterizations are
advantageous in preserving the geometric information of the point cloud data.
In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art spherical conformal
parameterization algorithm for genus-0 closed meshes to the case of point
clouds, using an improved approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on
data points. Then, we propose an iterative scheme called the North-South
reiteration for achieving a spherical conformal parameterization. A balancing
scheme is introduced to enhance the distribution of the spherical
parameterization. High quality triangulations and quadrangulations can then be
built on the point clouds with the aid of the parameterizations. Also, the
meshes generated are guaranteed to be genus-0 closed meshes. Moreover, using
our proposed spherical conformal parameterization, multilevel representations
of point clouds can be easily constructed. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

inter-particle long range interactions that decay with distance like 1/r^alpha,
for alpha>=0. We demonstrate that although such systems are generally
characterized by strong chaos, they exhibit an unexpectedly organized behavior
when the exponent alpha<1. This is shown by computing dynamical quantities such
as the maximal Lyapunov exponent, which decreases as the number of degrees of
freedom increases. We also discuss our numerical methods of symplectic
integration implemented for the solution of the equations of motion together
with their associated variational equations. The validity of our numerical
simulations is estimated by showing that the total energy of the system is
conserved within an accuracy of 4 digits (with integration step tau=0.02), even
for as many as N=8000 particles and integration times as long as 10^6 units.

  in Nakagami-$m$ Channels","To be presented at IEEE GLOBECOM 2015",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy harvesting (EH) cognitive relays are an exciting solution to the
problem of inefficient use of spectrum while achieving green communications and
spatial diversity. In a spectrum sharing scenario, we investigate the
performance of a cognitive relay network, where a secondary source communicates
with its destination over Nakagami-$m$ channels via decode-and-forward EH
relays while maintaining the outage probability of the primary user below a
predefined threshold. Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression for the
secondary outage probability and show that it is a function of the probability
of an EH relay having sufficient energy for relaying, which in turn, depends on
the energy harvesting and consumption rates of the EH relay and the primary
outage probability threshold. We also show that relaxing the primary outage
constraint may not always benefit the cognitive EH relay network due to the
limitations imposed on the relay's transmit power by the energy constraint.

retrieval code custom built for extrasolar atmospheres. In Waldmann et al.
(2015) the transmission spectroscopic case was introduced, here we present the
emission spectroscopy spectral retrieval for the Tau-REx framework. Compared to
transmission spectroscopy, the emission case is often significantly more
degenerate due to the need to retrieve the full atmospheric
temperature-pressure (TP) profile. This is particularly true in the case of
current measurements of exoplanetary atmospheres, which are either of low
signal-to-noise, low spectral resolution or both. Here we present a new way of
combining two existing approaches to the modelling of the said TP profile: 1)
the parametric profile, where the atmospheric TP structure is analytically
approximated by a few model parameters, 2) the Layer-by-Layer approach, where
individual atmospheric layers are modelled. Both these approaches have distinct
advantages and disadvantages in terms of convergence properties and potential
model biases. The Tau-REx hybrid model presented here is a new two-stage TP
profile retrieval, which combines the robustness of the analytic solution with
the accuracy of the Layer-by-Layer approach. The retrieval process is
demonstrated using simulations of the hot-Jupiter WASP-76b and the hot
SuperEarth 55 Cnc e, as well as on the secondary eclipse measurements of
HD189733b.

MOND and the gravitational lensing attributed to the dark matter halo. It also
naturally accommodates the observed value of the cosmological constant. We show
that it predicts a few percent deviation for the post Newtonian parameter
$\gamma$ in a part of the regime that interpolates the Newtonian regime to the
MOND regime. The deviation is consistent with the reported observations but can
possibly be detected by fine-tuned refinements of the current data or specified
future observations.

case and the three distinct eigenvalues are $-a,0,a$. For the case $a^2>3$, we
establish the universal behavior of local eigenvalue correlations in the limit
$n\rightarrow \infty$, which is known from unitarily invariant random matrix
models. Thus, local eigenvalue correlations are expressed in terms of the sine
kernel in the bulk and in terms of the Airy kernel at the edge of the spectrum.
The result can be obtained by analyzing $4\times 4$ Riemann-Hilbert problem via
nonlinear steepest decent method.

rotational dynamics of single proteins as they move through the electric field

possibility to characterize, identify, and quantify individual proteins and

otherwise from single protein molecules in solution. Taken together, this
five-dimensional characterization of biomolecules at the single particle level
has the potential for instantaneous protein identification, quantification, and
