  Should we make difficult things easy or easy things look difficult? The first

traditional ""centralized"" statistical inference prohibitive. In addition to

design a data-intensive statistical inference architecture without changing the
basic statistical modeling principles developed for ""small"" data over the last

bosonization, the first time in its full complete form, for a spacetime with
3+1 dimensions, we are able to show that both electrons and Weyl fermions can

meta-analysis, and is a useful tool for detecting departures from the standard

extension of the funnel plot can help to facilitate an intuitive interpretation
of the mathematics underlying a meta-analysis at a more fundamental level, by
equating it to determining the centre of mass of a physical system. We used
this analogy, with some success, to explain the concepts of weighing evidence
and of biased evidence to a young audience at the Cambridge Science Festival,
without recourse to precise definitions or statistical formulae. In this paper
we aim to formalise this analogy at a more technical level using the estimating
equation framework: firstly, to help elucidate some of the basic statistical
models employed in a meta-analysis and secondly, to forge new connections
between bias adjustment in the evidence synthesis and causal inference

We show that this is due to a fundamental incompatibility between these two

universe is one realization of many possible cosmological histories. One way to
access different cosmological histories is via the nucleation of bubble
universes from a metastable false vacuum. Another way to sample different
cosmological histories is via classical transitions, the creation of pocket
universes through the collision between bubbles. Using relativistic numerical
simulations, we examine the possibility of observationally determining if our
observable universe resulted from a classical transition. We find that
classical transitions produce spatially infinite, approximately open
Friedman-Robertson-Walker universes. The leading set of observables in the
aftermath of a classical transition are negative spatial curvature and a
contribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature quadrupole. The
level of curvature and magnitude of the quadrupole are dependent on the
position of the observer, and we determine the possible range of observables
for two classes of single-scalar field models. For the first class, where the
inflationary phase has a lower energy than the vacuum preceding the classical
transition, the magnitude of the observed quadrupole generally falls to zero
with distance from the collision while the spatial curvature grows to a
constant. For the second class, where the inflationary phase has a higher
energy than the vacuum preceding the classical transition, the magnitude of the
observed quadrupole generically falls to zero with distance from the collision
while the spatial curvature grows without bound. We find that the magnitude of
the quadrupole and curvature grow with increasing centre of mass energy of the
collision, and explore variations of the parameters in the scalar field

launch of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) have provided brain research with
an abundance of structural connectivity data. In this work, we describe and
evaluate a method that can infer the structural brain network that
interconnects a given set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) from tractography data.
The proposed method, referred to as Minimum Asymmetry Network Inference
Algorithm (MANIA), differs from prior work because it does not determine the
connectivity between two ROIs based on an arbitrary connectivity threshold.
Instead, we exploit a basic limitation of the tractography process: the
observed streamlines from a source to a target do not provide any information
about the polarity of the underlying white matter, and so if there are some
fibers connecting two voxels (or two ROIs) X and Y tractography should be able
in principle to follow this connection in both directions, from X to Y and from
Y to X. We leverage this limitation to formulate the network inference process
as an optimization problem that minimizes the (appropriately normalized)
asymmetry of the observed network. We evaluate the proposed method on a noise
model that randomly corrupts the observed connectivity of synthetic networks.
As a case-study, we apply MANIA on diffusion MRI data from 28 healthy subjects
to infer the structural network between 18 corticolimbic ROIs that are

  Transporting a Rigid Body","Ph.D. Dissertation, The George Washington University",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This dissertation presents nonlinear tracking control systems for quadrotor
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) under the influence of uncertainties. Assuming
that there exist unstructured disturbances in the translational dynamics and
the attitude dynamics, a geometric nonlinear adaptive controller is developed
directly on the special Euclidean group. In particular, a new form of an
adaptive control term is proposed to guarantee stability while compensating the
effects of uncertainties in quadrotor dynamics. Next, we derived a
coordinate-free form of equations of motion for a complete model of a quadrotor
UAV with a payload which is connected via a flexible cable according to
Lagrangian mechanics on a manifold. The flexible cable is modeled as a system
of serially-connected links and has been considered in the full dynamic model.
A geometric nonlinear control system is presented to asymptotically stabilize
the position of the quadrotor while aligning the links to the vertical
direction below the quadrotor. Finally, we focused on the dynamics and control
of arbitrary number of quadrotor UAVs transporting a rigid body payload. The
rigid body payload is connected to quadrotors via flexible cables. It is shown
that a coordinate-free form of equations of motion can be derived for arbitrary
numbers of quadrotors and links according to Lagrangian mechanics on a
manifold. A geometric nonlinear controller is presented to transport the rigid
body to a fixed desired position while aligning all of the links along the
vertical direction. Numerical simulation and experimental results are presented
and rigorous mathematical stability analysis are provided. These results will
be particularly useful for aggressive load transportation that involves large
deformation of the cable.

concurring large-scale atmospheric state at two locations (Darwin and
Kwajalein) are used to establish effective stochastic models to parameterise
subgrid-scale tropical convective activity. Two approaches are presented which
rely on the assumption that tropical convection induces a stationary
equilibrium distribution. In the first approach we parameterise convection
variables such as convective area fraction as an instantaneous random
realisation conditioned on the large-scale vertical velocities according to a
probability density function estimated from the observations. In the second
approach convection variables are generated in a Markov process conditioned on
the large-scale vertical velocity, allowing for non-trivial temporal
correlations. Despite the different prevalent atmospheric and oceanic regimes
at the two locations, with Kwajalein being exposed to a purely oceanic weather
regime and Darwin exhibiting land-sea interaction, we establish that the
empirical measure for the convective variables conditioned on large-scale
mid-level vertical velocities for the two locations are close. This allows us
to train the stochastic models at one location and then generate time series of
convective activity at the other location. The proposed stochastic
subgrid-scale models adequately reproduce the statistics of the observed
convective variables and we discuss how they may be used in future
scale-independent mass-flux convection parameterisations.

on the reduction in Schottky barrier height at metal/MoS2 interface by
engineering the surface states through sulphur treatment. Electrical
characteristics for back-gated MoS2 field effect transistor structures were
investigated for two high work-function metal contacts Ni and Pd. Contacts on
MoS2 treated with sulphur exhibited significant improvements in Ohmic nature
with concomitant reduction in variability compared to those on untreated MoS2
films leading to a 2x increase in extracted mobility. X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, Raman Spectroscopy and comparison of threshold

sulphur treatment. The Schottky barrier heights were extracted from
temperature-dependent transfer characteristics based on the thermionic current
model. A reduction in barrier height of 80 and 135 meV extracted for Ni/MoS2
and Pd/MoS2 contacts respectively is hence attributed to the increase in
surface states (or stronger Fermi level pinning) due to sulphur treatment. The
corresponding charge neutrality levels at metal/MoS2 interface, were extracted
to be 0.16 eV (0.17 eV) below the conduction band before (after) Sulphur
treatment. This first report of surface states engineering in MoS2 leading to
superior contacts is expected to significantly benefit the entire class of

the interface between OMC-1 and the HII region surrounding the Trapezium
cluster. Around 15% of the [CII] emission arises from a different gas component
without CO counterpart. The [CII] excitation, PDR gas turbulence, line opacity
(from [13CII]) and role of the geometry of the illuminating stars with respect
to the cloud are investigated. We construct maps of the [CII]/FIR and FIR/M_Gas
ratios and show that [CII]/FIR decreases from the extended cloud component
(10^-2-10^-3) to the more opaque star-forming cores (10^-3-10^-4). The lowest
values are reminiscent of the ""[CII] deficit"" seen in local ultra-luminous IR
galaxies hosting vigorous star formation. Spatial correlation analysis shows
that the decreasing [CII]/FIR ratio correlates better with the column density
of dust through the molecular cloud than with FIR/M_Gas. We conclude that the
[CII] emitting column relative to the total dust column along each line of
sight is responsible for the observed [CII]/FIR variations through the cloud.

interactions in complex systems such as the Earth or the human brain from
measured time series. Recent work has focused on causal definitions of
information transfer excluding effects of common drivers and indirect
influences. While the former clearly constitutes a spurious causality, the aim
of the present article is to develop measures quantifying different notions of
the strength of information transfer along indirect causal paths, based on
first reconstructing the multivariate causal network (\emph{Tigramite}
approach). Another class of novel measures quantifies to what extent different
intermediate processes on causal paths contribute to an interaction mechanism
to determine pathways of causal information transfer. A rigorous mathematical
framework allows for a clear information-theoretic interpretation that can also
be related to the underlying dynamics as proven for certain classes of
processes. Generally, however, estimates of information transfer remain hard to
interpret for nonlinearly intertwined complex systems. But, if experiments or
mathematical models are not available, measuring pathways of information
transfer within the causal dependency structure allows at least for an
abstraction of the dynamics. The measures are illustrated on a climatological
example to disentangle pathways of atmospheric flow over Europe.

that MPT graphs are precisely obtained by intersecting special pairs of

intensities, k/h line ratios, line of sight velocities, line widths and line
asymmetries were investigated during an M class flare (SOL2014-02-13T01:40).
Very intense, spatially localised energy input at the outer edge of the ribbon
is observed, resulting in redshifts equivalent to velocities of ~15-26km/s,
line broadenings, and a blue asymmetry in the most intense sources. The
characteristic central reversal feature that is ubiquitous in quiet Sun
observations is absent in flaring profiles, indicating that the source function
increases with height during the flare. Despite the absence of the central
reversal feature, the k/h line ratio indicates that the lines remain optically
thick during the flare. Subordinate lines in the Mg II passband are observed to
be in emission in flaring sources, brightening and cooling with similar
timescales to the resonance lines. This work represents a first analysis of
potential diagnostic information of the flaring atmosphere using these lines,

discovery, but in many circumstances it is impossible to conduct RCTs.
Therefore observational studies based on passively observed data are widely
accepted as an alternative to RCTs. However, in observational studies, prior
knowledge is required to generate the hypotheses about the cause-effect
relationships to be tested, hence they can only be applied to problems with
available domain knowledge and a handful of variables. In practice, many data
sets are of high dimensionality, which leaves observational studies out of the
opportunities for causal discovery from such a wealth of data sources. In
another direction, many efficient data mining methods have been developed to
identify associations among variables in large data sets. The problem is,
causal relationships imply associations, but the reverse is not always true.
However we can see the synergy between the two paradigms here. Specifically,
association rule mining can be used to deal with the high-dimensionality
problem while observational studies can be utilised to eliminate non-causal
associations. In this paper we propose the concept of causal rules (CRs) and
develop an algorithm for mining CRs in large data sets. We use the idea of
retrospective cohort studies to detect CRs based on the results of association
rule mining. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data sets have
demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of CR mining. In comparison with
the commonly used causal discovery methods, the proposed approach in general is
faster and has better or competitive performance in finding correct or sensible
causes. It is also capable of finding a cause consisting of multiple variables,
a feature that other causal discovery methods do not possess.

proportion of cure, the risk of failure, irrespective of the cause, and the
relative risk of a certain cause of failure, given a failure occurred.
Covariates may affect each of these components. An appealing aspect of the
method is that it is a natural extension to competing risks of the
semi-parametric mixture cure model in ordinary survival analysis; thus, causes
of failure are assigned only if a failure occurs. This contrasts with the
existing mixture cure model for competing risks of Larson and Dinse, which
conditions at the onset on the future status presumably attained. Regression
parameter estimates are obtained using an EM-algorithm. The performance of the
estimators is evaluated in a simulation study. The method is illustrated using

two distinct regimes of fractional filling: monolayer coverage at the pore
walls and complete filling of the pores. For the layer coverage a slow surface
relaxation dominates the dielectric properties. For the entirely filled
channels the dielectric spectra are governed by two thermally-activated
relaxation processes with considerably different relaxation rates: A slow
relaxation in the interface layer next to the channel walls and a fast
relaxation in the core region of the channel filling. The strengths and
characteristic frequencies of both relaxation processes have been extracted and
analysed as a function of temperature. Whereas the temperature dependence of
the static capacitance reflects the effective (average) molecular ordering over
the pore volume and is well described within a Landau-de Gennes theory, the
extracted relaxation strengths of the slow and fast relaxation processes
provide an access to distinct local molecular ordering mechanisms. The order
parameter in the core region exhibits a bulk-like behaviour with a strong
increase in the nematic ordering just below the paranematic-to-nematic
transition temperature T_PN and subsequent saturation during cooling. By
contrast, the surface ordering evolves continuously with a kink near T_PN. A
comparison of the thermotropic behaviour of the monolayer with the complete
filling reveals that the molecular order in the core region of the pore filling
affects the order of the peripheral molecular layers at the wall.

non-archimedean completion of $K$, then $f$ has a point of period $n$ in $K$.
For $n\in\{4,5\}$ we show that there exist at most finitely many linear
conjugacy classes of quadratic polynomials over $K$ for which this local-global
principle fails. By considering a stronger form of this principle, we
strengthen global results obtained by Morton and Flynn-Poonen-Schaefer in the
case $K=\mathbf Q$. More precisely, we show that for every quadratic polynomial
$f\in\mathbf Q[x]$ there exist infinitely many primes $p$ such that $f$ does
not have a point of period 4 in the $p$-adic field $\mathbf Q_p$. Conditional
on knowing all rational points on a particular curve of genus 11, the same
result is proved for points of period 5.

$\kappa$-stationarily layered if the collection of regular suborders of
$\mathbb{P}$ of cardinality less than $\kappa$ is stationary in
$\mathcal{P}_\kappa(\mathbb{P})$. We show that weak compactness can be
characterized by this property of partial orders by proving that an uncountable
regular cardinal $\kappa$ is weakly compact if and only if every partial order
satisfying the $\kappa$-chain condition is $\kappa$-stationarily layered. We
prove a similar result for strongly inaccessible cardinals. Moreover, we show
that the statement that all $\kappa$-Knaster partial orders are
$\kappa$-stationarily layered implies that $\kappa$ is a Mahlo cardinal and
every stationary subset of $\kappa$ reflects. This shows that this statement
characterizes weak compactness in canonical inner models. In contrast, we show
that it is also consistent that this statement holds at a non-weakly compact
cardinal.

presence of a positive cosmological constant, is one of the most intriguing
results in classical general relativity. These results follow rigorously from
the Buchdahl inequalities in four dimensional de Sitter space. In this work, we
obtain the generalized Buchdahl inequalities in arbitrary space-time dimensions
with $\Lambda \neq 0$ and consider both the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter cases.
The dependence on $D$, the number of space-time dimensions, of the minimum and
maximum masses for stable spherical objects is explicitly obtained. The
analysis is then extended to the case of dark energy satisfying an arbitrary
linear barotropic equation of state. The Jeans instability of barotropic dark
energy is also investigated, for arbitrary $D$, in the framework of a simple
Newtonian model with and without viscous dissipation, and we determine the
dispersion relation describing the dark energy$-$matter condensation process,
along with estimates of the corresponding Jeans mass (and radius). Finally, the
quantum mechanical implications of mass limits are investigated, and we show
that the existence of a minimum mass scale naturally leads to a model in which
dark energy is composed of a `sea' of quantum particles, each with an effective
mass proportional to $\Lambda^{1/4}$.

a generalization of both vertex-transitive and distance-regular graphs. Let
$\Gamma$ be a graph with vertex set $V$, diameter $D$, adjacency matrix $A$,
and adjacency algebra ${\cal A}$. Then, $\Gamma$ is $distance$ $mean$-$regular$
when, for a given $u\in V$, the averages of the intersection numbers
$p_{ij}^h(u,v)=|\Gamma_i(u)\cap \Gamma_j(v)|$ (number of vertices at distance
$i$ from $u$ and distance $j$ from $v$) computed over all vertices $v$ at a
given distance $h\in \{0,1,\ldots,D\}$ from $u$, do not depend on $u$. In this
work we study some properties and characterizations of these graphs. For
instance, it is shown that a distance mean-regular graph is always distance
degree-regular, and we give a condition for the converse to be also true. Some
algebraic and spectral properties of distance mean-regular graphs are also
investigated. We show that, for distance mean regular-graphs, the role of the
distance matrices of distance-regular graphs is played for the so-called
distance mean-regular matrices. These matrices are computed from a sequence of
orthogonal polynomials evaluated at the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$ and,
hence, they generate a subalgebra of ${\cal A}$. Some other algebras associated
to distance mean-regular graphs are also characterized.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1401.3024",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown that the hypothesis of the axion mechanism for solar luminosity
variations suggesting that the solar axion particles are born in the core of

result, it is also shown that the intensity variations of the $\gamma$-quanta
of axion origin, induced by the magnetic field variations in the tachocline via
the thermomagnetic Ettingshausen-Nernst effect, directly cause the Sun
luminosity variations and eventually characterize the active and quiet states

  Within the framework of this mechanism estimations of the strength of the
axion coupling to a photon ($g_{a \gamma} = 4.4 \cdot 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}$) and
the hadronic axion particle mass ($m_a \sim 3.2 \cdot 10^{-2} eV$) have been

low-resolution circular polarised spectra of nearly a thousand different stars,
with the aim of measuring their mean longitudinal magnetic fields. A catalogue
of FORS1 magnetic measurements would provide a valuable resource with which to
better understand the strengths and limitations of this instrument and of
similar low-dispersion, Cassegrain spectropolarimeters. However, FORS1 data
reduction has been carried out by a number of different groups using a variety
of reduction and analysis techniques. Our understanding of the instrument and
our data reduction techniques have both improved over time. A full re-analysis
of FORS1 archive data using a consistent and fully documented algorithm would
optimise the accuracy and usefulness of a catalogue of field measurements.
Based on the ESO FORS pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure
for magnetic field determinations, which includes self-consistent checks for
field detection reliability. We have applied our procedure to the full content
of circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the FORS1 archive. We have
produced a catalogue of spectro-polarimetric observations and magnetic field
measurements for about 1400 observations of about 850 different objects. The
spectral type of each object has been accurately classified. We have also been
able to test different methods for data reduction is a systematic way. The
resulting catalogue has been used to produce an estimator for an upper limit to
the uncertainty in a field strength measurement of an early type star as a
function of the signal-to-noise ratio of the observation. While FORS1 is not
necessarily an optimal instrument for the discovery of weak magnetic fields, it
is very useful for the systematic study of larger fields, such as those found
in Ap/Bp stars and in white dwarfs.
