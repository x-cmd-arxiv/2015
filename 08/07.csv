investigate Glueball production in the radiative decays of vector states of

  to SPARQL","Journal Paper",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The logic-based machine-understandable framework of the Semantic Web often
challenges naive users when they try to query ontology-based knowledge bases.
Existing research efforts have approached this problem by introducing Natural
Language (NL) interfaces to ontologies. These NL interfaces have the ability to
construct SPARQL queries based on NL user queries. However, most efforts were
restricted to queries expressed in English, and they often benefited from the
advancement of English NLP tools. However, little research has been done to
support querying the Arabic content on the Semantic Web by using NL queries.
This paper presents a domain-independent approach to translate Arabic NL
queries to SPARQL by leveraging linguistic analysis. Based on a special
consideration on Noun Phrases (NPs), our approach uses a language parser to
extract NPs and the relations from Arabic parse trees and match them to the
underlying ontology. It then utilizes knowledge in the ontology to group NPs
into triple-based representations. A SPARQL query is finally generated by
extracting targets and modifiers, and interpreting them into SPARQL. The
interpretation of advanced semantic features including negation, conjunctive
and disjunctive modifiers is also supported. The approach was evaluated by
using two datasets consisting of OWL test data and queries, and the obtained
results have confirmed its feasibility to translate Arabic NL queries to
SPARQL.

network optimization problem with respect to the removal of a limited set of
edges or vertices. One of the oldest and best-studied interdiction problems is
minimum spanning tree (MST) interdiction. Here, an undirected multigraph with
nonnegative edge weights and positive interdiction costs on its edges is given,
together with a positive budget B. The goal is to find a subset of edges R,
whose total interdiction cost does not exceed B, such that removing R leads to
a graph where the weight of an MST is as large as possible. Frederickson and
Solis-Oba (SODA 1996) presented an O(log m)-approximation for MST interdiction,
where m is the number of edges. Since then, no further progress has been made
regarding approximations, and the question whether MST interdiction admits an
O(1)-approximation remained open.
  We answer this question in the affirmative, by presenting a 14-approximation
that overcomes two main hurdles that hindered further progress so far.
Moreover, based on a well-known 2-approximation for the metric traveling
salesman problem (TSP), we show that our O(1)-approximation for MST
interdiction implies an O(1)-approximation for a natural interdiction version
of metric TSP.

accounting for sampling errors. Additionally, 3-year ACS period estimates are
to be discontinued, and this methodology can provide predictions of ACS

methodology is based on a spatio-temporal mixed effects model with a
low-dimensional spatio-temporal basis function representation, which provides
multi-resolution estimates through basis function aggregation in space and

its internal structure on its response to an electromagnetic probe as studied
in elastic electron-nucleon scattering. These form factors are functions of the
squared four-momentum transfer $Q^2$ between the electron and the proton. The
two main classes of observables of this reaction are the scattering cross
section and polarization asymmetries, both of which are sensitive to the form
factors in different ways. When considering large momentum transfers,
double-polarization observables offer superior sensitivity to the electric form
factor. This thesis reports the results of a new measurement of the ratio of
the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton at high momentum transfer
using the recoil polarization technique. A polarized electron beam was
scattered from a liquid hydrogen target, transferring polarization to the
recoiling protons. These protons were detected in a magnetic spectrometer which
was used to reconstruct their kinematics, including their scattering angles and
momenta, and the position of the interaction vertex. A proton polarimeter
measured the polarization of the recoiling protons by measuring the azimuthal
asymmetry in the angular distribution of protons scattered in CH$_2$ analyzers.
The scattered electron was detected in a large-acceptance electromagnetic
calorimeter in order to suppress inelastic backgrounds. The measured ratio of
the transverse and longitudinal polarization components of the scattered proton
is directly proportional to the ratio of form factors $G_E^p/G_M^p$. The
measurements reported in this thesis took place at $Q^2=$5.2, 6.7, and 8.5
GeV$^2$, and represent the most accurate measurements of $G_E^p$ in this $Q^2$
region to date.

excess for electrons and positrons is obtained as a difference between the

of electron and positron excess is observed and we interpreted this excess
(above $\sim$100 GeV in the AMS-02 data) as a supply coming from Vela-X. The
particle contribution is consistent with models predicting the gamma-ray
emission at the source. The input of a few more young pulsars is also allowed,

the radio resource allocation problem in a two-hop network to guarantee the

Utilizing time sharing strategy, we provide a centralized solution under
bounded channel uncertainty. With a view to reducing the computational burden

The liquid magma ocean cools over 2-10 Myrs, with longer times corresponding to
high angular-momentum events. Tidal heating is focused mostly in mantle
materials that are just beginning to freeze. The atmosphere's control over
cooling sets up a negative feedback between viscosity-dependent tidal heating
and temperature-dependent viscosity of the magma ocean. While the feedback
holds, evolution of the Moon's orbit is limited by the modest radiative cooling
rate of Earth's atmosphere. Orbital evolution is orders of magnitude slower
than in conventional constant Q models, which promotes capture by resonances.
The evection resonance is encountered early, when the Earth is molten. Capture
by the evection resonance appears certain but unlikely to generate much
eccentricity because it is encountered early when the Earth is molten and
Q_Earth >> Q_Moon. Tidal dissipation in the Earth becomes more efficient
(Q_Earth << Q_Moon) later when the Moon is between ~20 R_Earth and ~40 R_Earth.
If lunar eccentricity grew great, this was when it did so, perhaps setting the
table for some other process to leave its mark on the inclination of the Moon.

Girardello and Porrati while on the other hand allows to recover the
multi-vector BI models from $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity as the end-point of a
hierarchical limit in which the Planck mass first and then the supersymmetry
breaking scale are sent to infinity.
  We define, in the parent supergravity model, a new symplectic frame in which,
in the rigid limit, manifest symplectic invariance is preserved and the
electric and magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos terms are fully originated from the
dyonic components of the embedding tensor. The supergravity origin of several
features of the resulting rigid supersymmetric theory will be elucidated, such
as the presence of a traceless ${\rm SU}(2)$- Lie algebra term in the Ward
identity and the existence of a central charge in the supersymmetry algebra

events are further combined with parton showering and hadronization provided by
PYTHIA8. The 0-jettiness resummation is carried out to NNLL', which
consistently incorporates all singular virtual and real NNLO corrections. It
thus provides a natural perturbative connection between the NNLO calculation
and the parton shower regime, including a systematic assessment of perturbative
uncertainties. In this way, inclusive observables are correct to NNLO, up to
small power corrections in the resolution cutoff. Furthermore, the perturbative
accuracy of 0-jet-like resummation variables is significantly improved beyond
the parton shower approximation. We provide comparisons with LHC measurements
of Drell-Yan production at 7 TeV from ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb. As already observed
in $e^+e^-$ collisions, for resummation-sensitive observables, the agreement
with data is noticeably improved by using a lower value of $\alpha_s(M_Z) =

2.4 GHz phonons are combined with photonic and phononic waveguides. Working in
GaAs facilitates manipulation of the localized mechanical mode either with a
radio frequency field through the piezo-electric effect, or optically through
the strong photoelastic effect. We use this to demonstrate a novel acoustic
wave interference effect, analogous to coherent population trapping in atomic
systems, in which the coherent mechanical motion induced by the electrical
drive can be completely cancelled out by the optically-driven motion. The
ability to manipulate cavity optomechanical systems with equal facility through
either photonic or phononic channels enables new device and system
architectures for signal transduction between the optical, electrical, and
mechanical domains.

  application to large eddy simulation turbulence models","23 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is wide agreement that the accuracy of turbulence models suffer from
their sensitivity with respect to physical input data, the uncertainties of
user-elected parameters, as well as the model inadequacy. However, the
application of Bayesian inference to systematically quantify the uncertainties
in parameters, by means of exploring posterior probability density functions
(PPDFs), has been hindered by the prohibitively daunting computational cost
associated with the large number of model executions, in addition to daunting
computation time per one turbulence simulation. In this effort, we perform in
this paper an adaptive hierarchical sparse grid surrogate modeling approach to
Bayesian inference of large eddy simulation (LES). First, an adaptive
hierarchical sparse grid surrogate for the output of forward models is
constructed using a relatively small number of model executions. Using such
surrogate, the likelihood function can be rapidly evaluated at any point in the
parameter space without simulating the computationally expensive LES model.
This method is essentially similar to those developed in [62] for geophysical
and groundwater models, but is adjusted and applied here for a much more
challenging problem of uncertainty quantification of turbulence models. Through
a numerical demonstration of the Smagorinsky model of two-dimensional flow
around a cylinder at sub-critical Reynolds number, our approach is proven to
significantly reduce the number of costly LES executions without losing much
accuracy in the posterior probability estimation. Here, the model parameters
are calibrated against synthetic data related to the mean flow velocity and
Reynolds stresses at different locations in the flow wake. The influence of the
user-elected LES parameters on the quality of output data will be discussed.

approximation is employed for studying the role of finite size effect on the
electronic properties of elongated graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions.
In our model, the GNR heterojunction is divided into three parts: a left (L)
part, middle (M) part, and right (R) part. The left part is a GNR of width
$W_{L}$, the middle part is a GNR of width $W_{M}$, and the right part is a GNR
of width $W_{R}$. We assume that the left and right parts of the GNR
heterojunction interact with the middle part only. Under this approximation,
the Hamiltonian of the system can be expressed as a block tridiagonal matrix.
The matrix elements of the tridiagonal matrix are computed using real space
nearest neighbor orthogonal TB approximation. The electronic structure of the
GNR heterojunction is analyzed by computing the density of states. We
demonstrate that for heterojunctions for which $W_{L} = W_{R}$, the band gap of
the system can be tuned continuously by varying the length of the middle part,
thus providing a new approach to band gap engineering in GNRs. Our TB results
were compared with calculations employing divide and conquer rule in
combination with density functional theory (DFT) and were found to agree
nicely.

viable heating mechanism in the solar chromospheric plasma. Here, we use a
simplified one-dimensional model of the chromosphere to theoretically
investigate the physical processes and the spatial scales that are required for
the efficient dissipation of Alfv\'en waves and slow magnetoacoustic waves. We
consider the governing equations for a partially ionized hydrogen-helium plasma
in the single-fluid MHD approximation and include realistic wave damping
mechanisms that may operate in the chromosphere, namely Ohmic and ambipolar
magnetic diffusion, viscosity, thermal conduction, and radiative losses. We
perform an analytic local study in the limit of small amplitudes to
approximately derive the lengthscales for critical damping and efficient
dissipation of MHD wave energy. We find that the critical dissipation
lengthscale for Alfv\'en waves depends strongly on the magnetic field strength
and ranges from 10~m to 1~km for realistic field strengths. The damping of
Alfv\'en waves is dominated by Ohmic diffusion for weak magnetic field and low
heights in the chromosphere, and by ambipolar diffusion for strong magnetic
field and medium/large heights in the chromosphere. Conversely, the damping of
slow magnetoacoustic waves is less efficient, and spatial scales shorter than
10~m are required for critical damping. Thermal conduction and viscosity govern
the damping of slow magnetoacoustic waves and play an equally important role at
all heights. These results indicate that the spatial scales at which strong
wave heating may work in the chromosphere are currently unresolved by
observations.

consistent with previous parametric fits, with no evidence for a break within

infer a hot halo mass comparable to the stellar mass of the galaxy, and a
baryon fraction from the stars and hot gas of around 30%. The cooling time of
the hot gas is orders of magnitude longer than the dynamical time, making the
hot halo stable against cooling instabilities, and we argue that an extended

full or partial gapping of Fermi surface (FS) leading a metal-insulator or

signatures of symmetry breaking. One example is Na$_2$Ti$_2$Sb$_2$O, where a
partial gapping of FS is observed but a density wave ordering has not been
found. Here we propose a microscopic mechanism of such a MMT which occurs due
to a momentum dependent spin-orbit coupled molecular orbital polarization.
Since a molecular $d$ orbital polarization is present due to a small spin-orbit
coupling of Ti, there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking involved. However, a
sharp increase of polarization happens above a critical electron interaction
which gaps out the $d$ orbtial FS and reduces the density of states
significantly, while the rest of FS associated with Sb $p$ orbtials is almost
intact across MMT. Experimental implications to test our proposal and
applications to other systems are also discussed.

emission. Asymmetry in this emission imparts a recoil kick to the merged BH,
which can eject the BH from its host galaxy altogether. Recoiling BHs could be
observed as offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). Several candidates have been
identified, but systematic searches have been hampered by large uncertainties
regarding their observability. By extracting merging BHs and host galaxy
properties from the Illustris cosmological simulations, we have developed a
comprehensive model for recoiling AGN. Here, for the first time, we model the
effects of BH spin alignment and recoil dynamics based on the gas-richness of
host galaxies. We predict that if BH spins are not highly aligned,
seeing-limited observations could resolve offset AGN, making them promising
targets for all-sky surveys. For randomly-oriented spins, less than about 10
spatially-offset AGN may be detectable in HST-COSMOS, and > 10^3 could be found
with Pan-STARRS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. Nearly a thousand velocity-offset
AGN are predicted within the SDSS footprint; the rarity of large broad-line
offsets among SDSS quasars is likely due in part to selection effects but
suggests that spin alignment plays a role in suppressing recoils. Nonetheless,
in our most physically motivated model where alignment occurs only in gas-rich
mergers, hundreds of offset AGN should be found in all-sky surveys. Our
findings strongly motivate a dedicated search for recoiling AGN.

densities and high temperatures. Cosmological simulations of structure
formation can be used to verify this picture and provide quantitative
predictions for the distribution of mass in different large-scale structure
components. Here we study the distribution of baryons and dark matter at
different epochs using data from the Illustris simulation. We identify regions
of different dark matter density with the primary constituents of large-scale
structure, allowing us to measure mass and volume of haloes, filaments and
voids. At redshift zero, we find that 49 % of the dark matter and 23 % of the

in voids. The majority of these baryons have been transported there through
active galactic nuclei feedback. We note that the feedback model of Illustris
is too strong for heavy haloes, therefore it is likely that we are
overestimating this amount. Categorizing the baryons according to their density

of angular observables in $B \to K^*$ are still allowed to be up to two orders
of magnitude larger than in the standard model, which would place them in the

is an important issue in the development of neuronal networks. During their
growth, axons often face complex decisions that are difficult to understand
when observing just a small part of the problem. In this work we propose a
computational model of AG based on activity-independent mechanisms that takes
into account the most important aspects of AG.
  The model includes the main elements (neurons, with soma, axon and growth
cone; glial cells acting as guideposts) and mechanisms (attraction/repulsion
guidance cues, growth cone adaptation, tissue-gradient intersections, axonal
transport, changes in the growth cone complexity and a range of responses for
each receptor). The growth cone guidance is defined as a function that maps the
receptor activation by ligands into a repulsive or attractive force. This force
is then converted into a turn- ing angle using spherical coordinates. A
regulatory network between the receptors and the intracellular proteins is
considered, leading to more complex and realistic behaviors. The ligand
diffusion through the extracellular environment is modeled with linear or
exponential functions. Concerning experimentation, it was developed the first
computational model and a new theoretical model of the midline crossing of
Drosophila axons that focus all the decision points. The computational model
created allows describing to a great extent the behaviors that have been
reported in the literature, for three different pathfinding scenarios: (i)
normal, (ii) comm mutant and (iii) robo mutant. Moreover, this model suggests
new hypotheses, being the most relevant the existence of an inhibitory link
between the DCC receptor and the Comm protein that is Netrin-mediated or
mediated by a third unknown signal.

spacecraft measurements near the Earth, the interstellar spectra of primary
cosmic ray nuclei from H to Fe have now been determined from ~10 MeV/nuc to >
100 GeV/nuc. These measurements are compared with the predictions from a Leaky
Box propagation model. It is found that above ~50-100 MeV/nuc the spectra of
all the nuclei, H, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe are well connected between 100
MeV/nuc and 10 GeV/nuc and above by simple source rigidity spectra proportional
to P-2.28, with the exponent independent of rigidity and using a rigidity
dependent diffusion coefficient ~P0.50 above ~1.0 GV. This leads to intensities
and spectra ~P-2.78 at ~100 GeV/nuc and above, which are consistent with new
AMS-2 and PAMELA measurements of H, He and C to within + 10%.
  Below 50-100 MeV the spectra of these primary charges fall into two groups.
The spectra of primary nuclei with Z > 6 fall more rapidly at low energies than
those of H and He and more rapidly than would be expected from a pure diffusive
LBM, where energy loss by ionization is important at low energies. Increasing
the fraction of ionized hydrogen in the interstellar medium from 15% to 30%
does not satisfactorily explain the systematics of the intensity decreases of
the heavier primary nuclei at low energies. Other processes beyond those
assumed in a simple leaky box model, such as a lack of cosmic ray sources near
the Sun are being investigated as the source of this more rapid intensity
decrease of these nuclei.
  The spectra of H and He are very similar to each other but both contain more
low energy particles than would be expected from a correspondence with the
heavier nuclei spectra. We believe that this may indicate the presence of a
local (heliospheric) component of these nuclei in addition to the galactic
component.

Fermi systems: it states that the volume inside the Fermi surface is left
invariant by interactions, if the number of particles is held fixed. Although
this is traditionally justified using perturbation theory, it can be viewed as
arising from a momentum balance argument that examines the response of the
ground state to the insertion of a single flux quantum [M. Oshikawa, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 84, 3370 (2000)]. This reveals that the Fermi sea volume is a
topologically protected quantity. Extending this approach, I show that spinless
or spin-rotation-preserving fermionic systems in non-symmorphic crystals
possess generalized topological 'Luttinger invariants' that can be nonzero even
in cases where the Fermi sea volume vanishes. A nonzero Luttinger invariant
then forces energy bands to touch, leading to semimetals whose gaplessness is
thus rooted in topology; opening a gap without symmetry breaking automatically
triggers fractionalization. The existence of these invariants is linked to the
inability of non-symmorphic crystals to host band insulating ground states
except at special fillings. I exemplify the use of these new invariants by
showing that they distinguish various classes of two- and three-dimensional
semimetals.

Alternatively, one customizes learning algorithms to achieve scalability. In
either case, the key challenge is to obtain algorithmic efficiency without
compromising the quality of the results. In this paper we discuss a
meta-learning algorithm (PSBML) which combines features of parallel algorithms

convergence to a distribution centered around the margin. We then present
additional empirical analyses showing that this meta-level algorithm provides a

of learning classifiers. We perform extensive experiments to investigate the
tradeoff achieved between scalability and accuracy, and robustness to noise, on

such regions can be inferred from fluorescence measurements obtained by binding
a complementary probe with fluorescence markers to the targeted regions. We use
a biophysical model which shows that the fluorescence ratio under the log scale
has a sparse linear relationship with the coefficients describing the
accessibility of each nucleotide, since not all sites are accessible (due to
the folding of the molecule). The SpKG algorithm uniquely combines the Bayesian
ranking and selection problem with the frequentist $\ell_1$ regularized
regression approach Lasso. We use this algorithm to identify the sparsity
pattern of the linear model as well as sequentially decide the best regions to
test before experimental budget is exhausted. Besides, we also develop two
other new algorithms: batch SpKG algorithm, which generates more suggestions
sequentially to run parallel experiments; and batch SpKG with a procedure which
we call length mutagenesis. It dynamically adds in new alternatives, in the
form of types of probes, are created by inserting, deleting or mutating
nucleotides within existing probes. In simulation, we demonstrate these
algorithms on the Group I intron (a mid-size RNA molecule), showing that they
efficiently learn the correct sparsity pattern, identify the most accessible
region, and outperform several other policies.

As gas flow in shale matrix is mostly in the slip flow and transition flow
regimes, given the difficulties of experimental techniques to determine
extremely low permeability, it appears that the computational methods

of capturing gas flow in continuum to slip flow regimes which cover significant

analyze videotaped discourse of a tutorial group's early discussions to

sensemake. I find that the students and instructors alike rely on a common
discursive resource - epistemic distancing - to share their ideas while
protecting themselves affectively if others disagree. Epistemic distancing
includes hedging, joking, deferring, and other discourse moves used to soften
one's stance in conversation. I use video analysis to illustrate the effects of
these moves on tutorial groups' sensemaking discussions, and discuss

regular lattices to complex networks, are ubiquitous across physics, chemistry,
and biology. Models with coarse-grained states, for example those employed in
studies of molecular kinetics, and models with spatial disorder can give rise
to memory and non-exponential distributions of waiting times and first-passage
statistics. However, existing methods for analyzing CTRWs on complex energy
landscapes do not address these effects. We therefore use statistical mechanics
of the nonequilibrium path ensemble to characterize first-passage CTRWs on
networks with arbitrary connectivity, energy landscape, and waiting time
distributions. Our approach is valuable for calculating higher moments (beyond
the mean) of path length, time, and action, as well as statistics of any
conservative or non-conservative force along a path. For homogeneous networks
we derive exact relations between length and time moments, quantifying the
validity of approximating a continuous-time process with its discrete-time
projection. For more general models we obtain recursion relations, reminiscent
of transfer matrix and exact enumeration techniques, to efficiently calculate
path statistics numerically. We have implemented our algorithm in PathMAN, a
Python script that users can easily apply to their model of choice. We
demonstrate the algorithm on a few representative examples which underscore the
importance of non-exponential distributions, memory, and coarse-graining in
CTRWs.

limit is developed, and the analysis reveals important insight for the dynamics
of an epithelium close to its steady state. When the proliferative cells occupy
a thin region close to the basal membrane, the relaxation rate towards the
steady state is enhanced by cell division and cell apoptosis. On the other
hand, when the region where proliferative cells reside becomes sufficiently
thick, a flow induced by cell apoptosis close to the apical surface could
enhance small perturbations. This destabilizing mechanism is general for
continuous self-renewal multi-layered tissues, it could be related to the
origin of certain tissue morphology and developing pattern.

developing digital tracking methodology for detecting asteroids using
large-format CCD imagers. We demonstrate that the technique enables the
ground-based detection of large numbers of new faint asteroids. Our methodology
resolves or circumvents all major obstacles to the large-scale application of
digital tracking for finding main belt and near-Earth asteroids. We find that
for both asteroid populations, digital tracking can deliver a factor of ten
improvement over conventional searches. Digital tracking has long been standard
practice for deep Kuiper Belt surveys, but even there our methodology enables
deeper integrations than have yet been attempted. Our search for main belt
asteroids using a one-degree imager on the 0.9m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak
validates our methodology, delivers sensitivity to asteroids in a regime
previously probed only with 4-meter and larger instruments, and leads to the
detection of 156 previously unknown asteroids and 59 known objects in a single

using Wind and ACE instruments have shown that there is a significant drop in
the density, magnetic field, total pressure, and Alfven speed in the inner
heliosphere as a result of the low solar activity. The drop in large space
weather events is disproportionately high because the number of energetic
coronal mass ejections that cause these events has not decreased significantly.
For example, the rate of halo CMEs, which is a good indicator of energetic

declined by about 40%. The mild space weather seems to be a consequence of the
anomalous expansion of CMEs due to the low ambient pressure in the heliosphere.
The anomalous expansion results in the dilution of the magnetic contents of

propagating through the weak heliospheric field are less efficient in

conservation to the electric susceptibility) and the transverse conductivity
$\sigma _{T}$ are different in the long wave length limit and consequently the

remarkable effects in transport and optical response. We predict a charging
effect in DC transport that is a direct signature of the nonlocality. The
optical response of the WSM is also sensitive to the nonlocality. In these
materials p-polarized light generates bulk plasmons as well as the transversal
waves. The propagation inside the WSM is only slightly attenuated. At a
specific (material parameter dependent) frequency the two modes coincide, a
phenomenon impossible in a local medium. Remarkably, for any frequency there is
an incident angle where total absorption occurs, turning the WSM opaque.

are characterized by two main sources of uncertainties--internal and model
variabilities. Using an ensemble of climate model simulations from the CMIP5
decadal experiments, we quantified the total uncertainty associated with these
predictions and the relative importance of each source. Annual and monthly
averages of the surface temperature and wind components were considered. We
show that different definitions of the anomaly results in different conclusions
regarding the variance of the ensemble members. However, some features of the
uncertainty are common to all the measures we considered. We found that over
decadal time scales, there is no considerable increase in the uncertainty with
time. The model variability is more sensitive to the annual cycle than the
internal variability. This, in turn, results in a maximal uncertainty during
the winter in the northern hemisphere. The uncertainty of the surface
temperature prediction is dominated by the model variability, whereas the
uncertainty of the wind components is determined by both sources. Analysis of
the spatial distribution of the uncertainty reveals that the surface
temperature has higher variability over land and in high latitudes, whereas the
surface zonal wind has higher variability over the ocean. The relative
importance of the internal and model variabilities depends on the averaging
period, the definition of the anomaly, and the location. These findings suggest
that several methods should be combined in order to assess future climate
prediction uncertainties and that weighting schemes of the ensemble members may
reduce the uncertainties.

are often characterized by the presence of antenna structures where the light
is captured and inner structures (reaction centers) where the excitation is
transferred. Antennae often display distinguished coherent features: their
eigenstates can be separated, with respect to the transfer of excitation, in
the two classes of superradiant and subradiant states. Both are important to
optimize transfer efficiency. In absence of disorder superradiant states have
an enhanced coupling strength to the RC, while subradiant ones are basically
decoupled from it. Disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and
superradiant states, thus creating an indirect coupling to the RC. We consider
the problem of finding the maximal excitation transfer efficiency as a function
of the RC energy and the disorder strength, first in a paradigmatic three-level
system and then in a realistic model for the light-harvesting complex of purple
bacteria. Specifically, we focus on the case in which the excitation is
initially on a subradiant state, showing that the optimal disorder is of the
order of the superradiant coupling. We also determine the optimal detuning
between the initial state and the RC energy. We show that the efficiency
remains high around the optimal detuning in a large energy window, proportional
to the superradiant coupling. This allows for the simultaneous optimization of
excitation transfer from several initial states with different optimal
detuning.

star formation rates and dust corrections. On the contrary, simulations are not
able to reproduce results that were obtained by combining only UV and IR
luminosities. These imply SFRs at a fixed stellar mass that are larger almost
by a factor of 5 than those of SED measurements for $z \sim1.5-4$. Furthermore,
we find remarkable agreement between the numerical results from various authors
who have employed different cosmological codes and run simulations with
different resolutions. This is interesting for two reasons. A) simulations can
produce realistic populations of galaxies within representative cosmological
volumes even at relatively modest resolutions. B) It is likely that current
numerical codes that rely on similar subgrid multiphase Inter-Stellar Medium
(ISM) models and are tuned to reproduce statistical properties of galaxies,
produce similar results for the SFR$-{\rm M}_{\star}$ relation by construction,
regardless of resolution, box size and, to some extent, the adopted feedback
prescriptions.

Graphene and few-layer graphene have attracted tremendous attention for heat
removal thanks to their extraordinarily high in-plane thermal conductivity.
However, this high thermal conductivity undergoes severe degradations caused by
the contact with the substrate and the functionalization-induced point defects.
Here we show that thermal management of a micro heater can be substantially
improved via introduction of alternative heat-escaping channels implemented
with graphene-based film covalently bonded to functionalized graphene oxide
through silane molecules. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a
counter-intuitive enhancement of the thermal conductivity of such a
graphene-based film. This increase in the in-plane thermal conductivity of
supported graphene is accompanied by an improvement on the graphene-substrates
thermal contact. Using infrared thermal imaging, we demonstrate that the
temperature of the hotspots can be lowered by 12 $^o$C in transistors operating
at 130 W mm$^{-2}$ , which corresponds to half of an order-of-magnitude
increase in the device lifetime. Ab initio and molecular dynamics simulations
reveal that the functionalization constrains the cross-plane scattering of low
frequency phonons, which in turn enhances in-plane heat conduction of the
bonded graphene film by recovering the long flexural phonon lifetime.

consists of a set of hybrid access point (AP)-source pairs and a power beacon
(PB). Each source, which has no embedded power supply, first harvests energy
from its associated AP and/or the PB in the downlink (DL) and then uses the
harvested energy to transmit information to its AP in the uplink (UL). We
consider both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios based on whether the PB
is cooperative with the APs or not. For the cooperative scenario, we formulate
a social welfare maximization problem to maximize the weighted sum-throughput
of all AP-source pairs, which is subsequently solved by a water-filling based
distributed algorithm. In the non-cooperative scenario, all the APs and the PB
are assumed to be rational and self-interested such that incentives from each
AP are needed for the PB to provide wireless charging service. We then
formulate an auction game and propose an auction based distributed algorithm by
considering the PB as the auctioneer and the APs as the bidders. Finally,
numerical results are performed to validate the convergence of both the
proposed algorithms and demonstrate the impacts of various system parameters.

This feature of multi-radio wireless mesh network makes high throughput for the

multiple channel availability for transmission decreases the probability of the
most elegant problem called as interference problem which is either of
interflow and intraflow type. For avoiding the problem like interference and
maintaining the constant network performance or increasing the performance the
WMN need to consider the packet aggregation and packet forwarding. Packet
aggregation is process of collecting several packets ready for transmission and
sending them to the intended recipient through the channel, while the packet
forwarding holds the hop-by-hop routing. But choosing the correct path among
different available multiple paths is most the important factor in the both
case for a routing algorithm. Hence the most challenging factor is to determine
a forwarding strategy which will provide the schedule for each node for
transmission within the channel. In this research work we have tried to
implement two forwarding strategies for the multi path multi radio WMN as the
approximate solution for the above said problem. We have implemented Global

Aggregation Aware Layer 2 Routing (AAL2R) which considers the both concept i.e.

a periodic array of rigid heavy rings, each one connected to the others through
elastic slender massless ligaments and containing an internal resonator made of
a rigid disk in a soft elastic annulus. The band structure and the occurrence
of low frequency band-gaps are analysed through a discrete Lagrangian model.
For both the hexa- and the tetrachiral lattice, two acoustic modes and four

the band structure. By approximating the generalized displacements of the rings
of the discrete Lagrangian model as a continuum field and through an

Poincar\'e type algebras over any field $K$. In this paper we study the ideal
structure of Lorentz and of Poincar\'e type algebras over different fields. It
turns out that Lorentz type algebras are simple if and only if the ground field
has no square root of $-1$. Thus, they are simple over the reals but not over
the complex. Also, if the ground field is of characteristic $2$ then Lorentz
and Poincar\'e type algebras are neither simple nor semisimple. We extend the
study of simplicity of the Lorentz algebra to the case of a ring of scalars

$m$ of the ground ring of scalars). The Lorentz type algebras over a finite

  model",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In data envelopment analysis (DEA), the concept of efficiency is examined in
either Farrell (DEA) or Pareto senses. In either of these senses, the
efficiency status of a decision making unit (DMU) is classified as either weak
or strong. It is well established that the strong DEA efficiency is both
necessary and sufficient for achieving the Pareto efficiency. For the weak
Pareto efficiency, however, the weak DEA efficiency is only sufficient, but not
necessary in general. Therefore, a DEA-inefficient DMU can be either weakly
Pareto efficient or Pareto inefficient. Motivated by this fact, we propose a
new classification of DMUs in terms of both DEA and Pareto efficiencies. To
make this classification, we first demonstrate that the Farrell efficiency is
based on the notion of FGL dominance. Based on the concept of dominance, we
then propose and substantiate an alternative single-stage method. Our method is
computationally efficient since (i) it involves solving a unique single-stage
model for each DMU, and (ii) it accomplishes the classification of DMUs in both
input and output orientations simultaneously. Finally, we present a numerical
example to illustrate our proposed method.

space model: $\Phi_{k+1} = F(\Phi_k, \alpha(\Phi_k, U_{k+1}))$ where the
function $F$ is $C^1$ while $\alpha$ is typically discontinuous and $\{U_k: k
\in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0} \}$ is an independent and identically distributed process.
We assume that for all $x$, the random variable $\alpha(x, U_1)$ admits a
density $p_x$ such that $(x, w) \mapsto p_x(w)$ is lower semi-continuous.
  We generalize and extend previous results that connect properties of the
underlying deterministic control model to provide conditions for the chain to
be $\varphi$-irreducible and aperiodic. By building on those results, we show
that if a rank condition on the controllability matrix is satisfied for all
$x$, there is equivalence between the existence of a globally attracting state
for the control model and $\varphi$-irreducibility of the Markov chain.
Additionally, under the same rank condition on the controllability matrix, we
prove that there is equivalence between the existence of a steadily attracting
state and the $\varphi$-irreducibility and aperiodicity of the chain. The
notion of steadily attracting state is new.
  Those results hold under considerably weaker assumptions on the model than
previous ones that would require $(x,u) \mapsto F(x,\alpha(x,u))$ to be
$C^\infty$ (while it can be discontinuous here). Additionally the establishment
of a necessary and sufficient condition for the $\varphi$-irreducibility and
aperiodicity without a structural assumption on the control set is novel---even
for Markov chains where $(x,u) \mapsto F(x,\alpha(x,u))$ is $C^\infty$.
  We illustrate that the conditions are easy to verify on a non-trivial and
non-artificial example of Markov chain arising in the context of adaptive
stochastic search algorithms to optimize continuous functions in a black-box
scenario.

from the decoupling limit of very large masses and vanishing mixing, as they
offer the best prospects for detection. We identify exotic chiral families that
may receive a mass from the Higgs only, still in agreement with the
$h\gamma\gamma$ signal strength. A mixing $\theta$ between the Standard Model
and non-chiral fermions induces order $\theta^2$ deviations in the Higgs
couplings. The mixing can be as large as $\theta\sim 0.5$ in case of custodial
protection of the $Z$ couplings or accidental cancellation in the oblique
parameters. We also notice some intriguing effects for much smaller values of
$\theta$, especially in the lepton sector. Our survey includes a number of
unconventional pairs of vector-like and Majorana fermions coupled through the
Higgs, that may induce order one corrections to the Higgs radiative couplings.
We single out the regions of parameters where $h\gamma\gamma$ and $hgg$ are
unaffected, while the $h\gamma Z$ signal strength is significantly modified,
turning a few times larger than in the Standard Model in two cases. The second

resolution galaxy simulation identified as continuous structures within a
contour, in the simulator's position-position-position (PPP) co-ordinate space
and the observer's position-position-velocity space (PPV). Results indicate
that the properties of the cloud populations are similar in both methods and up
to 70% of clouds have a single counterpart in the opposite data structure.
Comparing individual clouds in a one-to-one match reveals a scatter in
properties mostly within a factor of two. However, the small variations in
mass, radius and velocity dispersion produce significant differences in derived
quantities such as the virial parameter. This makes it difficult to determine
if a structure is truely gravitationally bound. The three cloud types
originally found in the simulation in Fujimoto et al. (2014) are identified in
both data sets, with around 80% of the clouds retaining their type between
identification methods. We also compared our results when using a peak
decomposition method to identify clouds in both PPP and PPV space. The number
of clouds increased with this technique, but the overall cloud properties
remained similar. However, the more crowded environment lowered the ability to
match clouds between techniques to 40%. The three cloud types also became
harder to separate, especially in the PPV data set. The method used for cloud
identification therefore plays a critical role in determining cloud properties,
but both PPP and PPV can potentially identify the same structures.

then holding on to them until the job completion. Such systems are in the core
of a variety of shared-resource allocation and synchronization systems. This
work opens a new perspective to study the expected job delay and throughput
analytically, given the possible set of jobs that may join the system
dynamically.
  We identify the system dependencies that cause contention among the threads
as they try to acquire the job objects. We use these observations to define the
shared-object system equilibria. We note that the system is in equilibrium
whenever the rate in which jobs arrive at the system matches the job completion
rate. These equilibria consider not only the job delay but also the job
throughput, as well as the time in which each thread blocks other threads in

cycles and, by using a graph representation of the problem, we are able to
propose procedures for finding and estimating equilibria, i.e., discovering the
job delay and throughput, as well as the blocking time.

better analytical tools for the problem, in order to estimate performance
measures similar to ones that can be acquired through experimentation on

averaging the pulsed measurements of the quadrature of the second TLR we show
how the temperature of the membrane can be determined. Moreover the statistical
description of the state of the membrane, which is directly accessed in this

version of a branch-and-bound based exact algorithm that has been originally
proposed to determine the maximum size clique for an entire network graph. We
then run this algorithm on two categories of complex networks: One category of
networks capture the evolution of small-world networks from regular network
(according to the wellknown Watts-Strogatz model) and their subsequent
evolution to random networks; we show that the distribution of the maximal
clique size of the vertices follows a Poisson-style distribution at different
stages of the evolution of the small-world network to a random network; on the
other hand, the maximal clique size of the vertices is observed to be
in-variant and to be very close to that of the maximum clique size for the
entire network graph as the regular network is transformed to a small-world
network. The second category of complex networks studied are real-world
networks (ranging from random networks to scale-free networks) and we observe
the maximal clique size of the vertices in five of the six real-world networks
to follow a Poisson-style distribution. In addition to the above case studies,
we also analyze the correlation between the maximal clique size and clustering
coefficient as well as analyze the assortativity index of the vertices with

coherence and entanglement, which allow quantum information and computation
processing. This achievement is however jeopardized by the detrimental effects
of the environment surrounding any quantum system, so that finding strategies
to protect quantum resources is essential. Non-Markovian and structured
environments are useful tools to this aim. Here we show how a simple
environmental architecture made of two coupled lossy cavities enables a switch
between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes for the dynamics of a qubit
embedded in one of the cavity. Furthermore, qubit coherence can be indefinitely
preserved if the cavity without qubit is perfect. We then focus on entanglement
control of two independent qubits locally subject to such an engineered
environment and discuss its feasibility in the framework of circuit quantum
electrodynamics. With up-to-date experimental parameters, we show that our
architecture allows entanglement lifetimes orders of magnitude longer than the
spontaneous lifetime without local cavity couplings. This cavity-based
architecture is straightforwardly extendable to many qubits for scalability.

Magellanic Cloud (SMC). A detailed X-ray study of this SNR with XMM-Newton
confirmed the presence of a hard X-ray source near its centre, indicating the
detection of the first composite SNR in the SMC. With a dedicated Chandra
observation we aim to resolve the point source and confirm its nature. We also
acquire new ATCA observations of the source at 2.1 GHz with improved flux
density estimates and resolution.
  Methods: We perform detailed spatial and spectral analysis of the source.
With the highest resolution X-ray and radio image of the centre of the SNR
available today, we resolve the source and confirm its pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
nature. Further, we constrain the geometrical parameters of the PWN and perform
spectral analysis for the point source and the PWN separately. We also test for
the radial variations of the PWN spectrum and its possible east west asymmetry.
  Results: The X-ray source at the centre of IKT 16 can be resolved into a
symmetrical elongated feature centering a point source, the putative pulsar.
Spatial modeling indicates an extent of 5.2 arcsec of the feature with its axis
inclined at 82 degree east from north, aligned with a larger radio feature
consisting of two lobes almost symmetrical about the X-ray source. The picture
is consistent with a PWN which has not yet collided with the reverse shock. The
point source is about three times brighter than the PWN and has a hard spectrum
of spectral index 1.1 compared to a value 2.2 for the PWN. This points to the
presence of a pulsar dominated by non-thermal emission. The expected E_{dot} is
~ 10^37 erg s^-1 and spin period < 100 ms. However, the presence of a compact
nebula unresolved by Chandra at the distance of the SMC cannot completely be
ruled out.

the available spectroscopic information. On the basis of three continuum

old stellar populations might bring a non-negligible contribution to IR
luminosity (LIR) and continuum reddening. Using Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-PACS
data we derive LIR for two-thirds of our sample. The LIR/LUV ratio is used as a
probe of effective attenuation (AIRX) to search for correlations with continuum
and spectroscopic features. The relation between AIRX and UV continuum slope
({\beta}) was tested for our sample and found to be broadly consistent with the
literature results at the same redshift, though with a larger dispersion with
respect to UV-selected samples. We find a correlation between the rest-frame
equivalent width (EW) of the [OII]{\lambda}3727 line and {\beta}, which is the
main result of this work. We therefore propose the [OII]{\lambda}3727 line EW
as a dust attenuation probe and calibrate it through AIRX, though the
assumption of a reddening curve is still needed to derive the actual
attenuation towards the [OII]{\lambda}3727 line. We tested the issue of
differential attenuation towards stellar continuum and nebular emission: our
results are in line with the traditional prescription of extra attenuation
towards nebular lines. A set of relations is provided that allows the recovery

temperature hot aqueous polymer solutions. During the sol-gel transition, such
materials may experience a volume contraction which is traditionally overlooked
as rheological measurements are usually performed in geometries of constant
volume. In this article, we revisit the formation of 1.5\% wt. agar gels
through a series of benchmark rheological experiments performed with a
plate-plate geometry. We demonstrate on that particular gel of polysaccharides
that the contraction associated with the sol/gel transition cannot be
neglected. Indeed, imposing a constant gap width during the gelation results in
the strain hardening of the sample, as evidenced by the large negative normal
force that develops. Such hardening leads to the slow drift in time of the gel
elastic modulus $G'$ towards ever larger values, and thus to an erroneous
estimate of $G'$. As an alternative, we show that imposing a constant normal
force equals to zero during the gelation, instead of a constant gap width,
suppresses the hardening as the decrease of the gap compensates for the sample
contraction. Using normal force controlled rheology, we then investigate the
impact of thermal history on 1.5\% wt. agar gels. We show that neither the
value of the cooling rate, nor the introduction of a constant temperature stage
during the cooling process influence the gel elastic properties. Instead, $G'$
only depends on the terminal temperature reached at the end of the cooling
ramp, as confirmed by direct imaging of the gel microstructure by cryoelectron
microscopy. The present work offers an extensive review of the technical
difficulties associated with the rheology of hydrogels and paves the way for a
systematic use of normal force controlled rheology to monitor non-isochoric

subspace the classification structure and the geometric characteristics induced
by an estimated Gaussian mixture model for discriminant analysis. In
particular, we consider the case of mixture of mixture models with varying
parametrization which allow for parsimonious models. The approach is an
extension of an existing work on reducing dimensionality for model-based
clustering based on Gaussian mixtures. Information on the dimension reduction
subspace is provided by the variation on class locations and, depending on the
estimated mixture model, on the variation on class dispersions. Projections
along the estimated directions provide summary plots which help to visualize
the structure of the classes and their characteristics. A suitable modification
of the method allows us to recover the most discriminant directions, i.e.,
those that show maximal separation among classes. The approach is illustrated
using simulated and real data.

However, collaborative filtering might lead to provide poor recommendation
because it does not rely on other useful available data such as users locations
and hence the accuracy of the recommendations could be very low and
inefficient. This could be very obvious in the systems that locations would
affect users preferences highly such as movie recommender systems. In this
paper a new location-based movie recommender system based on the collaborative

in consideration in the entire processing of the recommendations and peer

the construction of approximations in density functional theory. Using the
wavefunction for strictly-correlated electrons of a given density, we turn the
search over wavefunctions appearing in the original bound into a more
manageable search over electron densities. This allows us to challenge the
bound in a systematic way. We find that a maximizing density for the bound, if
it exists, must have compact support. We also find that, at least for particle
numbers $N\le 60$, a uniform density profile is not the most challenging for
the bound. With our construction we improve the bound for $N=2$ electrons that
was originally found by Lieb and Oxford, we give a new lower bound to the
constant appearing in the Lieb-Oxford inequality valid for any $N$, and we
provide an improved upper bound for the low-density uniform electron gas

as they provide a convenient means for users to log in at RPs and move much of
the burden of user authentication from RPs to IdPs.
  There is, however, a downside to current systems, as they do not respect
users' privacy: IdPs learn at which RP a user logs in. With one exception,
namely Mozilla's BrowserID system (a.k.a. Mozilla Persona), current SSO systems
were not even designed with user privacy in mind. Unfortunately, recently
discovered attacks, which exploit design flaws of BrowserID, show that
BrowserID does not provide user privacy either.
  In this paper, we therefore propose the first privacy-respecting SSO system
for the web, called SPRESSO (for Secure Privacy-REspecting Single Sign-On). The
system is easy to use, decentralized, and platform independent. It is based
solely on standard HTML5 and web features and uses no browser extensions,
plug-ins, or other executables.
  Existing SSO systems and the numerous attacks on such systems illustrate that
the design of secure SSO systems is highly non-trivial. We therefore also carry
out a formal analysis of SPRESSO based on an expressive model of the web in
order to formally prove that SPRESSO enjoys strong authentication and privacy

By constructing an asymptotic low-noise expansion of an upper bound to the
error probability of such a mismatched classifier, we provide sufficient
conditions for reliable classification in the low-noise regime that are able to
sharply predict the absence of a classification error floor. Such conditions
are a function of the geometry of the true signal distribution, the geometry of
the mismatched signal distributions as well as the interplay between such
geometries, namely, the principal angles and the overlap between the true and
the mismatched signal subspaces. Numerical results demonstrate that our

good framework to introduce a space and time or space time dependent number
scaling field. The effect of the scaling field on a few nonlocal physical and
geometric quantities is described. The effect on gauge theories is to introduce
a new complex scalar field into the derivatives appearing in Lagrangians. U(1)
invariance of Lagrangian terms does not affect the real part of the scaling
field. For this field, any mass is possible. The scaling field is also shown to
affect quantum wave packets and path lengths, and geodesic equations even on
flat space. Scalar fields described so far in physics, are possible candidates
for the scaling field. The lack of direct evidence for the field in physics
restricts the scaling field in that the gradient of the field must be close to
zero in a local region of cosmological space and time. There are no
restrictions outside the region. It is also seen that the scaling field does
not affect comparisons of computation or measurements outputs with one another.
However it does affect the assignment of numerical values to the outputs of
computations or measurements. These are needed because theory predictions are
in terms of numerical values.

real-world collective behavior, such as the contagious spread of fads and the
adoption of new technologies. A common property of those cascade models is that
a vanishingly small seed fraction can spread to a finite fraction of an
infinitely large network through local infections.
  In social and economic networks, however, individuals' behavior is often
influenced not only by what their direct neighbors are doing, but also by what
the majority of people are doing as a trend. A trend affects individuals'
behavior while individuals' behavior creates a trend.
  To analyze such a complex interplay between local- and global-scale
phenomena, I generalize the standard threshold model by introducing a new type
of node, called \textit{global nodes} (or \textit{trend followers}), whose
activation probability depends on a global-scale trend; specifically the
percentage of activated nodes in the population. The model shows that global
nodes play a role as accelerating cascades once a trend emerges while reducing
the probability of a trend emerging. Global nodes thus either facilitate or
inhibit cascades, suggesting that a moderate share of trend followers may
maximize the average size of cascades.

induction equation, represented by a partial differential equation with a

evolution of the energy release, of the system control parameter, of the event

Moreover, energetic initial impulses in the magnetohydrodynamic flow can lead
to one dimensional signatures in the magnetic two dimensional system, once the
Self Organized Critical regime is established. The applications of the model
for the study of Gamma Ray Bursts is briefly considered, and it is shown that
some astrophysical parameters of the bursts, like the light curves, the maximum

power transmission over long distance, with reduced transmission losses.
Besides the traditional high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) transmission,
with the advancement in power electronics, high-voltage direct current (HVDC)
transmission is increasingly becoming important. One of the main factors
impacting the transmission line parameters and the losses is the length of the
transmission line (overhead). In this paper, a concept of tuned high-voltage AC
line is presented for long (> 250 km) transmission line. A tuned line is where
the receiving-end voltage and current are numerically equal to the
corresponding sending-end values. This paper presents the detailed theoretical
analysis of the tuned HVAC line, suggesting adaptation of the transmission
frequency as per the length of the line. The simulation of a tuned HVAC line is
performed using the PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results for two different line
lengths, substantiate the theoretical analysis of reducing the reactive power
absorbed in the line, while increasing the active power transmission.

behavior of customers vary greatly from time to time, city to city, type to
type, etc. Generally, buildings are classified into residential, commercial and
industrial. This study is aimed to distinguish the types of residential
buildings in Singapore and establish a mathematical model to represent and
model the load profile of each type. Modeling household energy consumption is
the first step in exploring the possible demand response and load reduction
opportunities under the smart grid initiative. Residential electricity load
profiling includes the details on the electrical appliances, its energy
requirement, and consumption pattern. The model is generated with a bottom-up
load model. Simulation is performed for daily load profiles of 1 or 2 rooms, 3
rooms, 4 rooms and 5 rooms public housing. The simulated load profile is
successfully validated against the measured electricity consumption data, using
a web-based Customer Energy Portal (CEP) at the campus housings of Nanyang
Technological University, Singapore.

  2015",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  This paper presents a new theory of turbulent mixing in stirred reactors. The
degree of homogeneity of a mixed fluid may be characterized by the Kolmogorov
micro-scale. The smaller its value, the better homogeneity. The micro-scale
scales inversely with the fourth root of the energy dissipation rate in the
stirring process. The higher this rate, the smaller lambda, and the better the
homogeneity in the reactor. This is true for Newtonian fluids. In non-Newtonian
fluids the situation is different. For instance, in shear-thickening fluids it
is plausible that high shear rates thicken the fluid and might strangle the
mixing. The internal interactions between different fluid-mechanical and
colloidal variables are subtle, namely due to the (until recently) very limited
understanding of turbulence. Starting from a qualitatively new turbulence
theory for inviscid fluids [Baumert, 2013], giving e.g. the Karman constant as
$(2\pi)^{-1/2} = 0.40$ [the super-pipe in Princeton gave 0.40 p/m 0.02, Bailey
et al., 2014], we generalize this approach to the case of viscous fluids and
derive equations which in the steady state exhibit two solutions. One solution
branch describes a state of good mixing, the other a state of strangled
turbulence. The physical system cannot be in two different steady states at the
same time. But it is physically admissible to switch between the two steady
states by non-stationary transitions, maybe in a chaotic fashion.
