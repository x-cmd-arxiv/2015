solver for first order Newton Schulz iteration of the matrix square root and
inverse square root. The solver performs recursive two-sided metric queries on
a modified Cauchy-Schwarz criterion, culling negligible sub-volumes of the
product-tensor for problems with structured decay in the sub-space metric.
These sub-structures are shown to bound the relative error in the matrix-matrix
product, and in favorable cases, to enjoy a reduced computational complexity
governed by dimensionality reduction of the product volume. A main contribution
is demonstration of a new, algebraic locality that develops under contractive
identity iteration, with collapse of the metric-subspace onto the identity's
plane diagonal, resulting in a stronger $\tt SpAMM$ bound. Also, we carry out a
first order {Fr\'{e}chet} analyses for single and dual channel instances of the
square root iteration, and look at bifurcations due to ill-conditioning and a
too aggressive $\tt SpAMM$ approximation. Then, we show that extreme $\tt
SpAMM$ approximation and contractive identity iteration can be achieved for
ill-conditioned systems through regularization, and we demonstrate the
potential for acceleration with a scoping, product representation of the

solving first passage (FP) problem for the Rouse model, a simplest model of a
polymer chain. We show that this problem has to be treated as a
multi-dimensional Kramers' problem, which presents rich and unexpected
behavior. We first perform direct and forward-flux sampling (FFS) simulations,
and measure the mean first-passage time $\tau(z)$ for the free end to reach a
certain distance $z$ away from the origin. The results show that the mean FP
time is getting faster if the Rouse chain is represented by more beads. Two
scaling regimes of $\tau(z)$ are observed, with transition between them varying
as a function of chain length. We use these simulations results to test two
theoretical approaches. One is a well known asymptotic theory valid in the
limit of zero temperature. We show that this limit corresponds to fully
extended chain when each chain segment is stretched, which is not particularly
realistic. A new theory based on the well known Freidlin-Wentzell theory is
proposed, where dynamics is projected onto the minimal action path. The new
theory predicts both scaling regimes correctly, but fails to get the correct
numerical prefactor in the first regime. Combining our theory with the FFS
simulations lead us to a simple analytical expression valid for all extensions
and chain lengths. One of the applications of polymer FP problem occurs in the
context of branched polymer rheology. In this paper, we consider the
arm-retraction mechanism in the tube model, which maps exactly on the model we
have solved. The results are compared to the Milner-McLeish theory without
constraint release, which is found to overestimate FP time by a factor of 10 or
more.

caused by the oscillating electrostatic force that is coherent with the tip
oscillation, which is induced by a sinusoidally oscillating voltage applied
between the tip and sample. We analyzed the effect of the phase of the
oscillating force on the frequency shift and dissipation and found that the
relative phase of 90$^\circ$ that causes only the dissipation is the most
appropriate for KPFM measurements. The present technique requires a
significantly smaller ac voltage amplitude by virtue of enhanced force
detection due to the resonance enhancement and the use of fundamental flexural

derived directly from observations. We performed numerical 3D simulations with
the RAMSES code. The initial density structure has been directly taken from
$^{12}$CO emission data, adding an additional dense cloud, which, when it is
shocked, causes the bright emission feature. From parameter studies we obtained
the position $(\ell , b)=(109.1545^\circ , -1.0078^\circ)$ for an elliptical
cloud with $n_\text{cloud}=25~\text{cm}^{-3}$ based on the preshock density
from Chandra data and a maximum diameter of 4.54 pc, whose encounter with the
supernova (SN) shock wave generates the bright X-ray emission inside the SNR.
The calculated age of the remnant is about 11,000 yr according to our
simulations. In addition, we can also determine the most probable site of the
SN explosion. Hydrodynamic simulations can reproduce the morphology and the
observed size of the SNR CTB 109 remarkably well. Moreover, the simulations
show that it is very plausible that the bright X-ray emission inside the SNR is
the result of an elliptical dense cloud shocked by the SN explosion wave. We
show that numerical simulations using observational data for an initial model

sheared, mixed, or left to flow, grains tend to separate by sizes in a process
known as size segregation.
  In this study, we explore the size segregation mechanism in granular chute
flows in terms of pressure distribution and granular micro-structure.
Therefore, 2D discrete numerical simulations of bi-disperse granular chute
flows are systematically analysed. Based on the theoretical models by Gray and
Thornton 2005 and Hill and Tan 2014, we explore the stress partition in the
phases of small and large grains, discriminating between contact stresses and
kinetic stresses. Our results support both gravity-induced and
shear-gradient-induced segregation mechanisms. However, we show that the
contact stress partition is extremely sensitive to the definition of the
partial stress tensors, and more specifically, to the way mixed contacts (i.e.
involving a small grain and a large grain) are handled, making conclusions on
gravity-induced segregation uncertain.
  By contrast, the computation of the partial kinetic stress tensors is robust.
Kinetic pressure partition exhibits a deviation from continuum mixture theory
of a significantly larger amplitude than contact pressure, and display a clear
dependence on the flow dynamics. Finally, using a simple approximation for the
contact partial stress tensors, we investigate how contact stress partition
relates with the flow micro-structure, and suggest that the latter may provide
an interesting proxy for studying gravity-induced segregation.

the gravitational edge detection technique with the well-established one
proposed by Canny, as well as with a recent multiscale fuzzy-based technique
proposed by Lopez-Molina et Alejandro We also address the issues of aggregation
of gray level images before and after edge detection and of filtering. All
techniques addressed here are applied to a mosaic built using class
distributions obtained from a real scene, as well as to the true PolSAR image;
the mosaic results are assessed using Baddeley's Delta Metric. Our experiments
show that modifying the gravitational edge detection technique with a
non-standard neighbourhood configuration produces better results than the
original technique, as well as the other techniques used for comparison. The
experiments show that adapting edge detection methods from Computational
Intelligence for use in PolSAR imagery is a new field worthy of exploration.

  in JMLR",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Divide-and-conquer based methods for Bayesian inference provide a general
approach for tractable posterior inference when the sample size is large. These
methods divide the data into smaller subsets, sample from the posterior
distribution of parameters in parallel on all the subsets, and combine
posterior samples from all the subsets to approximate the full data posterior
distribution. The smaller size of any subset compared to the full data implies
that posterior sampling on any subset is computationally more efficient than
sampling from the true posterior distribution. Since the combination step takes
negligible time relative to sampling, posterior computations can be scaled to
massive data by dividing the full data into a sufficiently large number of data
subsets. One such approach relies on the geometry of posterior distributions
estimated across different subsets and combines them through their barycenter
in a Wasserstein space of probability measures. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the accuracy of approximation that are valid in many
applications. We show that the geometric method approximates the full data
posterior distribution better than its competitors across diverse simulations
and reproduces known results when applied to a movie ratings database.

motivation of the presented analysis is experimental demonstrations of
hyper-diffusive spreading of a wave packet in random photonic lattices [L. Levi
\textit{et al.}, Nature Phys. \textbf{8}, 912 (2012)]. A rigorous
quantum-mechanical calculation of the mean probability amplitude is suggested,
and it is shown that the power law spreading of the mean squared displacement
(MSD) is $< x^2(t)>\sim t^{\alpha}$, where $2<\alpha\leq 3$. The values of the
transport exponent $\alpha$ depend on the correlation properties of the random
potential $V(x,t)$, which describes random inhomogeneities of the medium. In
particular, when the random potential is $\delta$ correlated in time, the
quantum wave packet spreads according Richardson turbulent diffusion with the
MSD $\sim t^3$. Hyper-diffusion with $\alpha=12/5$ is also obtained for
arbitrary correlation properties of the random potential.

parameter estimation problems. When posed as a nonlinear least squares problem
fitting a model to data, the cost of each iteration grows linearly with the
amount of data and it can easily become prohibitively expensive to perform many
iterations. Here we develop an approach that projects the data onto a
low-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional data that preserves the
information in the original data. We provide results from both optimization and
statistical perspectives showing that the information is preserved when the
subspace angles between this projection and the Jacobian of the model at the
current iterate remain small. However, for this approach to reduce
computational complexity, both the projected model and Jacobian must be
computed inexpensively. This is a constraint on the pairs of models and
subspaces for which this approach provides a computational speedup. Here we
consider the exponential fitting problem projected onto the range of
Vandermonde matrix, for which the projected model and Jacobian can be computed
in closed form using a generalized geometric sum formula. We further provide an
inexpensive heuristic that picks this Vandermonde matrix so that the subspace
angles with the Jacobian remain small and use this heuristic to update the
subspace during optimization. Although the asymptotic cost still depends on the
data dimension, the overall cost of this sequence of projected nonlinear least
squares problems is less expensive than the original nonlinear least squares
problem. Applied to the exponential fitting problem, this provides an algorithm
that is not only faster in the limit of large data than the conventional
nonlinear least squares approach, but is also faster than subspace based
approaches such as HSVD.

different bases of effective field theory operators. We present the main
functions of the program and provide an example of usage. One of the
Lagrangians which Rosetta can translate into has been implemented into
FeynRules, which allows Rosetta to be interfaced into various high-energy
physics programs such as Monte Carlo event generators. In addition to popular
bases choices, such as the Warsaw and Strongly Interacting Light Higgs bases
already implemented in the program, we also detail how to add new operator
bases into the Rosetta package. In this way, phenomenological studies using an
effective field theory framework can be straightforwardly performed.

  Wireless Networks with Frequency-Reuse","Accepted for publication in IEEE Transaction on Wireless
  Communications (TWC)",,"10.1109/TWC.2015.2474864",,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, joint designs of data routes and resource allocations are
developed for generic half-duplex multicarrier wireless networks in which each
subcarrier can be reused by multiple links. Two instances are considered. The
first instance pertains to the general case in which each subcarrier can be
timeshared by multiple links, whereas the second instance pertains to a special
case in which time-sharing is not allowed and a subcarrier, once assigned to a
set of links, is used by those links throughout the signalling interval. Novel
frameworks are developed to optimize the joint design of data routes,
subcarrier schedules and power allocations. These design problems are nonconvex
and hence difficult to solve. To circumvent this difficulty, efficient
techniques based on geometric programming are developed to obtain locally
optimal solutions. Numerical results show that the designs developed in both
instances yield performance that is superior to that of their counterparts in
which frequency-reuse is not allowed.

acoustic oscillations (BAO), and supernovae Ia (SNe-Ia) support a constant dark
energy equation of state with $w_0 \sim -1$. Measuring the evolution of $w$
along the redshift is one of the most demanding challenges for observational
cosmology. Aims: We discuss the existence of a close relation for GRBs, named
Combo-relation, based on characteristic parameters of GRB phenomenology such as
the prompt intrinsic peak energy $E_{p,i}$, the X-ray afterglow, the initial
luminosity of the shallow phase $L_0$, the rest-frame duration $\tau$ of the
shallow phase, and the index of the late power-law decay $\alpha_X$. We use it
to measure $\Omega_m$ and the evolution of the dark energy equation of state.
We also propose a new calibration method for the same relation, which reduces
the dependence on SNe Ia systematics. Methods: We have selected a sample of
GRBs with 1) a measured redshift $z$; 2) a determined intrinsic prompt peak
energy $E_{p,i}$, and 3) a good coverage (0.3-10) keV afterglow light curves.
The fitting technique of the rest.frame (0.3-10) keV luminosity light curves
represents the core of the Combo-relation. We separate the early steep decay,
considered a part of the prompt emission, from the X-ray afterglow additional
component. Data with the largest positive residual, identified as flares, are
automatically eliminated until the p-value of the fit becomes greater than 0.3.
Results: We strongly minimize the dependency of the Combo-GRB calibration on
SNe Ia. We also measure a small extra-Poissonian scatter of the Combo-relation,
which allows us to infer from GRBs alone $\Omega_M =0.29^{+0.23}_{-0.15}$
(1$\sigma$) for the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, and $\Omega_M
=0.40^{+0.22}_{-0.16}$, $w_0 = -1.43^{+0.78}_{-0.66}$ for the flat-Universe
variable equation of state case.

extended to characterizing graphs that are maximal with respect to

the Tunguska event in 1908. Lacking proper astrometric observations, the
pre-impact orbit of this object has been determined using videos, satellite
images, and pure geometry. Unfortunately, more than two years after the event,
the published estimates vary so much that there is no clear orbital solution
that could be used to investigate the origin of the impactor and the existence
of dynamically, or perhaps even genetically, related asteroids. Here, we
revisit this topic using a full N-body approach. A robust statistical test is
applied to published solutions to discard those unable to produce a virtual
impact at the observed time (03:20:20.8 s UTC). The same N-body methodology and
the latest ephemerides are used to compute a new orbital solution: a=1.6247 AU,
e=0.5318, i=3.9750 degrees, Omega=326.4607 degrees and omega=109.7012 degrees.
This new solution --which has an impact probability > 0.99999 and uncertainties
in time and space of 0.2 s and 6 km, respectively-- is utilized to explore the
past orbital evolution of the impactor as well as the presence of near-Earth
objects moving in similar paths. A dynamical link between asteroid 2011 EO40

extensively explored.

because disorder is considered detrimental to many important physical
properties. Here we challenge this paradigm by showing that particular types of
strongly-correlated disorder can give rise to useful characteristics that are
inaccessible to ordered states. A judicious combination of low-symmetry
building unit and high-symmetry topological template leads to aperiodic
""procrystalline"" solids that harbour this type of topological disorder. We
identify key classes of procrystalline states together with their
characteristic diffraction behaviour, and establish a variety of mappings onto
known and target materials. Crucially, the strongly-correlated disorder we
consider is associated with specific sets of modulation periodicities
distributed throughout the Brillouin zone. Lattice dynamical calculations
reveal selective disorder-phonon coupling to lattice vibrations characterised
by these same periodicities. The principal effect on the phonon spectrum is to
bring about dispersion in energy rather than wave-vector, as in the
poorly-understood ""waterfall"" effect observed in relaxor ferroelectrics. This
property of procrystalline solids suggests a mechanism by which
strongly-correlated topological disorder might allow new and useful
functionalities, including independently-optimised thermal and electronic
transport behaviour as required for high-performance thermoelectrics.

interesting geometric motivation. DWD was originally proposed as a superior
alternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be
popular compared with the SVM. The main reasons are twofold. First, the
state-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone
programming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is
much more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD
mainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting
and data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the
Bayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency
of DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work,
we advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and
theoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving
DWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing
state-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can
handle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a
special DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural
kernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes
risk consistency of the kernel DWD. We compare DWD and the SVM on several
benchmark data sets and show that the two have comparable classification
accuracy, but DWD equipped with our new algorithm can be much faster to compute
than the SVM.

the real-time diagrammatic technique in the sequential tunneling regime. We
study the dependence of the Andreev current, the differential conductance, and
the tunnel magnetoresistance on various parameters of the model in both the
linear and nonlinear response regimes. In particular, we analyze the
spin-resolved transport in the crossed Andreev reflection regime, where a
blockade of the current occurs due to enhanced occupation of the triplet state.
We show that in the triplet blockade, finite intradot correlations can lead to
considerable leakage current due to direct Andreev reflection processes.
Furthermore, we find additional regimes of current suppression resulting from
enhanced occupation of singlet states, which decreases the rate of crossed
Andreev reflection.We also study how the splitting of Andreev bound states,
triggered by either dot level detuning, finite hopping between the dots, or
finite magnetic field, affects the Andreev current. While in the first two
cases the number of Andreev bound states is doubled, whereas transport
properties are qualitatively similar, in the case of finite magnetic field
further level splitting occurs, leading to a nontrivial behavior of
spin-resolved transport characteristics, and especially that of tunneling
magnetoresistance. Finally, we discuss the entanglement fidelity between split
Cooper pair electrons and show that by tuning the device parameters, fidelity
can reach unity.

Between 2002 and 2014, we obtained 63 nights of near-infrared (0.67-2.55
$\mu$m) spectra using the SpeX instrument at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF). Triton has spectral features in this wavelength region from N$_2$, CO,
CH$_4$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O. Absorption features of ethane (C$_2$H$_6$) and
$^{13}$CO are coincident at 2.405 $\mu$m, a feature that we detect in our
spectra. We calculated the integrated band area (or fractional band depth in
the case of H$_2$O) in each nightly average spectrum, constructed longitudinal
distributions, and quantified temporal evolution for each of the chosen
absorption bands. The volatile ices (N$_2$, CO, CH$_4$) show significant
variability over one Triton rotation and have well-constrained longitudes of
peak absorption. The non-volatile ices (CO$_2$, H$_2$O) show poorly-constrained
peak longitudes and little variability. The longitudinal distribution of the
2.405 $\mu$m band shows little variability over one Triton rotation and is
97$\pm$44$^{\circ}$ and 92$\pm$44$^{\circ}$ out of phase with the 1.58 $\mu$m
and 2.35 $\mu$m CO bands, respectively. This evidence indicates that the 2.405
$\mu$m band is due to absorption from non-volatile ethane. CH$_4$ absorption
increased over the period of the observations while absorption from all other
ices showed no statistically signifcant change. We conclude from these results
that the southern latitudes of Triton are currently dominated by non-volatile
ices and as the sub-solar latitude migrates northwards, a larger quantity of
volatile ice is coming into view.

determine a lag with certainty, with the most likely value being around zero

range from 10 to 20 days, with the near-IR following the optical variations.
Filtering the light curves in frequency space shows that the strongest

the nature of the X-ray variability and conclude that this is intrinsic and
cannot be accounted for by absorption episodes due to material intervening in

insufficient to completely offset cooling. A model-subtracted residual X-ray

feedback roughly 100 Myr ago. This residual image also exhibits significant
asymmetry in the inner ~200 kpc (0.15R500), reminiscent of infalling cool
clouds, either due to minor mergers or fragmentation of the cooling ICM. Taken
together, these data reveal a rapidly evolving cool core which is rich with

helium enhanced second generation stars (G2) in the classical bulge component

the observed double RC. In a composite bulge, where a classical bulge can
coexist with a boxy pseudo bulge, our models can also reproduce key

M_sun and the secondary has a mass of 0.44 \pm 0.05 M_sun. The recently updated

luminous type-1 Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 with unprecedented high resolution
(0.5$""$ $\times$ 0.4$""$ = 165 pc $\times$ 132 pc) at submillimeter wavelengths.
Utilizing the wide-bandwidth of ALMA, we simultaneously obtained HCN(4-3),
HCO$^+$(4-3), CS(7-6), and partially CO(3-2) line maps, as well as the 860
$\mu$m continuum. The region consists of the central $\sim$ 1$""$ component and
the surrounding starburst ring with a radius of $\sim$ 1.5$""$-2.5$""$. Several
structures connect these components. Except for CO(3-2), these dense gas
tracers are significantly concentrated towards the central $\sim$ 1$""$,
suggesting their suitability to probe the nuclear regions of galaxies. Their
spatial distribution resembles well those of centimeter and mid-infrared
continuum emissions, but it is anti-correlated with the optical one, indicating
the existence of dust obscured star formation. The integrated intensity ratios
of HCN(4-3)/HCO$^+$(4-3) and HCN(4-3)/CS(7-6) are higher at the AGN position
than at the starburst ring, which is consistent to our previous findings
(submm-HCN enhancement). However, the HCN(4-3)/HCO$^+$(4-3) ratio at the AGN
position of NGC 7469 (1.11$\pm$0.06) is almost half of the corresponding value
of the low-luminosity type-1 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1097 (2.0$\pm$0.2), despite the
more than two orders of magnitude higher X-ray luminosity of NGC 7469. But the
ratio is comparable to that of the close vicinity of the AGN of NGC 1068
($\sim$ 1.5). Based on these results, we speculate that some other heating
mechanisms than X-ray (e.g., mechanical heating due to AGN jet) can contribute
significantly for shaping the chemical composition in NGC 1097.

have stimulated debate about the nature of reality. In his seminal work, John
Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can
reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local
realist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an
inequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to
quantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the
fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades,
numerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because
of experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional
assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in
loopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such
additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's
inequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of
high-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin
readout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use
of fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation
of 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials
testing the CHSH-Bell inequality $S \leq 2$ and find $S = 2.42 \pm 0.20$. A
null hypothesis test yields a probability of $p = 0.039$ that a local-realist
model for space-like separated sites produces data with a violation at least as
large as observed, even when allowing for memory in the devices. This result
rules out large classes of local realist theories, and paves the way for
implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness
certification.

vacuum entanglement entropies in 1+1 dimension and we find a transition between
logarithmic and linear scaling of the entropy, which is the expected 1+1

  Application to weakly chaotic orbits in barred galaxies","17 pages, 12 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Owing to the pioneering work of Contopoulos, a strongly barred galaxy is
known to have irregular orbits in the vicinity of the bar. By definition,
irregular orbits can not be represented by action-angle tori everywhere in
phase space. This thwarts perturbation theory and complicates our understanding
of their role in galaxy structure and evolution. This paper provides a
qualitative introduction to a new method based on KAM theory for investigating
the morphology of regular and irregular orbits based on direct computation of
tori described in Paper 1 and applies it to a galaxy disc bar. Using this
method, we find that much of the phase space inside of the bar radius becomes
chaotic for strong bars, excepting a small region in phase space between the
ILR and corotation resonances for orbits of moderate ellipticity. This helps
explain the preponderance of moderately eccentric bar-supporting orbits as the
bar strength increases. This also suggests that bar strength may be limited by
chaos! The chaos results from stochastic layers that form around primary
resonances owing to separatrix splitting. Most investigations of orbit
regularity are performed using numerical computation of Lyapunov exponents or
related indices. We show that Lyapunov exponents poorly diagnose the degree of
stochasticity in this problem; the island structure in the stochastic sheaths
allow orbit to change morphology while presenting anomalously small Lyapunov
exponent values (i.e. weak chaos). For example, a weakly chaotic orbit may
appear to change its morphology spontaneously, while appearing regular except
during the change itself. The numerical KAM approach sensitively detects these
dynamics and provides a model Hamiltonian for further investigation. It may
underpredict the number of broken tori for strong perturbations.

We calculate the nucleosynthetic yields for three \snia simulations, assuming
single degenerate, Chandrasekhar mass progenitors, for a wide range of
progenitor metallicities, and calculate synthetic light curves and spectra to
explore correlations between progenitor metallicity and the strength of
spectral features. We use two 2D simulations of the
deflagration-detonation-transition scenario with different $^{56}$Ni yields and
the W7 simulation to control for differences between explosion models and total
yields. While the overall yields of intermediate mass elements (16 $<$ A $\leq$
40) differ between the three cases, trends in the yields are similar. With
increasing metallicity, $^{28}$Si yields remain nearly constant, $^{40}$Ca
yields decline, and Ti and $^{54}$Fe yields increase. In the synthetic spectra,
we identify two features at 30 days post explosion that appear to deepen with
progenitor metallicity: a Ti feature around 4200\,\AA\ and a Fe feature around
5200\,\AA\@. In all three simulations, their pseudo equivalent widths show a
systematic trend with progenitor metallicity. This suggests that these two
features may allow differentiation among progenitor metallicities of observed

between fundamental science and applications, and the need to foster both
aspects to advance either one. For instance, the possibility to distribute
entangled photons over tens or even hundreds of kilometers is fascinating
because it confirms the quantum predictions over large distances, while quantum
theory is often presented to apply to the very small (see Figure 1). On the
other hand, entanglement enables quantum key distribution (QKD) [1]. This most
advanced application of quantum information processing allows one to distribute
cryptographic keys in a provably secure manner. For this, one merely has to
measure the two halves of an entangled pair of photons. Surprisingly, and being
of both fundamental and practical interest, the use of entanglement removes
even the necessity for trusting most equipment used for the measurements [5].
Furthermore, entanglement serves as a resource for quantum teleportation (see
Figure 2) [1]. In turn, this provides a tool for extending quantum key
distribution to arbitrarily large distances and building large-scale networks
that connect future quantum computers and atomic clocks [6]. In the following,
we describe the counter-intuitive properties of entangled particles as well as
a few recent experiments that address fundamental and applied aspects of
quantum teleportation. While a lot of work is being done using different
quantum systems, including trapped ions, color centers in diamond, quantum
dots, and superconducting circuits, we will restrict ourselves to experiments

odd-even staggering effects in both variables. The approach is to use Brownian
shape-motion on a macroscopic-microscopic potential-energy surface which, for a
particular compound system is calculated versus four shape variables:
elongation (quadrupole moment $Q_2$), neck $d$, left nascent fragment
spheroidal deformation $\epsilon_{\rm f1}$, right nascent fragment deformation
$\epsilon_{\rm f2}$ and two asymmetry variables, namely proton and neutron
numbers in each of the two fragments. The extension of previous models 1)
introduces a method to calculate this generalized potential-energy function and
2) allows the correlated transfer of nucleon pairs in one step, in addition to
sequential transfer. In the previous version the potential energy was
calculated as a function of $Z$ and $N$ of the compound system and its shape,
including the asymmetry of the shape. We outline here how to generalize the
model from the ""compound-system"" model to a model where the emerging fragment
proton and neutron numbers also enter, over and above the compound system

models, from low-amplitude, multi-armed galaxies to Milky Way-like disks, to
estimate the vertical action of ensembles of stars in an axisymmetric
potential. In the multi-armed galaxy the low-amplitude arms represent tiny
perturbations of the potential, hence the vertical action for a set of stars is
conserved, although after several orbital periods of revolution the
conservation degrades significantly. For a Milky Way-like galaxy with vigorous
spiral activity and the formation of a bar, our results show that the potential
is far from steady, implying that the action is not a constant of motion.
Furthermore, because of the presence of high-amplitude arms and the bar,
considerable in-plane and vertical heating occurs that forces stars to deviate
from near-circular orbits, reducing the degree at which the actions are
conserved for individual stars, in agreement with previous results, but also
for ensembles of stars. If confirmed, this result has several implications,
including the assertion that the thick disk of our Galaxy forms by radial
migration of stars, under the assumption of the conservation of the action
describing the vertical motion of stars.

defined to be the set of all elements of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ whose forward orbits

Part I showed that upper bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional

above, in cases where all $M_i$ are powers of $2$. These intersection sets were
shown to be fractals whose points have $3$-adic expansions describable by
labeled paths in a finite automaton, whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly
computable and is of the form $\log_3(\beta)$ where $\beta$ is a real algebraic
integer. It gave algorithms for determination of the automaton, and computed

new infinite families of examples, illustrating interesting behavior of the

microarchitecture, called mean node strength (NdStr), which is part of a newly
developed approach called long range node-strut analysis. Our general aim is to
describe and quantify the apparent ""latticelike"" microarchitecture of the
trabecular bone network.
  Methods: Similar in some ways to the topological node-strut analysis
introduced by Garrahan et al. [J. Microsc. 142, 341-349 (1986)], our method is
distinguished by an emphasis on long-range trabecular connectivity. Thus, while
the topological classification of a pixel (after skeletonization) as a node,
strut, or terminus, can be determined from the 3x3 neighborhood of that pixel,
our method, which does not involve skeletonization, takes into account a much
larger neighborhood. In addition, rather than giving a discrete classification
of each pixel as a node, strut, or terminus, our method produces a continuous
variable, node strength. The node strength is averaged over a region of
interest to produce the mean node strength of the region.
  Results: We have applied our long range node-strut analysis to a set of 26
high-resolution ... The Nd/Tm ratios were computed using traditional
histomorphometry performed on bone biopsies obtained at the same location as
the pQCT scans.
  Conclusions: The newly introduced morphometric measure allows a quantitative
assessment of the long-range connectivity of trabecular bone. One advantage of
this method is that it is based on pQCT images that can be obtained
noninvasively from patients, i.e., without having to obtain a bone biopsy from
the patient.

electron-collecting area be sufficiently smaller ($\sqrt{2.3m_e/M}$ times) than
the ion-collecting area. They are commonly thought to be local phenomena that
collect the random thermal electron current, but do not otherwise perturb a
plasma. Here, using experiments on an electrode embedded in a wall,
particle-in-cell simulations and theory, it is shown that under low temperature
plasma conditions ($T_e \gg T_i$) electron sheaths are far from local. Instead,
a long presheath region (in excess of 70 $\lambda_D$) extends into the plasma
where electrons are accelerated via a pressure gradient to a flow speed
exceeding the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This fast flow is
found to excite instabilities, causing strong fluctuations near the sheath
edge.

By using a multiscale approach, i.e. first-principles density functional theory
combined with atomistic spin dynamics, we report here on the very intricate
structural and magnetic nature of amorphous Gd-Fe alloys for a wide range of Gd
and Fe atomic concentrations at the nanoscale level. Both structural and
dynamical properties of Gd-Fe alloys reported in this work are in good
agreement with previous experiments. We calculated the dynamic behavior of
homogeneous and inhomogeneous amorphous Gd-Fe alloys and their response under
the influence of a femtosecond laser pulse. In the homogeneous sample, the Fe
sublattice switches its magnetization before the Gd one. However, the temporal
sequence of the switching of the two sublattices is reversed in the
inhomogeneous sample. We propose a possible explanation based on a mechanism
driven by a combination of the Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya interaction and exchange
frustration, modeled by an antiferromagnetic second-neighbour exchange
interaction between Gd atoms in the Gd-rich region. We also report on the
influence of laser fluence and damping effects in the all-thermal switching.

specifying the covariance function of the random field. A practitioner working
with spatial data is presented a number of choices regarding the structure of
the dependence between observations. One of these choices is determining
whether or not an isotropic covariance function is appropriate. Isotropy
implies that spatial dependence does not depend on the direction of the spatial
separation between sampling locations. Misspecification of isotropy properties
(directional dependence) can lead to misleading inferences, e.g., inaccurate
predictions and parameter estimates. A researcher may use graphical
diagnostics, such as directional sample variograms, to decide whether the
assumption of isotropy is reasonable. These graphical techniques can be
difficult to assess, open to subjective interpretations, and misleading.
Hypothesis tests of the assumption of isotropy may be more desirable. To this
end, a number of tests of directional dependence have been developed using both
the spatial and spectral representations of random fields. We provide an
overview of nonparametric methods available to test the hypotheses of isotropy
and symmetry in spatial data. We summarize test properties, discuss important
considerations and recommendations in choosing and implementing a test, compare
several of the methods via a simulation study, and propose a number of open
research questions. Several of the reviewed methods can be implemented in R

design of a variety of optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and quantum information
devices. An efficient and optimized performance of these devices demands
engineering of the electronic and optical properties of the underlying QDMs.
The application of electric fields offers a knob to realise such control over
the QDM characteristics for a desired device operation. We perform
multi-million-atom atomistic tight-binding calculations to study the influence
of electric fields on the electron and hole wave function confinements and
symmetries, the ground-state transition energies, the band-gap wavelengths, and
the optical transition modes. The electrical fields both parallel ($\vec{E_p}$)
and anti-parallel ($\vec{E_a}$) to the growth direction are investigated to
provide a comprehensive guide on the understanding of the electric field
effects. The strain-induced asymmetry of the hybridized electron states is
found to be weak and can be balanced by applying a small $\vec{E_a}$ electric
field, of the order of 1 KV/cm. The strong interdot couplings completely break
down at large electric fields, leading to single QD states confined at the
opposite edges of the QDM. This mimics a transformation from a type-I band
structure to a type-II band structure for the QDMs, which is a critical
requirement for the design of intermediate-band solar cells (IBSC). The
analysis of the field-dependent ground-state transition energies reveal that
the QDM can be operated both as a high dipole moment device by applying large
electric fields and as a high polarizibility device under the application of
small electric field magnitudes. [abstract is truncated to fit the character

from the Apollo 14, 16, and 17 landing sites indicate that retention of
radiogenic 40Ar is a strong function of post-formation thermal history in the
lunar regolith, size, and chemical composition. Based on the relationships
presented in this paper, lunar impact glasses with compositions and sizes
sufficient to have retained 90% of their radiogenic Ar during 750 Ma of cosmic
ray exposure at time-integrated temperatures of up to 290 K have been
identified and are likely to have yielded reliable 40Ar/39Ar ages of formation.
Additionally, ~50% of the identified impact glass spheres have formation ages
of <500 Ma, while ~75% of the identified lunar impact glass shards and spheres
have ages of formation <2000 Ma. The observed age-frequency distribution of
lunar impact glasses may reflect two processes: (i) diminished preservation due
to spontaneous shattering with age; and (ii) preservation of a remnant
population of impact glasses from the tail end of the terminal lunar
bombardment having 40Ar/39Ar ages up to 3800 Ma. A protocol is described for

regression analysis is the multiple linear expectile regression proposed by
Newey and Powell in 1987. The growing applications of expectile regression
motivate us to develop a much more flexible nonparametric multiple expectile

called KERE which has multiple advantages over the classical multiple linear
expectile regression by incorporating non-linearity, non-additivity and complex
interactions in the final estimator. The kernel learning theory of KERE is
established. We develop an efficient algorithm inspired by
majorization-minimization principle for solving the entire solution path of
KERE. It is shown that the algorithm converges at least at a linear rate.
Extensive simulations are conducted to show the very competitive finite sample

taken both of the nonlinear advection of the perturbed particle distribution by
fluctuating ExB flows and of its phase mixing, which is caused by the streaming
of the particles along the mean magnetic field and, in a linear problem, would
lead to Landau damping. It is found that it is possible to construct a
consistent theory in which very little free energy leaks into high velocity
moments of the distribution function, rendering the turbulent cascade in the
energetically relevant part of the wave-number space essentially fluid-like.
The velocity-space spectra of free energy expressed in terms of Hermite-moment
orders are steep power laws and so the free-energy content of the phase space
does not diverge at infinitesimal collisionality (while it does for a linear
problem); collisional heating due to long-wavelength perturbations vanishes in
this limit (also in contrast with the linear problem, in which it occurs at the
finite rate equal to the Landau-damping rate). The ability of the free energy
to stay in the low velocity moments of the distribution function is facilitated
by the ""anti-phase-mixing"" effect, whose presence in the nonlinear system is
due to the stochastic version of the plasma echo (the advecting velocity
couples the phase-mixing and anti-phase-mixing perturbations). The partitioning
of the wave-number space between the (energetically dominant) region where this
is the case and the region where linear phase mixing wins its competition with
nonlinear advection is governed by the ""critical balance"" between linear and
nonlinear timescales (which for high Hermite moments splits into two
thresholds, one demarcating the wave-number region where phase mixing
predominates, the other where plasma echo does).

function, i.e. each functional group is associated with an optimal size.
However, comparative genomics revealed that proteins length may be affected by
additional factors. In 2002 it was shown that in bacterium Escherichia coli and
the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, protein sequences with no homologs are, on
average, shorter than those with homologs. Most experts now agree that the
length distributions are distinctly different between protein sequences with
and without homologs in bacterial and archaeal genomes. In this study, we
examine this postulate by a comprehensive analysis of all annotated prokaryotic
genomes and focusing on certain exceptions.
  Results: We compared lengths distributions of having homologs proteins (HHPs)
and non-having homologs proteins (orphans or ORFans) in all currently annotated
completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. As expected, the HHPs and ORFans have
strikingly different length distributions in almost all genomes. As previously
established, the HHPs, indeed, are, on average, longer than the ORFans, and the
length distributions for the ORFans have a relatively narrow peak, in contrast
to the HHPs, whose lengths spread over a wider range of values. However, about
thirty genomes do not obey these rules. Practically all genomes of Mycoplasma
and Ureaplasma have atypical ORFans distributions, with the mean lengths of
ORFan larger than the mean lengths of HHPs. These genera constitute over 80% of
atypical genomes.
  Conclusions: We confirmed on a ubiquitous set of genomes the previous
observation that HHPs and ORFans have different gene length distributions. We
also showed that Mycoplasmataceae genomes have distinctive distributions of
ORFans lengths. We offer several possible biological explanations of this
phenomenon.

(maximally recurrent) waves are clearly separated from marginally breaking
waves by their normalised energy fluxes localized near the crest region. On the
surface, this reduces to the local ratio of the energy flux velocity (here the
fluid velocity) to the crest point velocity for the tallest wave in the
evolving group. This provides a robust threshold parameter for breaking onset
for 2D and 3D wave packets propagating in uniform water depths from deep to
intermediate. Warning of imminent breaking onset was found to be detected up to
a fifth of a carrier wave period prior to a breaking event.

Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic
observations, to visualize solar flare emission as a function of spectral
component (e.g., isothermal temperature) rather than energy. This
computationally inexpensive technique is applicable to all spatially-invariant
spectral forms and is useful for visualizing spectroscopically-determined
individual sources and placing them in context, e.g., comparing multiple
isothermal sources with nonthermal emission locations. For example, while
extreme ultraviolet images can usually be closely identified with narrow
temperature ranges, due to the emission being primarily from spectral lines of
specific ion species, X-ray images are dominated by continuum emission and
therefore have a broad temperature response, making it difficult to identify
sources of specific temperatures regardless of the energy band of the image. We
combine RHESSI calibrated X-ray visibilities with spatially-integrated spectral
models including multiple isothermal components to effectively isolate the
individual thermal sources from the combined emission and image them
separately. We apply this technique to the 2002 July 23 X4.8 event studied in
prior works, and image for the first time the super-hot and cooler thermal
sources independently. The super-hot source is farther from the footpoints and
more elongated throughout the impulsive phase, consistent with an in situ
heating mechanism for the super-hot plasma.

  detection in artworks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monitoring the health of ancient artworks requires adequate prudence because
of the sensitive nature of these materials. Classical techniques for
identifying the development of faults rely on acoustic testing. These
techniques, being invasive, may result in causing permanent damage to the
material, especially if the material is inspected periodically. Non destructive
testing has been carried out for different materials since long. In this
regard, non-invasive systems were developed based on infrared thermometry
principle to identify the faults in artworks. The test artwork is heated and
the thermal response of the different layers is captured with the help of a
thermal infrared camera. However, prolonged heating risks overheating and thus
causing damage to artworks and an alternate approach is to use pseudo-random
binary sequence excitations. The faults in the artwork, though, cannot be
detected on the captured images, especially if their strength is weak. The
weaker faults are either masked by the stronger ones, by the pictorial layer of
the artwork or by the non-uniform heating. This work addresses the detection
and localization of the faults through a wavelet based subspace decomposition
scheme. The proposed scheme, on one hand, allows to remove the background
while, on the other hand, removes the undesired high frequency noise. It is
shown that the detection parameter is proportional to the diameter and the
depth of the fault. A criterion is proposed to select the optimal wavelet basis
along with suitable level selection for wavelet decomposition and
reconstruction. The proposed approach is tested on a laboratory developed test
sample with known fault locations and dimensions as well as real artworks. A
comparison with a previously reported method demonstrates the efficacy of the
proposed approach for fault detection in artworks.

star formation main sequence (MS) at the high mass end. To investigate the role
of bulges in shaping the MS, we compare the NUV$-r$ color between the central
($r<R_{50}$) and outer regions for a sample of 6401 local star-forming
galaxies. The NUV$-r$ color is a good specific star formation rate indicator.
We find that at $M_{\ast}<10^{10.2}M_{\sun}$, the central NUV$-r$ is on average
only $\sim$ 0.25 mag redder than the outer NUV$-r$. Above
$M_{\ast}=10^{10.2}M_{\sun}$, the central NUV$-r$ becomes systematically much
redder than the outer NUV$-r$ for more massive galaxies, indicating that the
central bulge is more evolved at the massive end. When dividing the galaxies
according to their S\'ersic index $n$, we find that galaxies with $n$>2.0 tend
to be redder in the central NUV$-r$ color than those with $n$<2.0, even at
fixed B/T and $M_{\ast}$. This suggests that star formation in bulges is more
strongly dependent on $n$ (or central mass density) than on B/T. Finally, we
find that the fraction of galaxies with $n$>2.0 rapidly increases with
$M_{\ast}$ at $M_{\ast}>10^{10.2}M_{\sun}$, which is consistent with the
turning over of the MS at the same transition mass. We conclude that the
increasing fraction of low-sSFR dense bulges in $M_{\ast}>10^{10.2}M_{\sun}$
galaxies, rather than increasing B/T, is responsible for the flattened slope of
the $M_{\ast}$$-$SFR relation at high masses.

outstanding open question whether the $O^*(2^{n/2})$-time algorithm for Subset
Sum by Horowitz and Sahni [J. ACM 1974] can be beaten in the worst-case setting
by a ""truly faster"", $O^*(2^{(0.5-\delta)n})$-time algorithm, with some
constant $\delta > 0$. Continuing an earlier work [STACS 2015], we study Subset
Sum parameterized by the maximum bin size $\beta$, defined as the largest

Consequently, we also obtain a characterization in terms of the popular density
parameter $n/\log_2 t$: if all instances of density at least $1.003$ admit a
truly faster algorithm, then so does every instance. This goes against the
current intuition that instances of density 1 are the hardest, and therefore is
a step toward answering the open question in the affirmative. Our results stem
from novel combinations of earlier algorithms for Subset Sum and a study of an

  information",,,,,"q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We generalise the description of the dynamics of the order book of financial
markets in terms of a Brownian particle embedded in a fluid of incoming,
exiting and annihilating particles by presenting a model of the velocity on
each side (buy and sell) independently. The improved model builds on the
time-averaged number of particles in the inner layer and its change per unit
time, where the inner layer is revealed by the correlations between price
velocity and change in the number of particles (limit orders). This allows us
to introduce the Knudsen number of the financial Brownian particle motion and
its asymmetric version (on the buy and sell sides). Not being considered
previously, the asymmetric Knudsen numbers are crucial in finance in order to
detect asymmetric price changes. The Knudsen numbers allows us to characterise
the conditions for the market dynamics to be correctly described by a
continuous stochastic process. Not questioned until now for large liquid
markets such as the USD/JPY and EUR/USD exchange rates, we show that there are
regimes when the Knudsen numbers are so high that discrete particle effects
dominate, such as during market stresses and crashes. We document the presence
of imbalances of particles depletion rates on the buy and sell sides that are
associated with high Knudsen numbers and violent directional price changes.
This indicator can detect the direction of the price motion at the early stage
while the usual volatility risk measure is blind to the price direction.

chain $U \to X \to Y$, has been the method of choice for proving impossibility
(converse) results in information theory and many other disciplines. Various
channel-dependent improvements (called strong data-processing inequalities, or
SDPIs) of this inequality have been proposed both classically and more
recently. In this note we first survey known results relating various notions
of contraction for a single channel. Then we consider the basic extension:
given SDPI for each constituent channel in a Bayesian network, how to produce
an end-to-end SDPI?
  Our approach is based on the (extract of the) Evans-Schulman method, which is
demonstrated for three different kinds of SDPIs, namely, the usual
Ahslwede-G\'acs type contraction coefficients (mutual information), Dobrushin's
contraction coefficients (total variation), and finally the $F_I$-curve (the
best possible non-linear SDPI for a given channel). Resulting bounds on the
contraction coefficients are interpreted as probability of site percolation. As
an example, we demonstrate how to obtain SDPI for an $n$-letter memoryless
channel with feedback given an SDPI for $n=1$.
  Finally, we discuss a simple observation on the equivalence of a linear SDPI
and comparison to an erasure channel (in the sense of ""less noisy"" order). This
leads to a simple proof of a curious inequality of Samorodnitsky (2015), and
sheds light on how information spreads in the subsets of inputs of a memoryless
channel.

distributions of halo spin in N-body simulations. After analyzing spin
evolution in halo merging trees, it was found that a spin change can be
characterized by a stochastic random walk of angular momentum. Also, spin
distributions generated by random walks are fairly consistent with those
directly obtained from N-body simulations. We derived a stochastic differential
equation from a widely used spin definition and measured the probability
distributions of the derived angular momentum change from a massive set of halo
merging trees. The roles of major merging and accretion are also statistically
analyzed in evolving spin distributions. Several factors (local environment,
halo mass, merging mass ratio, and redshift) are found to influence the angular
momentum change. The spin distributions generated in the mean-field or void
regions tend to shift slightly to a higher spin value compared with simulated
spin distributions, which seems to be caused by the correlated random walks. We
verified the assumption of randomness in the angular momentum change observed
in the N-body simulation and detected several degrees of correlation between
walks, which may provide a clue for the discrepancies between the simulated and
generated spin distributions in the voids. However, the generated spin
distributions in the group and cluster regions successfully match the simulated
spin distribution. We also demonstrated that the log-normality of the spin
distribution is a natural consequence of the stochastic differential equation
of the halo spin, which is well described by the Geometric Brownian Motion
model.

brightest sources ever discovered in very high-energy gamma rays but also well
observed in other wavebands. In X-rays, the emission is dominated by
synchrotron radiation, which links directly to the existence of high-energy
electrons. Radio observations of CO and HI gas have revealed a highly
inhomogeneous medium surrounding the SNR, such as clumpy molecular clouds.
Therefore gamma rays from hadronic interactions are naturally expected.

typical of leptonic emission from accelerated electrons. Despite lots of

uncertainty in the quest of unraveling the true origin of the gamma-ray

estimates environmental noise from speech adaptively utilizing both magnitude
and phase components of the speech spectrum. We performed multi-band spectrum
subtraction by dividing the noisy speech spectrum into different non-uniform
frequency bands having varying signal to noise ratio (SNR) and subtracting the
estimated noise from each of these frequency bands. This results to the
elimination of noise from both high SNR and low SNR signal components for all
the frequency bands. We have coined our proposed speech enhancement technique
as Multi Band Magnitude Phase Spectral Subtraction (MBMPSS). The magnitude and
phase operations are executed concurrently exploiting the parallel logic blocks
of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), thus increasing the throughput of the
system to a great extent. We have implemented our design on Spartan6 Lx45 FPGA
and presented the implementation result in terms of resource utilization and
delay information for the different blocks of our design. To the best of our
best knowledge, this is a new type of hardware design for speech enhancement
application and also a first of its kind implementation on reconfigurable
hardware. We have used benchmark audio data for the evaluation of the proposed
hardware and the experimental results show that our hardware shows a better SNR
value compared to the existing state of the art research works.

and Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitters. Their optical emission is often
dominated by non-thermal, and, in the case of BL Lacs, featureless continuum
radiation. This renders the determination of their redshift extremely
difficult. Indeed, as of today only about 50 % of gamma-ray blazars have a
measured spectroscopic redshift. The knowledge of redshift is fundamental
because it allows the precise modeling of the VHE emission and also of its
interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). The beginning of the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) operations in the near future will allow the
detection of several hundreds of new BL Lacs. Using the first Fermi catalogue
of sources above 10 GeV (1FHL), we performed simulations which demonstrate that
at least half of the 1FHL BL Lacs detectable by CTA will not have a measured
redshift. Indeed the organization of observing campaigns to measure the
redshift of these blazars has been recognized as a necessary support for the
AGN Key Science Project of CTA. Taking advantage of the recent success of an
X-shooter GTO observing campaign, we thus devised an observing campaign to
measure the redshifts of as many as possible of these candidates. The main
characteristic of this campaign with respect to previous ones will be the use
of higher resolution spectrographs and of 8 meter class telescopes. We are

Heinonen and Semmes.
  The non-minimality of the Heisenberg group is shown by giving an example of
an Ahlfors $4$-regular metric space $X$ having big pieces of itself such that
no Lipschitz map from a subset of $X$ to the Heisenberg group has image with
positive measure, and by providing a Lipschitz map from the Heisenberg group to
the space $X$ having as image the whole $X$.
  As part of proving the above result we define a new distance on the
Heisenberg group that is bounded by the Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance, that
preserves the Ahlfors-regularity, and such that the Carnot-Carath\'eodory
distance and the new distance are biLipschitz equivalent on no set of positive
measure. This construction works more generally in any Ahlfors-regular metric
space where one can make suitable shortcuts. Such spaces include for example
all snowflaked Ahlfors-regular metric spaces. With the same techniques we also
provide an example of a left-invariant distance on the Heisenberg group
biLipschitz to the Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance for which no blow-up admits

Therefore it may be interesting to know how robust the predictions of a mass

applying general multiplicative perturbations we explicitly quantify how

different from the original mass matrix, or even a neutrino mass ordering
different from the original one. Both the general case and an explicit flavor
symmetry model are studied. We give the probabilities as a function of the

molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions. By systematically varying the
damping magnitude $\zeta$ in the low-temperature limit, we identify two well
defined flow regimes, separated by a thin (temperature-dependent) crossover
region. In the overdamped regime, the athermal rheology is governed by the
competition between elastic forces and viscous forces, whose ratio gives the
Weissenberg number $Wi= \zeta \dot\gamma$ (up to elastic parameters); the
macroscopic stress $\Sigma$ follows the frequently encountered Herschel-Bulkley
law $\Sigma= \Sigma\_0 + k \sqrt{Wi}$, with yield stress
$\Sigma\_0\textgreater{}0$. In the underdamped (inertial) regime, dramatic
changes in the rheology are observed for low damping: the flow curve becomes
non-monotonic. This change is not caused by longer-lived correlations in the
particle dynamics at lower damping; instead, for weak dissipation, the sample
heats up considerably due to, and in proportion to, the driving. By suitably
thermostatting more or less underdamped systems, we show that their rheology
only depends on their kinetic temperature and the shear rate, rescaled with
Einstein's vibration frequency.

by the metallicity range of the current sample, the calibrations are mainly
applicable for disk stars ([Fe/H]$\,\gtrsim\,-1.0$). The normalized percentage
residuals of the calibrations are typically 2.0 and 1.5 per cent for dwarfs and

diverge. I explore the consequences of chiral symmetry for the values of
$m_\pi$ close to $m_\pi^\star$. It turns out that chiral symmetry is crucial
for an $S$-wave resonance to be able to stand very near threshold and in the
meantime to remain narrow, provided that the mass splitting is reasonably
small. The effective range of pion-baryon scattering is unexpectedly large,
proportional to $ 4\pi f_\pi^2/m_\pi^3$ when $m_\pi$ is around $m_\pi^\star$.
As a result, this unexpected large length scale causes universality relations
to break down much sooner than naively expected.

the limit of the difference quotient of the increment of a function and the

define regularized Taylor series and compound differential rules. In particular
a compound differential rule for Holder 1/2 functions is demonstrated. The

measured using $3 fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected by the

We combined optical measurements (both infrared and Raman spectroscopy) with ab

previously computed measures. To understand theoretically the underlying matrix

paper, we consider two different MNOs coexisting in the same area, and exploit
their collaboration in both energy purchase and wireless load sharing for
energy cost saving. Specifically, we propose a new approach named energy group
buying with load sharing, in which the two MNOs are aggregated as a single
group to make the day-ahead and real-time energy purchase, and their base
stations (BSs) share the wireless traffic to maximally turn lightly-loaded BSs
into sleep mode. When the two MNOs belong to the same entity and aim to
minimize their total energy cost, we use the two-stage stochastic programming
to obtain the optimal day-ahead and real-time energy group buying jointly with
wireless load sharing. When the two MNOs belong to different entities and are
self-interested in minimizing their individual energy costs, we propose a novel
repeated Nash bargaining scheme for them to negotiate and share their energy
costs under energy group buying and load sharing. Our proposed repeated Nash
bargaining scheme is shown to achieve Pareto-optimal and fair energy cost
reductions for both MNOs.

various properties of the stellar models. We study the conditions for obtaining
homogeneous evolution triggered by tidal interactions, and for avoiding any
Roche lobe overflow during the Main-Sequence phase. We consider the case of
rotating stars computed with a strong coupling mediated by an interior magnetic
field. In models without any tidal interaction (single stars and wide
binaries), homogeneous evolution in solid body rotating models is obtained when
two conditions are realized: the initial rotation must be high enough, the loss
of angular momentum by stellar winds should be modest. This last point favors
metal-poor fast rotating stars. In models with tidal interactions, homogeneous
evolution is obtained when rotation imposed by synchronization is high enough
(typically a time-averaged surface velocities during the Main-Sequence phase
above 250 km s$^{-1}$), whatever the mass losses. In close binaries, mixing is
stronger at higher than at lower metallicities. Homogeneous evolution is thus
favored at higher metallicities. Roche lobe overflow avoidance is favored at
lower metallicities due to the fact that stars with less metals remain more
compact. We study also the impact of different processes for the angular
momentum transport on the surface abundances and velocities in single and close
binaries. In models where strong internal coupling is assumed, strong surface
enrichments are always associated to high surface velocities in binary or
single star models. In contrast, models computed with mild coupling may produce
strong surface enrichments associated to low surface velocities. Close binary
models may be of interest for explaining homogeneous massive stars, fast
rotating Wolf-Rayet stars, and progenitors of long soft gamma ray bursts, even
at high metallicities.

by pseudoinversion, which, in spite of its popularity, is sometimes affected by
numerical instability issues. Regularization is known to be effective in such
cases, so that we introduce, in the framework of Tikhonov regularization, a
matricial reformulation of the problem which allows us to use the condition
number as a diagnostic tool for identification of instability. By imposing
well-conditioning requirements on the relevant matrices, our theoretical
analysis allows the identification of an optimal value for the regularization
parameter from the standpoint of stability. We compare with the value derived
by cross-validation for overfitting control and optimisation of the

Stuckey","Unsatisfiable Cores and Lower Bounding for Constraint Programming",,,,,"cs.LO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Constraint Programming (CP) solvers typically tackle optimization problems by
repeatedly finding solutions to a problem while placing tighter and tighter
bounds on the solution cost. This approach is somewhat naive, especially for
soft-constraint optimization problems in which the soft constraints are mostly
satisfied. Unsatisfiable-core approaches to solving soft constraint problems in
SAT (e.g. MAXSAT) force all soft constraints to be hard initially. When solving
fails they return an unsatisfiable core, as a set of soft constraints that
cannot hold simultaneously. These are reverted to soft and solving continues.
Since lazy clause generation solvers can also return unsatisfiable cores we can
adapt this approach to constraint programming. We adapt the original MAXSAT
unsatisfiable core solving approach to be usable for constraint programming and
define a number of extensions. Experimental results show that our methods are
beneficial on a broad class of CP-optimization benchmarks involving soft
constraints, cardinality or preferences.

higher critical current, triplet superconductivity etc. However, very little

triggering phase slip processes in the composite films (CFs). We demonstrate
that less than 1 at. % of magnetic contribution in the CFs can initiate phase

superconducting nanostructures. Here, we employ wide mesoscopic NbGd based CFs
to study the phase slip processes. Low temperature current-voltage

slip events and are absent in pure SC films. Depending on the bias current and
temperature, distinct regions, dominated by Abrikosov type vortex-antivortex
(v-av) pairs and phase slip events, are observed. The results presented here
open a new way to study the phase slip mechanism, its interaction with v-av

into potentially thousands of subqueries distributed among SPARQL endpoints,
data providers do not know federated queries, they only know subqueries they

finite temperature systems are resolved. A general formula for the conductivity
of a Lorentzian two-component plasma in thermal equilibrium is derived from the
Lenard-Balescu collision integral in which both energy and momentum exchange
between ions and electrons are accounted for. This formula is used as a basis
for some generalizations of the Ziman formula, which apply to plasmas of
arbitrary degeneracy over a much wider range of conditions. These formulae
implicitly include the collective motions of the ions, but neglect the
collective motions of the electrons. Detailed consideration of the latter shows
that they generally have a small effect on the conductivity. Conditions for the
validity of the Ziman formula are derived. The extension of the general theory
to arbitrarily low temperatures, where the ion dynamics become dominated by
collective effects, in which dynamical ion correlations need to be taken into
account, is shown to lead to the well-known Bloch formula. Consideration is
given to non-Lorentzian plasmas by explicitly accounting for electron-electron
collisions. Corrections to the Lorentzian model in the form of a power series
in 1/Z are derived.

class of randomized iterative algorithms based on similar principles to address
a variety of common tasks in numerical linear algebra. From the point of view
of numerical linear algebra, the main novelty of the Fast Randomized Iteration
schemes described in this article is that they work in either linear or
constant cost per iteration (and in total, under appropriate conditions) and
are rather versatile: we will show how they apply to solution of linear
systems, eigenvalue problems, and matrix exponentiation, in dimensions far
beyond the present limits of numerical linear algebra. While traditional
iterative methods in numerical linear algebra were created in part to deal with
instances where a matrix (of size $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$) is too big to store, the
algorithms that we propose are effective even in instances where the solution
vector itself (of size $\mathcal{O}(n)$) may be too big to store or manipulate.
In fact, our work is motivated by recent DMC based quantum Monte Carlo schemes
that have been applied to matrices as large as $10^{108} \times 10^{108}$. We
provide basic convergence results, discuss the dependence of these results on
the dimension of the system, and demonstrate dramatic cost savings on a range
of test problems.

consists of lifting steps (LSs), is that while removing correlation it
contaminates transformed components with noise from other components. Noise
affects particularly adversely the compression ratios of lossless compression
algorithms. To remove correlation without increasing noise, a reversible
denoising and lifting step (RDLS) was proposed that integrates denoising
filters into LS. Applying RDLS to color space transformation results in a new
image component transformation that is perfectly reversible despite involving
the inherently irreversible denoising; the first application of such a
transformation is presented in this paper. For the JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000, and JPEG
XR standard algorithms in lossless mode, the application of RDLS to the RDgDb
color space transformation with simple denoising filters is especially
effective for images in the native optical resolution of acquisition devices.
It results in improving compression ratios of all those images in cases when
unmodified color space transformation either improves or worsens ratios
compared with the untransformed image. The average improvement is 5.0-6.0\% for
two out of the three sets of such images, whereas average ratios of images from
standard test-sets are improved by up to 2.2\%. For the efficient
image-adaptive determination of filters for RDLS, a couple of fast
entropy-based estimators of compression effects that may be used independently
of the actual compression algorithm are investigated and an immediate filter
selection method based on the detector precision characteristic model driven by
image acquisition parameters is introduced.

  Distributions","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In several application areas, such as human computer interaction,
surveillance and defence, determining the intent of a tracked object enables
systems to aid the user/operator and facilitate effective, possibly automated,
decision making. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic inference approach
that permits the prediction, well in advance, of the intended destination of a
tracked object and its future trajectory. Within the framework introduced here,
the observed partial track of the object is modeled as being part of a Markov
bridge terminating at its destination, since the target path, albeit random,
must end at the intended endpoint. This captures the underlying long term
dependencies in the trajectory, as dictated by the object intent. By
determining the likelihood of the partial track being drawn from a particular
constructed bridge, the probability of each of a number of possible
destinations is evaluated. These bridges can also be employed to produce
refined estimates of the latent system state (e.g. object position, velocity,
etc.), predict its future values (up until reaching the designated endpoint)

within a few degrees of the Galactic Centre, with the Galactic Centre itself
and the most intense diffuse emission regions removed from the analysis.
Assuming a cuspy dark matter density profile for the Milky Way, 500 hours of
observations in this region provide sensitivities to and below the thermal
cross-section of dark matter annihilations, for masses between a few hundred
GeV and a few tens of TeV; therefore CTA will have a significant chance of
discovery in some models. Since the dark matter density in the Milky Way is far
from certain in the inner kpc region, other targets are also proposed for
observation, like ultra-faint dwarf galaxies such as Segue 1 with 100 hours per
year proposed. Beyond these two observational targets, further alternatives,
such as Galactic dark clumps, will be considered closer to the actual date of
CTA operations. Sensitivity predictions for dark matter searches are given on
the various targets taking into account the latest instrument response

neutron) diffraction measurements, new experimental results keep appearing,
virtually every year. The reason for this is that neither X-ray, nor neutron
diffraction data are trivial to correct and interpret for this essential
substance. Since X-rays are somewhat insensitive to hydrogen, neutron
diffraction with (most frequently, H/D) isotopic substitution is vital for
investigating the most important feature in water: hydrogen bonding. Here, the
two very recent sets of neutron diffraction data are considered, both
exploiting the contrast between light and heavy hydrogen, $^1$H and $^2$H, in
different ways. Reverse Monte Carlo structural modeling is applied for
constructing large structural models that are as consistent as possible with
all experimental information, both in real and reciprocal space. The method has
also proven to be useful for revealing where possible small inconsistencies
appear during primary data processing: for one neutron data set, it is the
molecular geometry that may not be maintained within reasonable limits, whereas
for the other set, it is one of the (composite) radial distribution functions
that cannot be modeled at the same (high) level as the other three functions.
Nevertheless, details of the local structure around the hydrogen bonds appear
very much the same for both data sets: the most probable hydrogen bond angle is
straight, and the nearest oxygen neighbours of a central oxygen atom occupy

Population III (Pop III) supernovae with nucleosynthetic yields featuring high

how well these chemical abundance signatures are preserved in the gas prior to
forming the first long-lived low-mass stars (or second-generation stars). Our
results show that second-generation stars can retain the nucleosynthetic
signature of their Pop III progenitors, even in the presence of
nucleosynthetically normal Pop III core-collapse supernovae. We find that
carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars are likely second-generation stars that form
in minihaloes. Furthermore, it is likely that the majority of Pop III
supernovae produce high [C/Fe] yields. In contrast, metals ejected by a PISN
are not concentrated in the first star forming haloes, which may explain the
absence of observed PISN signatures in metal-poor stars. We also find that
unique Pop III abundance signatures in the gas are quickly wiped out by the
emergence of Pop II supernovae. We caution that the observed fractions of stars
with Pop III signatures cannot be directly interpreted as the fraction of Pop
III stars producing that signature. Such interpretations require modelling the
metal enrichment process prior to the second-generation stars' formation,
including results from simulations of metal mixing. The full potential of
stellar archaeology can likely be reached in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where
the simple formation history may allow for straightforward identification of
second-generation stars.

which an excited quantum system returns to equilibrium. For spins, however,
spontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative
relaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole
and the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous
emission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a
resonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the
lifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or
optical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first
application of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in
silicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small
mode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission
constitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is
increased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity
resonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled
on-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin
systems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and
quantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular
belief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the
electromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum
fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work
represents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of
individual spins to microwave photons.

with a model that includes a self-consistent calculation of the gas
temperature. This way we can discard the assumption of equality between the
dust and gas temperatures, and study the stability as the gas temperature
changes with chemical evolution of the gas.
  Methods. We use a gas-grain chemical model including a time-dependent
treatment of depletion onto grain surfaces, which strongly influences the gas
temperature as the main coolant, CO, depletes from the gas. Dust and gas
temperatures are solved with radiative transfer. For comparison with previous
work, we assume that the cores are deeply embedded in a larger external
structure, corresponding to visual extinction $A_{\rm V}^{\rm ext}=10$ mag.
  Results. We find that the critical non-dimensional radius $\xi_1$ derived
here is similar to our previous work where we assumed $T_{\rm dust}=T_{\rm
gas}$; the $\xi_1$ values lie below the isothermal critical value
$\xi_0\sim6.45$, but the difference is less than 10%. Chemical evolution does
not affect notably the stability condition of low-mass cores (<0.75 $M_\odot$).
For higher masses the decrease of cooling owing to CO depletion causes
substantial temporal changes in the temperature and density profiles of the
cores. In the mass range 1-2 $M_\odot$ , $\xi_1$ decreases with chemical
evolution, whereas above 3 $M_\odot$ , $\xi_1$ instead increases. We also find
that decreasing $A_{\rm V}^{\rm ext}$ increases the gas temperature especially
when the gas is chemically old, causing $\xi_1$ to increase with respect to
models with higher $A_{\rm V}^{\rm ext}$. The derived $\xi_1$ values are close
to $\xi_0$. The density contrast between the core center and edge varies
between 8 to 16 depending on core mass and the chemical age of the gas,
compared to the constant value $\sim$ 14.1 for the isothermal BES.

neutrino beam is produced at J-PARC and detected 295 km away at the

lepton sector by comparing electron-neutrino appearance and
electron-antineutrino appearance. Indeed, the number of observed electron
neutrino events up to 2012 is, though within statistical fluctuation, larger
than the expectation, which suggests maximal CP violation. Since 2013, T2K has
been accumulating data with a muon antineutrino beam. If the suggested maximal
CP violation is true, electron-antineutrino appearance would be suppressed. The
signal is further suppressed by the smaller cross section for antineutrinos
compared to neutrinos. Hence the observation of electron-antineutrino
appearance is an important next step. Furthermore, the CPT theorem imposes that
the muon disappearance rate must be the same for muon neutrinos and muon
antineutrinos; therefore the comparison between neutrinos and antineutrinos is
a good test of the CPT theorem, or else a probe for new non-standard
interactions of neutrinos with matter. We will report the result of the first

coupling, $\zeta$, to the electromagnetic sector) the $\alpha$ variation.
Specifically, current data tightly constrains a combination of $\zeta$ and the
present dark energy equation of state $w_0$. Moreover, in these models the new
degree of freedom inevitably couples to nucleons (through the $\alpha$
dependence of their masses) and leads to violations of the Weak Equivalence
Principle. We obtain indirect bounds on the E\""otv\""os parameter $\eta$ that
are typically stronger than the current direct ones. We discuss the
model-dependence of our results and briefly comment on how the forthcoming
generation of high-resolution ultra-stable spectrographs will enable
significantly tighter constraints.

centerlines from very-high-resolution (VHR) re- mote sensing imagery for

three shortcomings of current methods: (a) Due to the noise and occlusions
(owing to vehicles and trees), most road extraction methods bring in
heterogeneous classification results; (b) Morphological thinning algorithm is
widely used to extract road centerlines, while it pro- duces small spurs around
the centerlines; (c) Many methods are ineffective to extract centerlines around
the road intersections. To address the above three issues, we propose a novel
method to ex- tract smooth and complete road centerlines via three techniques:
the multiscale joint collaborative representation (MJCR) & graph cuts (GC),
tensor voting (TV) & non-maximum suppression (NMS) and fitting based connection
algorithm. Specifically, a MJCR-GC based road area segmentation method is
proposed by incorporating mutiscale features and spatial information. In this
way, a homogenous road segmentation result is achieved. Then, to obtain a
smooth and correct road centerline network, a TV-NMS based centerline
extraction method is introduced. This method not only extracts smooth road
centerlines, but also connects the discontinuous road centerlines. Finally, to
overcome the ineffectiveness of current methods in the road intersection, a
fitting based road centerline connection algorithm is proposed. As a result, we
can get a complete road centerline network. Extensive experiments on two

well as more satisfactory visual performances by comparing with state-of-the-

An increase in the coagulation rate comes about not only due to the lowering of

intersections (specifically to devices attached to traffic lights). We consider
that information collected by these devices are transmitted to and processed in

intention information, can calculate average waiting times at intersections. We
consider this problem as a queuing model, and we characterize average waiting
times by taking into account (i) blocking probability, and (ii) vehicles'
ability to communicate their intentions. Then, by using average waiting times

phenomenologically appealing concept. The dark matter particle can be
stabilised with the help of flavour symmetries, without the need to introduce
an additional discrete symmetry by hand. Apart from the usual searches in
direct and indirect detection experiments and high energy colliders, flavoured
dark matter generally also gives rise to new flavour violating interactions
leading to interesting signatures in rare meson decays. This proceedings
article reviews a simplified model of flavoured dark matter in which the dark
matter coupling to quarks constitutes a new source of flavour violation, so
that the model goes beyond Minimal Flavour Violation. Particular emphasis is
put on the discussion of its phenomenological implications in flavour, collider
and direct detection experiments.

dual-hop hybrid relaying system relying on both radio frequency (RF) and free
space optical (FSO) links. Specifically, the RF link is used for supporting
mobile communication, while the FSO link is adopted as the backhaul of the
cellular infrastructure. Considering non-line-of-sight (NLoS) RF transmissions
and a generalized atmospheric turbulence (AT) channel, the associated
statistical features constituted of both the exact and the asymptotic moment
generating functions (MGF) are derived in closed form. They are then used for
calculating the ASER of M-ary phase shift keying (PSK), differentially encoded
non-coherent PSK (DPSK) and non-coherent frequency-shift keying (FSK). A range
of additional asymptotic expressions are also derived for all the modulation
schemes under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). It is observed from the
asymptotic analysis that the ASERs of all the modulation schemes are dominated
by the average SNR of the RF link in the hybrid relaying system using a fixed
relay gain, while in the relaying system using a dynamic channel dependent
relay gain, the ASERs of all the modulation schemes depend both on the average
SNR and on the AT condition of the FSO path. We also find that the fixed-gain
relaying strategy achieves twice the diversity order of the channel-dependent
relaying strategy albeit at the cost of requiring a high power amplifier (PA)
dynamic range at the relay node. Furthermore, by comparing the asymptotic
ASERs, we calculate the SNR differences between the different modulation
schemes in both the fixed-gain and the channel-dependent relaying system.
Finally, simulation results are presented for confirming the accuracy of our
expressions and observations.

order of 0.1$^\circ$ which is rather large for the study of morphological
structures and for comparing the morphology in $\gamma$-rays to measurements in
other wavelengths where the instruments have better angular resolutions.
  Serendipitously it is possible to approximate the underlying true source
distribution by applying a deconvolution algorithm to the observed skymap, thus
effectively improving the instruments angular resolution. From the multitude of
existing deconvolution algorithms several are already used in astronomy, but in
the special case of $\gamma$-ray astronomy most of these algorithms are
challenged due to the high noise level within the measured data.
  One promising algorithm for the application to $\gamma$-ray data is the
Maximum Entropy Algorithm. The advantages of this algorithm are the possibility
to take a priori knowledge into account and that it is an independent approach
to previous work, e.g., Heinz et al. (2012) who applied the Richardson Lucy
Algorithm to $\gamma$-ray skymaps.
  An implementation of the Maximum Entropy Algorithm is provided in the MemSys5
software package by Gull and Skilling (1999). As this algorithm is very
sensitive to various input parameters it is essential to understand their
influences. We present a study of the influences of these parameters in order
to investigate the applicability of the Maximum Entropy Algorithm for the

amplitude variation in a sample of main--sequence stars with light curves
collected using CoRoT exo--field CCDs. We analyze potential stellar activity
cycles by studying the variability amplitude over small boxes. The cycle
periods and amplitudes were computed based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram,
harmonic fits, and visual inspection. As a first application of our approach we
have considered the photometric data for 16 CoRoT FGK main sequence stars,

appear to follow the empirical relations between activity cycle periods

addition to the so-called A (active) and I (inactive) sequences previously
identified, there is a possible third sequence, here named S (short-cycles)
sequence. However, recovery fractions estimated from simulations suggest that
only a half of our sample has confident cycle measurements. Therefore, more

proceed from the strong coupling to the bath. Here, it is shown that these
deviations are related to the power spectrum of the bath. Specifically, it is
shown that the system thermal-equilibrium-state cannot be characterized by the
canonical Boltzmann's distribution in quantum mechanics. This is because the
uncertainty principle imposed a lower bound of the dispersion of the total
energy of the system that is dominated by the spectral density of the bath.
However, in the classical case, for a wide class of systems that interact via
central forces with pairwise-self-interacting environment, the system thermal
equilibrium state is exactly characterized by the canonical Boltzmann
distribution. As a consequence of this analysis and taking into account all
energy scales in the system and reservoir interaction, an effective coupling to
the environment is introduced. Sample computations in different regimes
predicted by this effective coupling are shown. Specifically, in the strong
coupling effective regime, the system exhibits deviations from standard
thermodynamics and in the weak coupling effective regime, quantum features such
as stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures. Moreover, it is
known that the spectrum of thermal baths depends on the non-Markovian
character. Hence, non-Markovian interactions have a important role in the
thermal equilibrium state of physical systems. For example, in quantum
optomechanics is looked up to cool the mechanical system through an auxiliary
system which generally is a cavity. This cooling process takes into account the
non-Markovian interaction and as it is shown here, it is more effective than if
we use only the Markovian approximation in the equation of motion for the
different modes.

a star part of a binary system where the orbital plane of the binary is
significantly tilted respect to the initial disk plane. Our aim is to test
whether the planet remains within the disk and continues to migrate towards the
star in a Type I/II mode in spite of the secular perturbations of the companion
star. This would explain observed exoplanets with significant inclination
respect to the equatorial plane of their host star. We have used two different
SPH codes, vine and phantom, to model the evolution of a system
star+disk+planet and companion star with time. After an initial coupled
evolution, the inclination of the disk and that of the planet begin to differ
significantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, respect to
the initial plane, is shorter than that of the planet which evolves
independently after about 10^4 yr following a perturbed N-body behavior.
However, the planet keeps migrating towards the star because during its orbital
motion it crosses the disk plane and the friction with the gas causes angular
momentum loss. Disk and planet in a significantly inclined binary system are
not dynamically coupled for small binary separations but evolve almost
independently. The planet abandons the disk and, due to the onset of a
significant mutual inclination, it interacts with the gas only when its orbit
intersects the disk plane. The drift of the planet towards the star is not due
to type I/II with the planet embedded in the disk but to the friction with the
gas during the disk crossing.

interest. For example, relevant quantities such as molecular alignment and
orientation, calculated numerically by using large basis sets, have lately
appeared in the literature. In this work, based on our recent exact solution to
an effective eight-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian for the molecular ground
state, we present analytic expressions for the stereochemical properties of OH.
Our results require the solution of algebraic equations only, agree well with
the aforementioned fully numerical calculations, provide compact expressions
for simple field geometries, allow ready access to relatively unexplored
parameter space, and yield straightforwardly higher moments of the molecular
axis distribution.

on k factors must be a multiple of a certain number, say L_t, that depends on
the orders of the factors. Thus L_t is a lower bound on the size of arrays of
strength t on those factors, and is no larger than L_k, the size of the
complete factorial design. We investigate the relationship between the numbers
L_t, and two questions in particular: For what t is L_t < L_k? And when L_t =
L_k, is the complete factorial design the only array of that size and strength
t? Arrays are assumed to be mixed-level.
  We refer to an array of size less than L_k as a proper fraction. Guided by
our main result, we construct a variety of mixed-level proper fractions of
strength k-1 that also satisfy a certain group-theoretic condition.

intricate microstructures, which often can be difficult to characterize in a
quantitative way. In recent years, a number of novel topological metrics for
microstructures have been proposed, which measure essential connectivity
information and are based on techniques from algebraic topology. Such metrics
are inherently computable using computational homology, provided the
microstructures are discretized using a thresholding process. However, while in
many cases the thresholding is straightforward, noise and measurement errors
can lead to misleading metric values. In such situations, persistence
landscapes have been proposed as a natural topology metric. Common to all of
these approaches is the enormous data reduction, which passes from complicated
patterns to discrete information. It is therefore natural to wonder what type
of information is actually retained by the topology. In the present paper, we
demonstrate that averaged persistence landscapes can be used to recover central
system information in the Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase separation. More
precisely, we show that topological information of evolving microstructures
alone suffices to accurately detect both concentration information and the
actual decomposition stage of a data snapshot. Considering that persistent
homology only measures discrete connectivity information, regardless of the
size of the topological features, these results indicate that the system
parameters in a phase separation process affect the topology considerably more
than anticipated. We believe that the methods discussed in this paper could
provide a valuable tool for relating experimental data to model simulations.

overview of the mechanisms implemented to represent competing hypotheses used

confronting different mechanisms with similar evaluation criteria. It enables
the identification of the best-performing models with respect to the chosen

urgent as OLT keeps increasing its provisioning data rate, and higher data rate
provisioning usually implies higher energy consumption. In this paper, we
propose a novel energy-efficient OLT structure which guarantees services of end

we adapt the number of power-on OLT line cards to the real-time incoming

techniques: averages on linearly interpolated subsets, correlation of linearly
interpolated data, compressed sensing spectral estimation, and maximum
likelihood data reconstruction. With five frequency decades, the spectra we
obtained have the largest frequency range ever computed at 5 astronomical units
from the Sun; spectral exponents have been determined for all the components of
the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Void analysis is also useful in
recovering other spectral properties such as integral scales (see for instance

ecosystems. The development of rules and regulations to protect these
ecosystems against human activities requires availability of environmental
assessment standard. This necessitates the identification of the key parameters
that reflect condition of the coastal water ecosystem. Macrobenthic assemblages
are recognized to rapidly respond to changes in the quality of water or
habitat. Therefore, it would be useful to study the population of macrobenthos
and assess the influential factors on the growth of this species. This study is
categorized as multidisciplinary approach which contains two perspectives,
ecological and mathematical. In the ecological section, the effect of the water
quality parameters (e.g. pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity) and
the sediment characteristics on the macrobenthic abundance is studied. A total
of 432 samples were collected and analyzed from four touristic costal locations
(at various distances form the coast) of Penang National Park to investigate
the spatial change of macrobenthic assemblage. In a mathematical perspective,
this paper pursues a new algorithm based on the performance evaluation methods.
For this purpose, first, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is employed to
evaluate a group of Decision Making Units (DMUs). Consequently, inputs of the
mentioned DMUs are considered as alternatives (or candidates), and using a
modified DEA model that is categorized as aggregating preference ranking
method, the influence of inputs in efficiency of DMUs is investigated.
