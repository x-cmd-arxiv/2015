WLAN. We consider the station (STA)-access point (AP) association and airtime
control for virtualized 802.11 networks to provide service customization and
fairness across multiple internet service providers (ISPs) sharing the common
physical infrastructure and network capacity. More specifically, an
optimization problem is formulated on the STAs transmission probabilities to
maximize the overall network throughput, while providing airtime usage
guarantees for the ISPs. Subsequently, an algorithm to reach the optimal
solution is developed by applying monomial approximation and geometric
programming iteratively. Based on the proposed three-dimensional Markov-chain
model of the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) protocol, the detailed
implementation of the optimal transmission probability is also discussed. The
accuracy of the proposed Markov-chain model and the performance of the
developed association and airtime control scheme are evaluated through
numerical results.

isolated neutron stars that were born during the preceding core-collapse
supernova explosion. Here we present evidence that at least in one case the CCO
could have been formed within a binary system. We show that the highly reddened
optical source IRAS~17287$-$3443, located $25^{\prime \prime}$ away from the
CCO candidate XMMUJ173203.3$-$344518 and classified previously as a post
asymptotic giant branch star, is indeed surrounded by a dust shell. This shell
is heated by the central star to temperatures of $\sim90$\,K and observed as
extended infrared emission in 8-160\,$\mu$m band. The dust temperature also
increases in the vicinity of the CCO which implies that it likely resides
within the shell. We estimate the total dust mass to be $\sim0.4-1.5\,M_\odot$
which significantly exceeds expected dust yields by normal stars and thus
likely condensed from supernova ejecta. Taking into account that both the age
of the supernova remnant and the duration of active mass loss phase by the
optical star are much shorter than the total lifetime of either object, the
supernova and the onset of the active mass loss phase of the companion have
likely occurred approximately simultaneously. This is most easily explained if
the evolution of both objects is interconnected. We conclude, therefore, that
both stars were likely members of the same binary system disrupted by a
supernova.

and controlling the dynamics of complex networked systems. It allows us to
infer properties of the interaction matrix, which characterizes how nodes in a

studies, network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. The
fundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix
(e.g., adjacency pattern, sign pattern and degree sequence) can be inferred
from given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. Here we rigorously
derive necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction
matrix. These conditions characterize how uncertain can we be about the
coupling functions that characterize the interactions between nodes, and how
informative does the measured temporal data need to be; rendering two classes
of fundamental limitations of network reconstruction. Counterintuitively, we
find that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically
as difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself, requiring equally
informative temporal data. Revealing these fundamental limitations shed light
on the design of better network reconstruction algorithms, which offer
practical improvements over existing methods.

V. Keldysh,
from whom we have learned so much. In this paper we study the potential and
electron density depth profiles in surface accumulation layers in crystals with
a large and nonlinear dielectric response such as SrTiO$_3$ (STO) in the cases
of planar, spherical and cylindrical geometries. The electron gas can be
created by applying an induction $D_0$ to the STO surface. We describe the
lattice dielectric response of STO using the Landau-Ginzburg free energy
expansion and employ the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation for the electron gas.
For the planar geometry we arrive at the electron density profile $n(x) \propto
(x+d)^{-12/7}$, where $d \propto D_0^{-7/5} $. We extend our results to
overlapping electron gases in GTO/STO/GTO multi-heterojunctions and electron
gases created by spill-out from NSTO (heavily $n$-type doped STO) layers into
STO. Generalization of our approach to a spherical donor cluster creating a big
TF atom with electrons in STO brings us to the problem of supercharged nuclei.
It is known that for an atom with nuclear charge $Ze$, where $Z > 170$,
electrons collapse onto the nucleus resulting in a net charge $Z_n < Z$. Here,
instead of relativistic physics, the collapse is caused by the nonlinear
dielectric response. Electrons collapse into the charged spherical donor
cluster with radius $R$ when its total charge number $Z$ exceeds the critical
value $Z_c \simeq R/a$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. The net charge
$eZ_n$ grows with $Z$ until $Z$ exceeds $Z^* \simeq (R/a)^{9/7}$. After this
point, the charge number of the compact core $Z_n$ remains $\simeq Z^*$, with
the rest $Z^*$ electrons forming a sparse Thomas-Fermi electron atmosphere
around it. We extend our results to the case of long cylindrical clusters as
well.

conflict control mechanism, allowing several processes to access the shared
data object at the same time. They guarantee that at least one concurrent
operation finishes in a finite number of its own steps regardless of the state
of the operations. Our analysis considers such lock-free data structures that
can be represented as linear combinations of fixed size retry loops. Our main
contribution is a new way of modeling and analyzing a general class of
lock-free algorithms, achieving predictions of throughput that are close to
what we observe in practice. We emphasize two kinds of conflicts that shape the
performance: (i) hardware conflicts, due to concurrent calls to atomic
primitives; (ii) logical conflicts, caused by simultaneous operations on the
shared data structure. We show how to deal with these hardware and logical
conflicts separately, and how to combine them, so as to calculate the
throughput of lock-free algorithms. We propose also a common framework that
enables a fair comparison between lock-free implementations by covering the
whole contention domain, together with a better understanding of the
performance impacting factors. This part of our analysis comes with a method
for calculating a good back-off strategy to finely tune the performance of a
lock-free algorithm. Our experimental results, based on a set of widely used
concurrent data structures and on abstract lock-free designs, show that our
analysis follows closely the actual code behavior.

work is to find the optimal number of activated RF chains that maximizes the
sum-rate. Computing the optimal number of activated RF chains must be
accompanied by an adequate antenna selection strategy. First, we derive
analytically the optimal number of RF chains to be activated so that the
average sum-rate is maximized under received equal power. Then, we propose an
efficient greedy algorithm to select the sub-optimal set of RF chains to be
activated with regards to the system sum-rate. It allows finding the balance
between the power consumed at the RF chains and the transmitted power. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the optimal performance
given by brute force search (BFS) antenna selection. Simulations allow to
compare the performance given by greedy, optimal and random antenna selection

of guards. The proposed algorithms are optimized to the bounded setting and
thus are more efficient and can handle a larger class of timed automata than
the general algorithms. The approach is implemented in a prototype tool and
evaluated on several examples. To our best knowledge, this is the first
implementation of this type of procedure for timed automata.

dynamic graph smoothed analysis studies the impact of random perturbations of

application of smoothed analysis, our goal is to study whether known strong
lower bounds in dynamic network models are robust or fragile: do they withstand
small (random) perturbations, or do such deviations push the graphs far enough

lower bounds are likely not relevant for real-world deployment, while robust
lower bounds represent a true difficulty caused by dynamic behavior. We apply
this technique to three standard dynamic network problems with known strong
worst-case lower bounds: random walks, flooding, and aggregation. We prove that
these bounds provide a spectrum of robustness when subjected to

for the earliest copy to finish is an effective method to combat the
variability in response time of individual servers, and reduce latency. But
adding redundancy may result in higher cost of computing resources, as well as
an increase in queueing delay due to higher traffic load. This work helps
understand when and how redundancy gives a cost-efficient reduction in latency.
For a general task service time distribution, we compare different redundancy
strategies in terms of the number of redundant tasks, and time when they are
issued and canceled. We get the insight that the log-concavity of the task
service time creates a dichotomy of when adding redundancy helps. If the
service time distribution is log-convex (i.e. log of the tail probability is
convex) then adding maximum redundancy reduces both latency and cost. And if it
is log-concave (i.e. log of the tail probability is concave), then less
redundancy, and early cancellation of redundant tasks is more effective. Using
these insights, we design a general redundancy strategy that achieves a good
latency-cost trade-off for an arbitrary service time distribution. This work
also generalizes and extends some results in the analysis of fork-join queues.

metric space $(X,\rho)$ we wish to find a small set of outlier points $K
\subset X$ and either an isometric or a low-distortion embedding of
$(X\setminus K,\rho)$ into some target metric space. This is a natural problem
that captures scenarios where a small fraction of points in the input
corresponds to noise.
  For the case of isometric embeddings we derive polynomial-time approximation
algorithms for minimizing the number of outliers when the target space is an
ultrametric, a tree metric, or constant-dimensional Euclidean space. The
approximation factors are 3, 4 and 2, respectively. For the case of embedding
into an ultrametric or tree metric, we further improve the running time to
$O(n^2)$ for an $n$-point input metric space, which is optimal. We complement
these upper bounds by showing that outlier embedding into ultrametrics, trees,
and $d$-dimensional Euclidean space for any $d\geq 2$ are all NP-hard, as well
as NP-hard to approximate within a factor better than 2 assuming the Unique
Game Conjecture.
  For the case of non-isometries we consider embeddings with small
$\ell_{\infty}$ distortion. We present polynomial-time \emph{bi-criteria}
approximation algorithms. Specifically, given some $\epsilon > 0$, let
$k_\epsilon$ denote the minimum number of outliers required to obtain an
embedding with distortion $\epsilon$. For the case of embedding into
ultrametrics we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm which computes a set of at
most $3k_{\epsilon}$ outliers and an embedding of the remaining points into an
ultrametric with distortion $O(\epsilon \log n)$. For embedding a metric of
unit diameter into constant-dimensional Euclidean space we present a
polynomial-time algorithm which computes a set of at most $2k_{\epsilon}$

thoughts on those events and to decide whether the rest of the users might find
it interesting or not. We have used topic modeling, which reveals the hidden

detailed a strategy for utilizing telescopes with narrow fields of view, such
as the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT), to localize gravity wave (GW) triggers from
LIGO/Virgo. If one considers the brightest galaxies that produce ~50% of the
light, then the number of galaxies inside typical GW error boxes will be
several tens. We have found that this result applies both in the early years of
Advanced LIGO when the range is small and the error boxes large, and in the
later years when the error boxes will be small and the range large. This
strategy has the beneficial property of reducing the number of telescope
pointings by a factor 10 to 100 compared with tiling the entire error box.
Additional galaxy count reduction will come from a GW rapid distance estimate
which will restrict the radial slice in search volume. Combining the bright
galaxy strategy with a convolution based on anticipated GW localizations, we
find that the searches can be restricted to about 18+/-5 galaxies for 2015,
about 23+/-4 for 2017, and about 11+/-2 for 2020. This assumes a distance
localization at or near the putative NS-NS merger range for each target year,
and these totals are integrated out to the range. Integrating out to the
horizon would roughly double the totals. For nearer localizations the totals
would decrease. The galaxy strategy we present in this work will enable
numerous sensitive optical and X-ray telescopes with small fields of view to
participate meaningfully in searches wherein the prospects for rapidly fading
afterglow place a premium on a fast response time.

the second year of optical imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Six
of these candidates are detected at high confidence, while two lower-confidence
candidates are identified in regions of non-uniform survey coverage. The new
stellar systems are found by three independent automated search techniques and
are identified as overdensities of stars, consistent with the isochrone and
luminosity function of an old and metal-poor simple stellar population. The new
systems are faint (Mv > -4.7 mag) and span a range of physical sizes (17 pc <
$r_{1/2}$ < 181 pc) and heliocentric distances (25 kpc < D < 214 kpc). All of
the new systems have central surface brightnesses consistent with known
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (\mu < 27.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$). Roughly half of the
DES candidates are more distant, less luminous, and/or have lower surface
brightnesses than previously known Milky Way satellite galaxies. Most of the
candidates are found in the southern part of the DES footprint close to the
Magellanic Clouds. We find that the DES data alone exclude (p < 0.001) a
spatially isotropic distribution of Milky Way satellites and that the observed
distribution can be well, though not uniquely, described by an association
between several of the DES satellites and the Magellanic system. Our model
predicts that the full sky may hold ~100 ultra-faint galaxies with physical
properties comparable to the DES satellites and that 20-30% of these would be
spatially associated with the Magellanic Clouds.

two-dimensional initial-value problem for the nonlinear collisional MHD
equations including electric resistivity, thermal conduction, and, in some
cases, gas-dynamic viscosity. The processes in the contact zone between two
horizontal magnetic fields of opposite polarities are considered. The plasma is
assumed to be initially motionless and having a temperature of 50,000 K uniform
throughout the plasma volume; the characteristic magnetic field corresponds to
a plasma $\beta\gtrsim 1$. In a physical-time interval of 17~seconds typically
covered by a computational run, the plasma temperature gradually increases by a
factor of two to three. Against this background, an impulsive (in 0.1 seconds
or less) increase in the current-aligned plasma velocity occurs at the site of
the current-layer thinning (sausage-type deformation, or $m=0$ pinch
instability). Such a ""velocity burst"" can be interpreted physically as an event
of suprathemal-proton generation. Further development of the sausage
instability results in an increase in the kinetic temperature of the protons to
high values, even to those observed in flares. The form of our system of MHD
equations indicates that such increases are a property of the exact solution of
the system at an appropriate choice of the parameters. Magnetic reconnection
does not manifest itself in this solution: it would generate flows forbidden by
the chosen geometry. Therefore, the pinch-sausage effect can act as an
energiser of the upper chromosphere and be an alternative to the
magnetic-reconnection process as the producer of flares.

explore how the evolution of the system depends on the shock radius, $R_S$, and
velocity, $V_S$ (in addition to other global properties of the system). We do
so through a phase space analysis of the shock acceleration, $a_S$, in the
$R_S-V_S$ plane, shown to provide quantitative insights into the initiation of
runaway expansion and its nature. In the particular case of an initially
stationary ($V_S=0,\;a_S=0$) profile, the prospects for an explosion can be
reasonably assessed by the initial signs of the partial derivatives of the
shock acceleration, in analogy to a linear damped/anti-damped oscillator. If
$\partial a_S/\partial R_S<0$ and $\partial a_S/\partial V_S>0$, runaway
expansion will likely occur after several oscillations, while if $\partial
a_S/\partial R_S>0$, runaway expansion will commence in a non-oscillatory
fashion. These two modes of runaway correspond to low and high mass accretion
rates, respectively. We also use the quasi-stationary approximation to assess
the advection-to-heating timescale ratio in the gain region, often used as an
explosion proxy. Indeed, this ratio does tend to $\sim1$ in conjunction with
runaway conditions, but neither this unit value nor the specific choice of the

from numerical relativity simulations of bubble collisions in one space and one
time dimension. This method tiles comoving hypersurfaces with locally-perturbed
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinate patches. The method extends previous
work, which was limited to the spacetime region just inside the future light
cone of the collision, and allows us to explore the full bubble-collision
spacetime. We validate our new methods against previous work, and present a
full set of predictions for the comoving curvature perturbation and local
negative spatial curvature produced by identical and non-identical bubble
collisions, in single scalar field models of eternal inflation. In both
collision types, there is a non-zero contribution to the spatial curvature and
cosmic microwave background quadrupole. Some collisions between non-identical
bubbles excite wall modes, giving extra structure to the predicted temperature
anisotropies. We comment on the implications of our results for future
observational searches. For non-identical bubble collisions, we also find that
the surfaces of constant field can readjust in the presence of a collision to
produce spatially infinite sections that become nearly homogeneous deep into

has become known as the strong coupling limit of an `excitonic insulator.'
While these `weak' and `strong' coupling extremes were subsequently proposed to
be manifestations of the same excitonic state of electronic matter, the
predicted continuity of such a phase across a band gap opening has not been
realized experimentally in any material. Here we show the quantum limit of
graphite, by way of temperature and angle-resolved magnetoresistance
measurements, to host such an excitonic insulator phase that evolves
continuously between the weak and strong coupling limits. We find that the
maximum transition temperature T_EI of the excitonic phase is coincident with a
band gap opening in the underlying electronic structure at B_0= 46 +/- 1 T,
which is evidenced above T_EI by a thermally broadened inflection point in the
magnetoresistance. The overall asymmetry of the observed phase boundary around
B_0 closely matches theoretical predictions of a magnetic field-tuned excitonic
insulator phase in which the opening of a band gap marks a crossover from
predominantly momentum-space pairing to real-space pairing.

convection the upper bounds are for heat transport versus Rayleigh number. As
might be expected, the stochastic upper bounds are larger than the
deterministic counterpart of \citet{Doering15}, but their variation with noise
amplitude exhibits interesting behavior. Below the transition to chaotic
dynamics the upper bounds increase monotonically with noise amplitude. However,
in the chaotic regime this monotonicity depends on the number of realizations
in the ensemble; at a particular Rayleigh number the bound may increase or
decrease with noise amplitude. The origin of this behavior is the coupling
between the noise and unstable periodic orbits, the degree of which depends on
the degree to which the ensemble represents the ergodic set. This is confirmed
by examining the close returns plots of the full solutions to the stochastic
equations and the numerical convergence of the noise correlations. The
numerical convergence of both the ensemble and time averages of the noise
correlations is sufficiently slow that it is the limiting aspect of the
realization of these bounds. Finally, we note that the full solutions of the

information on carbon stocks obtained through three-dimensional analysis of

incorporates the diversity of plant forms measured in plots, transects, and
relev\'es. Stored carbon in any vegetation type is usually calculated as half
the biomass of sampled individuals, estimated with allometric formulas. The
most complete of these formulas incorporate diameter, height, and specific
gravity of wood but do not consider the variation in carbon stored in different
organs or different species, nor do they include information on the wide array
of architectures present in different plant communities. To develop these
allometric models, many individuals of different species must be sacrificed to
identify and validate samples and to minimize error. It is common to find
cutting-edge studies that encourage logging to improve estimates of carbon. In
our approach we replace this destructive methodology with a new technique for
quantifying global aboveground carbon. We demonstrate that carbon content in
forest aboveground biomass in the pantropics could rise to 723.97 Pg C. This

  The notion of pseudo-collars originated in Hilbert cube manfold theory, where
it was part of a necessary and suffcient condition for placing a Z-set as the
boundary of an open Hilbert cube manifold. We are interested in pseudo-collars
on finite-dimensional manifolds for the same reason, attempting to put a Z-set
as the boundary of an open high-dimensional manifold.

There, it is established the local character of the approximation and how, with

\{\alpha_{1,2},\gamma_{1,2},\tau_{1,2},\lambda\} with frequency, Ap_{2}HN can
describe a perfect fit with the objective function, \psi_{\beta}. Such

  Two new sets of models for describing compactly the Fourier Transform of

at the cost of a more complicated dependency with the low frequencies than
1+(i\omega\tau_{HN})^{\alpha}.

selection, arising as a building block in a number of game-theoretic
applications: Given a function $g$ from the $n$-dimensional hypercube to the
bounded interval $[-1,1]$, and an $n \times m$ matrix $A$ with bounded entries,
maximize $g(Ax)$ over $x$ in the $m$-dimensional simplex. This problem arises
naturally when one seeks to design a lottery over items for sale in an auction,
or craft the posterior beliefs for agents in a Bayesian game through the
provision of information (a.k.a. signaling).
  We present an approximation algorithm for this problem when $g$
simultaneously satisfies two smoothness properties: Lipschitz continuity with
respect to the $L^\infty$ norm, and noise stability. The latter notion, which
we define and cater to our setting, controls the degree to which
low-probability errors in the inputs of $g$ can impact its output. When $g$ is
both $O(1)$-Lipschitz continuous and $O(1)$-stable, we obtain an (additive)
PTAS for mixture selection. We also show that neither assumption suffices by
itself for an additive PTAS, and both assumptions together do not suffice for
an additive FPTAS.
  We apply our algorithm to different game-theoretic applications from
mechanism design and optimal signaling. We make progress on a number of open
problems suggested in prior work by easily reducing them to mixture selection:
we resolve an important special case of the small-menu lottery design problem
posed by Dughmi, Han, and Nisan; we resolve the problem of revenue-maximizing
signaling in Bayesian second-price auctions posed by Emek et al. and Miltersen

the inner part of the Galactic plane. After the subtraction of point-like
contributions, the remaining $\gamma$-ray spectrum can provide important hints
about the cosmic-ray (CR) population in that region. In particular, the diffuse
spectrum measured by both Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. in the Galactic Ridge is
significantly harder with respect to the rest of the Galaxy. These results were
recently interpreted in terms of a comprehensive CR transport model which,
adopting a spatial dependent diffusion coefficient and convective velocity,
reproduces Fermi-LAT results on the whole sky as well as local CR spectra. We
showed as that model predicts a significantly harder neutrino diffuse emission
compared to conventional scenarios: The predicted signal is able to account for
a significant fraction of the astrophysical flux measured by IceCube. In this
contribution, we use the same setup to calculate the expected neutrino flux
from several windows in the inner Galactic plane and compare the results with
IceCube observations and the sensitivities of Mediterranean neutrino
telescopes. In particular, for the ANTARES experiment, we compare the model

this density and ubiquity of capillaries are often called space-filling. There

biologically adaptive structures by requiring too much construction material or
space, delivering resources too slowly, or using too much power to move blood

humans and 1 mouse) and compare these observations with predictions of model
networks that are space-filling and constrained by a few guiding biological
principles. We devise a numerical method that enables the investigation of
space-filling strategies and determination of which biological principles
influence network structure. Optimization for only a single principle creates
unrealistic networks that represent an extreme limit of the possible structures
that could be observed in nature. We first study these extreme limits for two
competing principles, minimal total material and minimal path lengths. We
combine these two principles and enforce various thresholds for balance in the

theory. The Exact Renormalization Group is applied to a world sheet theory
describing string propagation in a general background involving both massless
and massive modes. This gives interacting equations of motion for the modes of
the string. Loop variable techniques are used to obtain gauge invariant
equations. Since this method is not tied to flat space time or any particular
background metric, it is manifestly background independent. The technique can
be applied to both open and closed strings. Thus gauge invariant and generally
covariant interacting equations of motion can be written for massive higher
spin fields in arbitrary backgrounds. Some explicit examples are given.

analysed for various light-field intensities and frequency detunings. The
results of conducted quantum analysis have revealed noticeable differences from

extreme event statistics of waiting times between rainy days (leading to
droughts for very long dry periods) we obtain from the observed
near-exponential decay of waiting times an extreme event statistics close to
Gumbel distributions. We discuss superstatistical dynamical systems as simple

to construct an Eulerian trail such that the length of the shortest subcycle is
as long as possible. A more general approach to constructing the encoding

realistic wireless channel capacities are stochastic bearing time-varying
statistics, necessitating the redesign and solution of NUM problems to capture
such effects. Based on NUM theory we develop a framework for scheduling,
routing, congestion and power control in wireless multihop networks that
considers stochastic Long or Short Term Fading wireless channels. Specifically,
the wireless channel is modeled via stochastic differential equations
alleviating several assumptions that exist in state-of-the-art channel modeling
within the NUM framework such as the finite number of states or the
stationarity. Our consideration of wireless channel modeling leads to a NUM
problem formulation that accommodates non-convex and time-varying utilities. We
consider both cases of non orthogonal and orthogonal access of users to the
medium. In the first case, scheduling is performed via power control, while the
latter separates scheduling and power control and the role of power control is
to further increase users' optimal utility by exploiting random reductions of
the stochastic channel power loss while also considering energy efficiency.
Finally, numerical results evaluate the performance and operation of the
proposed approach and study the impact of several involved parameters on
convergence.

that problem, which in turn are known to upper bound the price of anarchy in
certain games with dynamically changing populations.
  We show several results. We fully characterize the coordination complexity
for the problem of computing a many-to-one matching in a bipartite graph by
giving almost matching lower and upper bounds.Our upper bound in fact extends
much more generally, to the problem of solving a linearly separable convex
program. We also give a different upper bound technique, which we use to bound
the coordination complexity of coordinating a Nash equilibrium in a routing
game, and of computing a stable matching.

statistical evidence of five discrete kinematic overdensities among $67$ of the
fastest-moving stars, and compare them to high-resolution N-body simulations of
the interaction between a Milky-Way like galaxy and orbiting dwarf galaxies
with four representative cases of merging histories. The observed overdensities
can be interpreted as fossil substructures consisting of streamers torn from
their progenitors, such progenitors appear to be satellites on prograde and
retrograde orbits on different inclinations. In particular, of the five
detected overdensities, two appear to be associated, yelding twenty-one
additional main-sequence members, with the stream of Helmi et al. (1999) that
our analysis confirms on a high inclination prograde orbit. The three newly
identified kinematic groups could be associated with the retrograde streams
detected by Dinescu (2002) and Kepley et al. (2007), whatever their origin, the
progenitor(s) would be on retrograde orbit(s) and inclination(s) within the

$A_{\rm FB}(M_{t\bar{t}}>650\, {\rm GeV})$ is smaller than $A_{\rm

indicate an ""increasing-decreasing"" behavior for $A_{\rm

conventional renormalization scale-setting, even by a next-to-next-to-leading
order (N$^2$LO) QCD calculation -- one predicts a monotonically increasing
behavior. In the conventional scale-setting method, one simply guesses a single
renormalization scale $\mu_r$ for the argument of the QCD running coupling and
then varies it over an arbitrary range. However, the conventional method has
inherent difficulties. ...... In contrast, if one fixes the scale using the
Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), the resulting pQCD predictions are
renormalization-scheme independent since all of the scheme-dependent
$\{\beta_i\}$-terms in the QCD perturbative series are resummed into the QCD
running couplings at each order. ...... In this paper we show that if one
applies the PMC to determine the top versus anti-top quark forward-backward
asymmetry by properly using the pQCD predictions up to N$^2$LO level, one
obtains the predictions without renormalization scheme or scale ambiguities.
...... In addition, the PMC prediction for $A_{\rm FB}(M_{t\bar{t}}> M_{\rm

$M_{\rm cut}$ which is not observed in the NLO and N$^2$LO predictions for

mixing in a lossy integrated microring resonator side-coupled to a channel
waveguide. A nonperturbative, analytic solution within the undepleted pump
approximation is developed for a cw pump input of arbitrary intensity. In the
strongly driven regime self- and cross-phase modulation, as well as multi-pair
generation, lead to a rich variety of power-dependent effects; the results are
markedly different than in the low power limit. The photon pair generation
rate, single photon spectrum, and joint spectral intensity (JSI) distribution
are calculated. Splitting of the generated single photon spectrum into a
doublet structure associated with both pump detuning and cross-phase modulation
is predicted, as well as substantial narrowing of the generated signal and
idler bandwidths associated with the onset of optical parametric oscillation at
intermediate powers. Both the correlated and uncorrelated contributions to the
JSI are calculated, and for sufficient powers the uncorrelated part of the JSI
is found to form a quadruplet structure. The pump detuning is found to play a
crucial role in all of these phenomena, and a critical detuning is identified
which divides the system behaviour into distinct regimes, as well as an optimal
detuning strategy which preserves many of the low-power characteristics of the
generated photons for arbitrary input power.

characterize the distribution of irreducible representations in the non-free

the distribution. In particular, we show how the asymptotic distribution of the
