scenario. We assume that a massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) accretes
matter coming from a companion star, making it to spin at the critical rate. We
assume uniform rotation due to magnetic field coupling. The carbon ignition
mass for non-rotating WDs is M_{ig}^{NR} \approx 1.38 M_{\odot}; while for the
case of uniformly rotating WDs it is a few percent larger (M_{ig}^{R} \approx
1.43 M_{\odot}). When accretion rate decreases, the WD begins to lose angular
momentum, shrinks, and spins up; however, it does not overflow its critical
rotation rate, avoiding mass shedding. Thus, angular momentum losses can lead
the CO WD interior to compression and carbon ignition, which would induce an
SN~Ia. The delay, largely due to the angular momentum losses timescale, may be
large enough to allow the companion star to evolve to a He WD, becoming
undetectable at the moment of explosion. This scenario supports the occurrence
of delayed SNe~Ia if the final CO WD mass is 1.38 M_{\odot} < M < 1.43
M_{\odot}. We also find that if the delay is longer than ~3 Gyr, the WD would
become too cold to explode, rather undergoing collapse.

subject to a budget on the maximal absolute correlation between the features

over the past 10-15 years, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Optimization
(MILO) approach to obtain certifiably optimal global solutions to this
nonconvex optimization problem. The current state of algorithmics in integer
optimization makes our proposal substantially more computationally attractive
than the least squares subset selection framework based on integer quadratic
optimization, recently proposed in [8] and the continuous nonconvex quadratic
optimization framework of [33]. We propose new discrete first-order methods,
which when paired with state-of-the-art MILO solvers, lead to good solutions
for the Discrete Dantzig Selector problem for a given computational budget. We
illustrate that our integrated approach provides globally optimal solutions in
significantly shorter computation times, when compared to off-the-shelf MILO
solvers. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that in a wide range
of regimes the statistical properties of the Discrete Dantzig Selector are
superior to those of popular $\ell_{1}$-based approaches. We illustrate that
our approach can handle problem instances with p = 10,000 features with
certifiable optimality making it a highly scalable combinatorial variable

rotation. We focus on the cluster NGC 1856, showing a splitting in the upper
part of the main sequence, well visible in the color m_{F336W}-m_{F555W}$, and
a very wide turnoff region. Using population synthesis available from the
Geneva stellar models, we show that the cluster data can be interpreted as
superposition of two main populations having the same age (~350Myr), composed
for 2/3 of very rapidly rotating stars, defining the upper turnoff region and
the redder main sequence, and for 1/3 of slowly/non-rotating stars. Since rapid
rotation is a common property of the B-A type stars, the main question raised
by this model concerns the origin of the slowly/non-rotating component. Binary
synchronization is a possible process behind the slowly/non-rotating
population; in this case, many slowly/non-rotating stars should still be part
of binary systems with orbital periods in the range from 4 to 500 days. Such
periods imply that Roche lobe overflow occurs, during the evolution of the
primary off the main sequence, so most primaries may not be able to ignite core

dipoles are ""unconditionally passive"" in that their Amperian magnetic dipole
moments are zero in the absence of applied fields. The analysis of paramagnetic
continua, whose magnetization is caused by the alignment of randomly oriented
""permanent"" Amperian magnetic dipole moments that dominate any induced
diamagnetic magnetization, is greatly simplified by first proving that the
microscopic power equations for rotating ""permanent"" Amperian magnetic dipoles

the same power equations obeyed by rotating unconditionally passive

adding the macroscopic energy provided by the usual liquid drop model with its
parameters fitted through the least square root and minimax criteria.

estimated clusters with a clear statistical interpretation. We take this view
here and introduce the class of G-block covariance models as a background model
for variable clustering. In such models, two variables in a cluster are deemed
similar if they have similar associations will all other variables. This can
arise, for instance, when groups of variables are noise corrupted versions of
the same latent factor. We quantify the difficulty of clustering data generated
from a G-block covariance model in terms of cluster proximity, measured with
respect to two related, but different, cluster separation metrics. We derive
minimax cluster separation thresholds, which are the metric values below which
no algorithm can recover the model-defined clusters exactly, and show that they
are different for the two metrics. We therefore develop two algorithms, COD and
PECOK, tailored to G-block covariance models, and study their
minimax-optimality with respect to each metric. Of independent interest is the
fact that the analysis of the PECOK algorithm, which is based on a corrected
convex relaxation of the popular K-means algorithm, provides the first
statistical analysis of such algorithms for variable clustering. Additionally,
we contrast our methods with another popular clustering method, spectral
clustering, specialized to variable clustering, and show that ensuring exact
cluster recovery via this method requires clusters to have a higher separation,
relative to the minimax threshold. Extensive simulation studies, as well as our

chaotic. We point out the severe repercussions: differentiable Dirac
observables and a reduced phase space do not exist in non-integrable
constrained systems and are thus unlikely to occur in a generic general
relativistic context. Instead, gauge invariant quantities generally become
discontinuous, thus not admitting Poisson-algebraic structures and posing
serious challenges to a quantization. Non-integrability also renders the
paradigm of relational dynamics cumbersome, thereby straining common
interpretations of the dynamics. We illustrate these conceptual and technical
challenges with simple toy models. In particular, we exhibit reparametrization
invariant models which fail to be integrable and, as a consequence, can either
not be quantized with standard methods or lead to sick quantum theories without
a semiclassical limit. These troubles are qualitatively distinct from
semiclassical subtleties in unconstrained quantum chaos and can be directly
traced back to the scarcity of Dirac observables. As a possible resolution, we
propose to change the method of quantization by refining the configuration
space topology until the generalized observables become continuous in the new
topology and can acquire a quantum representation. This leads to the polymer
quantization method underlying loop quantum cosmology and gravity. Remarkably,
the polymer quantum theory circumvents the problems of the quantization with
smooth topology, indicating that non-integrability and chaos, while a
challenge, may not be a fundamental obstruction for quantum gravity.

Spectra from the Wide Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3 m telescope to provide
spectroscopy across the whole object covering the spectral range 3400-7000
{\AA}. We formed narrow-band images to investigate the excitation structure.
The spectral analysis shows that the object is a distant Peimbert Type I PN of
low excitation, formally of excitation class of 0.5. The low electron density,
high dynamical age, and low surface brightness of the object confirm that it is
observed fairly late in its evolution. It shows clear evidence for dredge-up of
CN-processed material characteristic of its class. In addition, the low
peculiar velocity of 7 km s$^{-1}$ shows it to be a member of the young disk
component of our Galaxy. We built a self-consistent photoionisation model for
the PNe matching the observed spectrum, the H$\beta$ luminosity, and the
diameter. On the basis of this we derive an effective temperature $\log T_{\rm
eff} \sim 5.05$ and luminosity $1.85 < \log L < 2.25$. The temperature is much
higher than might have been expected using the excitation class, proving that
this can be misleading in classifying evolved PNe. PN G342.0-01.7 is in
interaction with its surrounding interstellar medium through which the object
is moving in the south-west direction. This interaction drives a slow shock
into the outer PN ejecta. A shock model suggests that it only accounts for
about 10\% of the total luminosity, but has an important effect on the global
spectrum of the PN.

Previous works in this direction, however, mainly focus on the single-node case
without considering strict resource constraints. In this paper, a
game-theoretic model for protecting a system of multiple nodes against stealthy
attacks is proposed. We consider the practical setting where the frequencies of
both attack and defense are constrained by limited resources, and an asymmetric
feedback structure where the attacker can fully observe the states of nodes
while largely hiding its actions from the defender. We characterize the best
response strategies for both attacker and defender in the space of both
non-adaptive and adaptive strategies, and study the Nash Equilibria of the
game. We further study a sequential game where the defender first announces its
strategy and the attacker then responds accordingly, and design an algorithm
that finds a nearly optimal strategy for the defender to commit to.

Assigning tasks to several workers to increase quality through redundant
answers can be expensive if asking homogeneous sources. This limitation has
been overlooked by current crowdsourcing platforms resulting therefore in
costly solutions. In order to achieve desirable cost-quality tradeoffs it is
essential to apply efficient crowd access optimization techniques. Our work
argues that optimization needs to be aware of diversity and correlation of
information within groups of individuals so that crowdsourcing redundancy can
be adequately planned beforehand. Based on this intuitive idea, we introduce
the Access Path Model (APM), a novel crowd model that leverages the notion of
access paths as an alternative way of retrieving information. APM aggregates
answers ensuring high quality and meaningful confidence. Moreover, we devise a
greedy optimization algorithm for this model that finds a provably good
approximate plan to access the crowd. We evaluate our approach on three
crowdsourced datasets that illustrate various aspects of the problem. Our
results show that the Access Path Model combined with greedy optimization is
cost-efficient and practical to overcome common difficulties in large-scale
crowdsourcing like data sparsity and anonymity.

region, with similar structure and morphology. A series of at least eight
homologous flares occurred in active region NOAA 11237 over 16 - 17 June 2011.
A nearby prominence/filament was rooted in the active region, and situated near
the bottom of a coronal cavity. The active region was on the southeast solar
limb as seen from SDO/AIA, and on the disk as viewed from STEREO/EUVI-B. The
dual perspective allows us to study in detail behavior of the
prominence/filament material entrained in the magnetic field of the
repeatedly-erupting system. Each of the eruptions was mainly confined, but
expelled hot material into the prominence/filament cavity system (PFCS). The
field carrying and containing the ejected hot material interacted with the PFCS
and caused it to inflate, resulting in a step-wise rise of the PFCS
approximately in step with the homologous eruptions. The eighth eruption
triggered the PFCS to move outward slowly, accompanied by a weak coronal
dimming. As this slow PFCS eruption was underway, a final ejective flare
occurred in the core of the active region, resulting in strong dimming in the
EUVI-B images and expulsion of a coronal mass ejection (CME). A plausible
scenario is that the repeated homologous flares could have gradually
destabilized the PFCS, and its subsequent eruption removed field above the
acitive region and in turn led to the ejective flare, strong dimming, and CME.

both of these entropies obey Maxwell's equal area law to an accuracy of around
1 %. Moreover, we checked this for a wide range of size of the spherical
entangling region, and the equal area law holds independently of the size. We
also checked the equal area law for AdS-RN in 4 and 5 dimensions, so the
conclusion is not specific to a particular dimension. Finally, we repeated the
same procedure for a similar, van der Waals-like transition of the dyonic black
hole in AdS in a mixed ensemble (fixed electric potential and fixed magnetic

abundance and disk surface brightness in the W1 band obtained for spiral

sawtooth' crashes in reverse magnetic shear tokamak configurations. Recently
differential rotation provided by equilibrium sheared flows has been shown
capable of decoupling the two DTM resonant layers, slowing the growth the
instability. In this work we instead supply this differential rotation using an
electron diamagnetic drift, which emerges in the presence of an equilibrium
pressure gradient and finite Larmor radius physics. Diamagnetic drifts have the
additional benefit of stabilizing reconnection local to the two tearing layers.
Conducting linear and nonlinear simulations with the extended MHD code MRC-3d,
we consider an m=2, n=1 cylindrical double-tearing mode. We show that
asymmetries between the resonant layers and the emergence of an ideal MHD
instability cause the DTM evolution to be highly dependent on the location of
the pressure gradient. By locating a strong drift near the outer, dominant
resonant surface are we able to saturate the mode and preserve the annular
current ring, suggesting that the appearance of DTM activity in advanced
tokamaks depends strongly on the details of the plasma pressure profile.

problem in computational biology. Modern data sets often contain a large number
of genes, which can complicate the reconstruction problem due to the fact that
different genes may undergo different evolutionary histories. This is the case
in particular in the presence of horizontal genetic transfer (HGT), where a
gene is inherited from a distant species rather than an immediate ancestor.
Such an event produces a gene tree which is distinct from, but related to, the
species phylogeny.
  In previous work, a natural stochastic models of HGT was introduced and
studied. It was shown, both in simulation and theoretical studies, that a
species phylogeny can be reconstructed from gene trees despite surprisingly
high rates of HGT under this model. Rigorous lower and upper bounds on this
achievable rate were also obtained, but a large gap remained. Here we close
this gap, up to a constant. Specifically we show that a species phylogeny can
be reconstructed correctly from gene trees even when, on each gene, each edge
of the species tree has a constant probability of being the location of an HGT
event. Our new reconstruction algorithm, which relies only on unrooted gene
tree topologies, builds the tree recursively from the leaves and runs in
polynomial time.
  We also provide a matching bound in the negative direction (up to a constant)
and extend our results to some cases where gene trees are not perfectly known.

excitations at the vacuum-surface interface of a superlattice of $N$ graphene

graphite which allows inter-layer hopping. A dispersion function is derived
which incorporates the polarization function of the graphene monolayers (MLGs)
and the dispersion function of a semi-infinite electron liquid at whose surface
the electrons scatter specularly. We find that this surface plasmon-polariton
is not damped by the particle-hole excitations (PHE's) or the bulk modes and
separates below the continuum mini-band of bulk plasmon modes. For a conducting
substrate with surface plasmon frequency $\omega_s=\omega_p/\sqrt{2}$, the
surface plasmon frequency of the hybrid structure always lies below $\omega_s$.
The intensity of this mode depends on the distance of the graphene layers from
the surface of the conductor, the energy band gap between the valence and
conduction bands of MLG and, most importantly, on the number of two-dimensional
(2D) layers. Furthermore, the hybrid structure has no surface plasmon for a
sufficiently large number ($N\stackrel{>}{\sim} 7$) of layers. The existence of
two plasmons with different dispersion relations indicates that quasiparticles
with different group velocity may coexist for various ranges of wavelength
which is determined by the number of layers in the superlattice.

fundamental problem in computational biology. Stochastic models of sequence
evolution are closely related to spin systems that have been extensively

insights on the theoretical properties of phylogenetic reconstruction
algorithms as well as the development of new inference methods. Here, we study
maximum likelihood, a classical statistical technique which is perhaps the most
widely used in phylogenetic practice because of its superior empirical
accuracy.
  At the theoretical level, except for its consistency, that is, the guarantee
of eventual correct reconstruction as the size of the input data grows, much
remains to be understood about the statistical properties of maximum likelihood
in this context. In particular, the best bounds on the sample complexity or
sequence-length requirement of maximum likelihood, that is, the amount of data
required for correct reconstruction, are exponential in the number, $n$, of
tips---far from known lower bounds based on information-theoretic arguments.
Here we close the gap by proving a new upper bound on the sequence-length
requirement of maximum likelihood that matches up to constants the known lower
bound for some standard models of evolution.
  More specifically, for the $r$-state symmetric model of sequence evolution on
a binary phylogeny with bounded edge lengths, we show that the sequence-length
requirement behaves logarithmically in $n$ when the expected amount of mutation
per edge is below what is known as the Kesten-Stigum threshold. In general, the
sequence-length requirement is polynomial in $n$. Our results imply moreover
that the maximum likelihood estimator can be computed efficiently on randomly

accounts for interest rates. Our model optimizes the number, size, and spacing
between expenditures in order to minimize the NPC required for the network to
achieve a desired operational lifetime. In general this optimization problem is
non-convex, but if the spacing between expenditures is linearly proportional to
the size of the expenditures, and the number of maintenance cycles is known in
advance, the problem becomes convex and can be solved to global optimality. If
non-deferrable recurring costs are low, then evenly spacing the expenditures
can provide near-optimal results. With the provided models and methods, network
operators can now derive a payment schedule to minimize NPC while accounting

solution $u$ of the above equation that is trapped in between self-similar
solutions of the form of $t^{-\alpha} f_i(t^{-\beta}x)$, $i=1,2$, with initial
value $u_0$ satisfying $A_1|x|^{-\gamma}\le u_0\le A_2|x|^{-\gamma}$ for some
constants $A_2>A_1>0$ and $\frac{2}{1-m}<\gamma<\frac{n-2}{m}$, where
$\beta:=\frac{1}{2-\gamma(1-m)}$, $\alpha:=\frac{2\beta-1}{1-m},$ and the
self-similar profile $f_i$ satisfies the elliptic equation $$ \Delta f^m+\alpha
f+\beta x\cdot \nabla f=0\quad \mbox{in ${\mathbb R}^n\setminus\{0\}$} $$ with
$\lim_{|x|\to0}|x|^{\frac{ \alpha}{ \beta}}f_i(x)=A_i$ and
$\lim_{|x|\to\infty}|x|^{\frac{n-2}{m}}{f_i}(x)= D_{A_i} $ for some constants
$D_{A_i}>0$. When $\frac{2}{1-m}<\gamma<n$, under an integrability condition on
the initial value $u_0$ of the singular solution $u$, we prove that the
rescaled function $$ \tilde u(y,\tau):= t^{\,\alpha} u(t^{\,\beta} y,t),\quad{
\tau:=\log t}, $$ converges to some self-similar profile $f$ as
$\tau\to\infty$.

realize the local dS invariance of the matter field, two kinds of conservation
laws are derived. The first kind is a differential equation for a dS-covariant
current, which unites the canonical energy-momentum (EM) and angular momentum

conserved in the sense that its torsion-free divergence vanishes. The
dS-invariant current unites the total (matter plus gravity) EM and AM currents.
It is well known that the AM current contains an inherent part, called the spin

which might be observed by its contribution to the deviation of the dust
particle's world line from a geodesic. All the results are compared to the

collective cellular dynamics via a number of signaling pathways. Here, we
investigate the mechanical response of a model biopolymer network due to the
active contraction of embedded cells. Specifically, a graph (bond-node) model
derived from confocal microscopy data is used to represent the network
microstructure, and cell contraction is modeled by applying correlated
displacements at specific nodes, representing the focal adhesion sites. A
force-based stochastic relaxation method is employed to obtain force-balanced
network under cell contraction. We find that the majority of the forces are
carried by a small number of heterogeneous force chains emitted from the
contracting cells. The force chains consist of fiber segments that either
possess a high degree of alignment before cell contraction or are aligned due
to the reorientation induced by cell contraction. Large fluctuations of the
forces along different force chains are observed. Importantly, the decay of the
forces along the force chains is significantly slower than the decay of
radially averaged forces in the system. These results suggest that the fibrous
nature of biopolymer network structure can support long-range force
transmission and thus, long-range mechanical signaling between cells.

ultimate quantum improvement. One of the most destructive decoherence-type
noise is uncorrelated Markovian noise which commutes with the
parameter-encoding Hamiltonian and is modelled as a semigroup dynamics, for
which the quantum improvement is constrained to a constant factor. It has been
shown [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{109}, 233601 (2012)] that when the noisy time
evolution is governed by a local and non-semigroup dynamics (e.g., induced by
an uncorrelated non-Markovian dephasing), emerging the Zeno regime at short
times can result in the Zeno scaling in the precision. Here, by considering the
impact of the correlated noise in metrology, we show that spatially correlated
environments which lead to a nonlocal and non-semigroup dynamics can improve
the precision of a noisy frequency measurement beyond the Zeno scaling. In
particular, it is demonstrated that one can find decoherence-free subspaces and
subsequently achieve the Heisenberg precision scaling for an approximated

electromagnetic waves. The solution of motion equation of a single electron
indicates that by including the ionization, the electron with higher residual
energy compared to the case without ionization could be obtained. In agreement
with chaotic nature of the motion, it is found that the electron residual
energy will significantly be changed by applying a minor change to the initial
conditions. Extensive kinetic 1D-3V particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have
been performed in order to resolve full plasma reactions. In this way, two
different regimes of plasma behavior are observed by varying the pulse length.
The results indicate that the amplitude of scattered fields in sufficient long
pulse length is high enough to act as a second counter-propagating wave for
triggering the stochastic electron motion. On the other hand, the analyses of
intensity spectrum reveal this fact that the dominant scattering mechanism
tends to Thomson rather Raman scattering by increasing the pulse length. A
covariant formalism is used to describe the plasma heating so that it enables
us to measure electron temperature inside the pulse region.

by considering the characteristics in the spatial variation of neutron flux
from the spallation target, we propose a multi-point measurement technique,
i.e. the spallation neutron flux should be measured at multiple vertical
locations. To explain why the flux should be measured at multiple locations, we
have studied neutron production from a tungsten target bombarded by a 250
MeV-proton beam with Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation
results indicate that the neutron flux at the central location is up to three
orders of magnitude higher than the flux at lower locations. Secondly, we have
developed an effective technique in order to measure the spallation neutron
flux with a fission chamber (FC), by establishing the relation between the
fission rate measured by FC and the spallation neutron flux. Since this
relation is linear for a FC, a constant calibration factor is used to derive
the neutron flux from the measured fission rate. This calibration factor can be
extracted from the energy spectra of spallation neutrons. Finally, we have
evaluated the proposed calibration method for a FC in the environment of an ADS
system. The results indicate that the proposed method functions very well.

determinant of the pertinent Riemannian metric and another non-Riemannian
volume-form independent of the Riemannian metric, defined in terms of an
auxiliary antisymmetric tensor gauge field of maximal rank. Integration of the
equations of motion of the latter auxiliary gauge field produce an a priori
arbitrary integration constant that plays the role of a dynamically generated
cosmological constant or dark energy. Moreover, the above modified scalar field
action turns out to possess a hidden Noether symmetry whose associated
conserved current describes a pressureless ""dust"" fluid which we can identify
with the dark matter completely decoupled from the dark energy. The form of
both the dark energy and dark matter that results from above class of models is
insensitive to the specific form of the scalar field Lagrangian. By adding
appropriate perturbation, which breaks the above hidden symmetry and along with
this it couples dark matter and dark energy, we also suggest a way to obtain

magnetic coherent states, in this paper such energy scale is related to a
dynamical process associated with the Andreev scattering of an electron

This energy scale is then used to obtain an improved scaling collapse of
numerically calculated thermal Hall conductivity in a tight-binding model as a

(foraminifera) and geochemical ({\delta}13C) sea-level indicators preserved in
dated cores of salt-marsh sediment. Our model is comprised of three modules:
(1) A Bayesian transfer function for the calibration of foraminifera into tidal
elevation, which is flexible enough to formally accommodate additional proxies
(in this case bulk-sediment {\delta}13C values); (2) A chronology developed
from an existing Bchron age-depth model, and (3) An existing
errors-in-variables integrated Gaussian process (EIV-IGP) model for estimating
rates of sea-level change. We illustrate our approach using a case study of
Common Era sea-level variability from New Jersey, U.S.A. We develop a new
Bayesian transfer function (B-TF), with and without the {\delta}13C proxy and
compare our results to those from a widely-used weighted-averaging transfer
function (WA-TF). The formal incorporation of a second proxy into the B-TF
model results in smaller vertical uncertainties and improved accuracy for
reconstructed RSL. The vertical uncertainty from the multi-proxy B-TF is ~28%
smaller on average compared to the WA-TF. When evaluated against historic
tide-gauge measurements, the multi-proxy B-TF most accurately reconstructs the
RSL changes observed in the instrumental record (MSE = 0.003). The holistic
model provides a single, unifying framework for reconstructing and analysing
sea level through time. This approach is suitable for reconstructing other

problem of network de-anonymization, in which nodes (users) participating to
more than one social network are identified only by means of the structure of
their links to other members. This procedure exploits an initial set of seed
nodes large enough to trigger a percolation process which correctly matches
almost all other nodes across the different social networks. Our main
contribution is to show the crucial role played by clustering, which is a
ubiquitous feature of realistic social network graphs (and many other systems).
Clustering has both the effect of making matching algorithms more vulnerable to
errors, and the potential to dramatically reduce the number of seeds needed to
trigger percolation, thanks to a wave-like propagation effect. We demonstrate
these facts by considering a fairly general class of random geometric graphs
with variable clustering level, and showing how clever algorithms can achieve
surprisingly good performance while containing matching errors.

(CA-SCL) decoding can outperform the turbo codes and the LDPC codes when code
lengths are configured to be several kilobits. In order to reduce the decoding
complexity, a novel tree-pruning scheme for the \mbox{SCL/CA-SCL} decoding
algorithms is proposed in this paper. In each step of the decoding procedure,
the candidate paths with metrics less than a threshold are dropped directly to
avoid the unnecessary computations for the path searching on the descendant
branches of them. Given a candidate path, an upper bound of the path metric of
its descendants is proposed to determined whether the pruning of this candidate
path would affect frame error rate (FER) performance. By utilizing this upper
bounding technique and introducing a dynamic threshold, the proposed scheme
deletes the redundant candidate paths as many as possible while keeping the
performance deterioration in a tolerant region, thus it is much more efficient
than the existing pruning scheme. With only a negligible loss of FER
performance, the computational complexity of the proposed pruned decoding
scheme is only about $40\%$ of the standard algorithm in the low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region (where the FER under CA-SCL decoding is
about $0.1 \sim 0.001$), and it can be very close to that of the successive
cancellation (SC) decoder in the moderate and high SNR regions.

appear in SNe Ia with smaller decline rates (e.g., dm15(B)<1.4 mag), clarifying
that the finding by Childress et al. (2014) for the Ca-HVFs in
near-maximum-light spectra applies both to the Si-HVFs and Ca-HVFs in the
earlier phase. The Si-HVFs seem to be more common in fast-expanding SNe Ia,
which is different from the earlier result that the Ca-HVFs are associated with
SNe Ia having slower SiII 6355 velocities at maximum light (i.e., Vsi). This
difference can be due to that the HVFs in fast-expanding SNe Ia usually
disappear more rapidly and are easily blended with the photospheric components
when approaching the maximum light. Moreover, SNe Ia with both stronger HVFs at
early phases and larger Vsi are found to have noticeably redder B-V colors and
occur preferentially in the inner regions of their host galaxies, while those
with stronger HVFs but smaller Vsi show opposite tendencies, suggesting that
these two subclasses have different explosion environments and their HVFs may
have different origins. We further examine the relationships between the
absorption features of SiII 6355 and CaII IR lines, and find that their
photospheric components are well correlated in velocity and strength but the
corresponding HVFs show larger scatter. These results cannot be explained with
ionization and/or thermal processes alone, and different mechanisms are
required for the creation of HVF-forming region in SNe Ia.

  long range dependence","35 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.PR math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by empirical data on real world complex networks, the last few years
have seen an explosion in proposed generative models to understand and explain
observed properties of real world networks, including power law degree
distribution and ""small world"" distance scaling. In this context, a natural
question is the phenomenon of {\it change point}, understanding how abrupt
changes in parameters driving the network model change structural properties of
the network. We study this phenomenon in one popular class of dynamically
evolving networks: preferential attachment models. We derive asymptotic
properties of various functionals of the network including the degree
distribution as well as maximal degree asymptotics, in essence showing that the
change point does effect the degree distribution but does {\bf not} change the
degree exponent. This provides further evidence for long range dependence and
sensitive dependence of the evolution of the process on the initial evolution
of the process in such self-reinforced systems. We then propose an estimator
for the change point and prove consistency properties of this estimator. The
methodology developed highlights the effect of the non-ergodic nature of the
evolution of the network on classical change point estimators.

  should Hawking's predictions be recovered?","11 pages, 6 figures",,,"LPT-Orsay-15-60","gr-qc physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We reexamine the scattering coefficients of shallow water waves blocked by a
stationary counter current over an obstacle. By considering series of
background flows, we show that the most relevant parameter is $F_{\rm max}$,
the maximal value of the ratio of the flow velocity over the speed of low
frequency waves. For subcritical flows, i.e., $F_{\rm max} < 1$, there is no
analogue Killing horizon and the mode amplification is strongly suppressed.
Instead, when $F_{\rm max} \gtrsim 1.1$, the amplification is enhanced at low
frequency and the spectrum closely follows Hawking's prediction. We further
study subcritical flows close to that used in the Vancouver experiment. Our
numerical analysis suggests that their observation of the ""thermal nature of
the mode conversion"" is due to the relatively steep slope on the upstream side
and the narrowness of the obstacle.

hemisphere, which is rapidly reducing the existing north-south asymmetry in the
census of MW satellites and other stellar substructure. We use the first-year
DES data down to previously unprobed photometric depths to search for stellar
systems in the Galactic halo, therefore complementing the previous analysis of
the same data carried out by our group earlier this year. Our search is based
on a matched filter algorithm that produces stellar density maps consistent
with stellar population models of various ages, metallicities, and distances
over the survey area. The most conspicuous density peaks in these maps have
been identified automatically and ranked according to their significance and
recurrence for different input models. We report the discovery of one
additional stellar system besides those previously found by several authors
using the same first-year DES data. The object is compact, and consistent with
being dominated by an old and metal-poor population. DES J0034-4902 is found at
high significance and appears in the DES images as a compact concentration of
faint blue point sources at ~ 87 {kpc}. Its half-light radius of r_h = 9.88 +/-
4.31 {pc} and total luminosity of M_V ~ -3.05_{-0.42}^{+0.69} are consistent
with it being a low mass halo cluster. It is also found to have a very
elongated shape. In addition, our deeper probe of DES 1st year data confirms
the recently reported satellite galaxy candidate Horologium II as a significant
stellar overdensity. We also infer its structural properties and compare them
to those reported in the literature.

(e.g. chemical reactions, metal rust, yeast, amoeba, heart, brain) generate
geometrically similar macroscopic waves(1,2). For the heart and brain, the
spatiotemporal patterns formed by these excitation waves separate healthy from
diseased states(1-3). Current electrical and pharmacological therapies for
bioelectric disorders often lack the necessary spatiotemporal precision needed
to control these patterns. Optical methodologies have the potential to overcome
these limitations, but have only been demonstrated in simple systems, e.g. the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) chemical reaction4. Here we combine novel dye-free
optical imaging with optogenetic actuation for dynamic control of cardiac
excitation waves. We leverage patterned light to optically control emergent
macroscopic properties of cardiac tissue: wave direction, wave speed, and
spiral wave chirality. This all-optical approach offers a fundamentally new
experimental platform for the study and control of pattern formation in complex
biological excitable systems.

equilibrium dynamics in condensed matter. A new spectrometer recently proposed
for ultra-high-resolution IXS (UHRIX) has achieved 0.6~meV and 0.25~nm$^{-1}$
spectral and momentum transfer resolutions, respectively. However, further
improvements down to 0.1~meV and 0.02~nm$^{-1}$ are required to close the gap
in energy-momentum space between high and low frequency probes. We show that
this goal can be achieved by further optimizing the X-ray optics and by
increasing the spectral flux of the incident X-ray pulses. UHRIX performs best
at energies from 5 to 10 keV, where a combination of self-seeding and undulator
tapering at the SASE-2 beamline of the European XFEL promises up to a
hundred-fold increase in average spectral flux compared with nominal SASE
pulses at saturation, or three orders of magnitude more than possible with
storage-ring based radiation sources. Wave-optics propagation shows that about
$7\times 10^{12}$~ph/s in a $90$-$\mu$eV bandwidth can be achieved on the
sample. This will provide unique new possibilities for dynamics studies by IXS.

a holistic answer to human evolution. There are two questions regarding
bipedalism: i) why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal? and ii) why
did hominins become increasingly bipedal over time and replace their less
bipedal ancestors? To answer these questions, the prominent theories in the
field, such as the savanna-based theory, the postural feeding hypotheses, and
the provisioning model, are collectively examined. Because biological evolution
is an example of trial and error and not a simple causation, there may be
multiple answers to the evolution of bipedalism. The postural feeding
hypothesis (reaching for food/balancing) provides an explanation for the
partial bipedalism of the earliest hominins. The savannah-based theory
describes how the largely bipedal hominins that started to settle on the ground
became increasingly bipedal. The provisioning model (food-gathering/monogamy)
explains questions arising after the postural feeding hypothesis and before the
savannah theory in an evolutionary timeline. Indeed, there are no straight
lines between the theories, and multiple forces could have pushed the evolution
of bipedalism at different points. Finally, this manuscript states that the
arboreal hominins that possessed ambiguous traits of bipedalism were eliminated
through choice and selection. Using the biological analogy of the okapi and
giraffe, I explain how one of the branches (Homo) became increasingly bipedal
while the other (Pan) adapted to locomotion for forest life by narrowing the
anatomical/biological focus in evolution.
