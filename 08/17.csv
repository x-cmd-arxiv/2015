distributed by the Apache TinkerPop project. Gremlin, as a graph traversal
machine, is composed of three interacting components: a graph $G$, a traversal
$\Psi$, and a set of traversers $T$. The traversers move about the graph
according to the instructions specified in the traversal, where the result of
the computation is the ultimate locations of all halted traversers. A Gremlin
machine can be executed over any supporting graph computing system such as an
OLTP graph database and/or an OLAP graph processor. Gremlin, as a graph
traversal language, is a functional language implemented in the user's native
programming language and is used to define the $\Psi$ of a Gremlin machine.
This article provides a mathematical description of Gremlin and details its
automaton and functional properties. These properties enable Gremlin to
naturally support imperative and declarative querying, host language
agnosticism, user-defined domain specific languages, an extensible
compiler/optimizer, single- and multi-machine execution models, hybrid depth-

important problem with many applications in database systems and machine
learning. Relational learning algorithms learn the definition of a new relation
in terms of existing relations in the database. Nevertheless, the same data set
may be represented under different schemas for various reasons, such as
efficiency, data quality, and usability. Unfortunately, the output of current
relational learning algorithms tends to vary quite substantially over the
choice of schema, both in terms of learning accuracy and efficiency. This
variation complicates their off-the-shelf application. In this paper, we
introduce and formalize the property of schema independence of relational
learning algorithms, and study both the theoretical and empirical dependence of
existing algorithms on the common class of (de) composition schema
transformations. We study both sample-based learning algorithms, which learn
from sets of labeled examples, and query-based algorithms, which learn by
asking queries to an oracle. We prove that current relational learning
algorithms are generally not schema independent. For query-based learning
algorithms we show that the (de) composition transformations influence their
query complexity. We propose Castor, a sample-based relational learning
algorithm that achieves schema independence by leveraging data dependencies. We
support the theoretical results with an empirical study that demonstrates the
schema dependence/independence of several algorithms on existing benchmark and
real-world datasets under (de) compositions.

techniques aim to identify a mapping $f: \mathbb{R}^q \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$
with $k \ll q$ such that $Y|f(X)$ is independent of $X$. The image $f(X)$
summarizes the relevant information in a potentially large number of covariates
$X$ that influence the responses $Y$. In many contemporary settings, the number
of responses $p$ is also quite large, in addition to a large number $q$ of
covariates. This leads to the challenge of fitting a succinctly parameterized
statistical model to $Y|f(X)$, which is a problem that is usually not addressed
in a traditional SDR framework. In this paper, we present a computationally
tractable convex relaxation based estimator for simultaneously (a) identifying
a linear dimension reduction $f(X)$ of the covariates that is sufficient with
respect to the responses, and (b) fitting several types of structured
low-dimensional models -- factor models, graphical models, latent-variable
graphical models -- to the conditional distribution of $Y|f(X)$. We analyze the
consistency properties of our estimator in a high-dimensional scaling regime.
We also illustrate the performance of our approach on a newsgroup dataset and
on a dataset consisting of financial asset prices.

cosmological bulk flow, $\bf B$, from the observed radial peculiar velocities
of galaxies. A distinction is made between two theoretical definitions of $\bf
B$ as a dipole moment of the velocity field weighted by a radial window
function. One definition involves the three dimensional (3D) peculiar velocity,
while the other is based on its radial component alone. Different methods
attempt at inferring $\bf B$ for either of these definitions which coincide
only for a constant velocity field. We focus on the Wiener Filtering (WF,
Hoffman et al. 2015) and the Constrained Minimum Variance (CMV,Feldman et al.
2010) methodologies. Both methodologies require a prior expressed in terms of
the radial velocity correlation function. Hoffman et al. compute $\bf B$ in
Top-Hat windows from a WF realization of the 3D peculiar velocity field.
Feldman et al. infer $\bf B$ directly from the observed velocities for the
second definition of $\bf B$. The WF methodology could easily be adapted to the
second definition, in which case it will be equivalent to the CMV with the
exception of the imposed constraint. For a prior with vanishing correlations or
very noisy data, CMV reproduces the standard Maximum Likelihood (ML, Kaiser
1988) estimation for $\bf B$ of the entire sample independent of the radial
weighting function. Therefore, this estimator is likely more susceptible to
observational biases that could be present in measurements of distant galaxies.
Finally, two additional estimators are proposed.

  transport using diffusion equations","9 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1063/1.4942836",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding ballistic phonon transport effects in transient
thermoreflectance experiments and explaining the observed deviations from
classical theory remains a challenge. Diffusion equations are simple and
computationally efficient but are widely believed to break down when the
characteristic length scale is similar or less than the phonon mean-free-path.
Building on our prior work, we demonstrate how well-known diffusion equations,
namely the hyperbolic heat equation and the Cattaneo equation, can be used to
model ballistic phonon effects in frequency-dependent periodic steady-state
thermal transport. Our analytical solutions are found to compare excellently to
rigorous numerical results of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The
correct physical boundary conditions can be different from those traditionally
used and are paramount for accurately capturing ballistic effects. To
illustrate the technique, we consider a simple model problem using two
different, commonly-used heating conditions. We demonstrate how this framework
can easily handle detailed material properties, by considering the case of bulk
silicon using a full phonon dispersion and mean-free-path distribution. This
physically transparent approach provides clear insights into the nonequilibrium
physics of quasi-ballistic phonon transport and its impact on thermal transport
properties.

algorithm learns online what is the optimal prediction and time to issue a
prediction based on past history of students' performance in a course. We
derive a confidence estimate for the prediction accuracy and demonstrate the

approximately 700 UCLA undergraduate students who have taken an introductory

tachyonic de Sitter thick braneworld which possesses a series of appealing

(instead of being asymptotically dS or AdS) even when it contains a negative
bulk cosmological constant, a relevant 3-brane with dS metric which naturally
arises from the full set of field equations of the 5D background (it is not
imposed), qualitatively describing the inflationary epochs of our Universe, and
a graviton spectrum with a single zero mode bound state that accounts for the
4D graviton localised on the brane and is separated from the continuum of
Kaluza-Klein massive graviton excitations by a mass gap. Gauge vector fields
with a single massless bound state in its mass spectrum are also localised on
this braneworld model a fact that allows us to recover the Coulomb's law of our
4D world. All these properties of the above referred tachyonic braneworld

For the special case of one unreliable client, we derive a closed-form

approaching 1 as the number of packets tends to infinity). Furthermore, for the
cases with more than one unreliable client, we provide an approximation
solution in which the number of transmissions per packet is within an

repetition rates via pulsing an input direct current (dc) electron beam are
provided. The device and the method are based on an electromagnetic-mechanical
pulser (EMMP) that consists of a series of transverse deflecting cavities and
magnetic quadrupoles. The EMMP modulates and chops the incoming dc electron
beam and converts it into pico- and sub-pico-second (100 fs to 10 ps) electron
pulse sequences at >1 GHz repetition rates. Applying the EMMP to a transmission
electron microscope (TEM) with any dc electron source, a GHz stroboscopic
high-duty-cycle TEM can be realized. Unlike in many recent developments in
time-resolved TEM that rely on a sample pumping laser paired with a laser
launching electrons from a photocathode to probe the sample, there is no laser
in the presented experimental set-up. This is expected to be a significant
relief for electron microscopists who are not familiar with laser systems. The
EMMP and the sample are externally driven by a radiofrequency (RF) source
synchronized through a delay line. With no laser pumping the sample, the
problem of the laser induced residual heating/damaging the sample is
eliminated. As many RF-driven processes can be cycled indefinitely, sampling
rates of 1-50 GHz become accessible. Such a GHz stroboscopic TEM would open up
a new paradigm for in situ and in operando experiments to study samples
externally driven electromagnetically. Complementary to the lower (MHz)
repetition rates experiments enabled by laser photocathode TEM, new experiments
in the high rep-rate multi-GHz regime will be enabled by the proposed RF
design. In this article, we report an optimal design of the EMMP and an
analytical generalized matrix approach in the thin lens approximation, along
with detailed beam dynamics taking actual realistic dc beam parameters in a TEM
operating at 200 keV.

quarks are produced by the PYTHIA event generator tuned to fit the transverse
momentum spectrum and rapidity distribution of charm quarks from Fixed-Order
Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculations. The produced charm quarks
scatter in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) with the off-shell partons whose masses
and widths are given by the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM), which
reproduces the lattice QCD equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. The
relevant cross sections are calculated in a consistent way by employing the
effective propagators and couplings from the DQPM. Close to the critical energy
density of the phase transition, the charm quarks are hadronized into $D$
mesons through coalescence and/or fragmentation. The hadronized $D$ mesons then
interact with the various hadrons in the hadronic phase with cross sections
calculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy-quark spin symmetry.
The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $D^0$
mesons from PHSD are compared with the experimental data from the STAR
Collaboration for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV and to the ALICE
data for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =2.76 TeV. We find that in the
PHSD the energy loss of $D$ mesons at high $p_T$ can be dominantly attributed
to partonic scattering while the actual shape of $R_{AA}$ versus $p_T$ reflects
the heavy-quark hadronization scenario, i.e. coalescence versus fragmentation.
Also the hadronic rescattering is important for the $R_{AA}$ at low $p_T$ and
enhances the $D$-meson elliptic flow $v_2$.

map with a published Faraday depth map of the entire Galaxy in this direction,
we derive the Faraday depth introduced by the NPS and the Galactic interstellar
medium (ISM) in front of and behind the NPS. The Faraday depth contributed by
the NPS is close to zero, indicating that the NPS is an emitting only feature.
The Faraday depth caused by the ISM in front of the NPS is consistent with zero
at b>50 degree, implying that this part of the NPS is local at a distance of
approximately several hundred parsecs. The Faraday depth contributed by the ISM
behind the NPS gradually increases with Galactic latitude up to b=44 degree,
and decreases at higher Galactic latitudes. This implies that either the part
of the NPS at b<44 degree is distant or the NPS is local but there is a sign
change of the large-scale magnetic field. If the NPS is local, there is then no
evidence for a large-scale anti-symmetry pattern in the Faraday depth of the

b>50 degree can be explained by including a coherent vertical magnetic field.

$\mathcal{V}_n$ comprising $n$ vertices, where $\overrightarrow{a}$ is a
probability vector $(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m)$ and $\overrightarrow{K_n}$ is
$(K_{1,n},K_{2,n},\ldots,K_{m,n})$. This graph has been studied in the
literature including a most recent work by Ya\u{g}an [arXiv:1508.02407].
Suppose there is a pool $\mathcal{P}_n$ consisting of $P_n$ distinct objects.
The $n$ vertices in $\mathcal{V}_n$ are divided into $m$ groups $\mathcal{A}_1,
\mathcal{A}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{A}_m$. Each vertex $v$ is independently
assigned to exactly a group according to the probability distribution with
$\mathbb{P}[v \in \mathcal{A}_i]= a_i$, where $i=1,2,\ldots,m$. Afterwards,
each vertex in group $\mathcal{A}_i$ independently chooses $K_{i,n}$ objects
uniformly at random from the object pool $\mathcal{P}_n$. Finally, an
undirected edge is drawn between two vertices in $\mathcal{V}_n$ that share at
least one object. This graph model $\mathbb{G}(n,\overrightarrow{a},

complementary strengths of probabilistic graphical models and declarative
programming to represent and reason with logic-based and probabilistic
descriptions of uncertainty and domain knowledge. An action language is
extended to support non-boolean fluents and non-deterministic causal laws. This
action language is used to describe tightly-coupled transition diagrams at two
levels of granularity, with a fine-resolution transition diagram defined as a
refinement of a coarse-resolution transition diagram of the domain. The
coarse-resolution system description, and a history that includes (prioritized)
defaults, are translated into an Answer Set Prolog (ASP) program. For any given
goal, inference in the ASP program provides a plan of abstract actions. To
implement each such abstract action, the robot automatically zooms to the part
of the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to this action. A
probabilistic representation of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation is
then included in this zoomed fine-resolution system description, and used to
construct a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The policy
obtained by solving the POMDP is invoked repeatedly to implement the abstract
action as a sequence of concrete actions, with the corresponding observations
being recorded in the coarse-resolution history and used for subsequent
reasoning. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robot
moving objects in an indoor domain, to show that it supports reasoning with
violation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions, in complex
domains.

  However, formal methods are not yet mainstream, and it is questionable if
formal verification, especially formal deduction, can be integrated into the

results on quantification of personalization over Google search query results.
Inspired by previous works, we have carried out some experiments consisting of

increased the difficulties of securing accesses to systems' resources. To

systems. Among the different access control approaches proposed in the last
decades, the policy-based one permits to capture, by resorting to the concept
of attribute, all systems' security-relevant information and to be, at the same
time, sufficiently flexible and expressive to represent the other approaches.
In this paper, we move a step further to understand the effectiveness of
policy-based specifications by studying how they permit to enforce traditional
security properties. To support system designers in developing and maintaining
policy-based specifications, we formalise also some relevant properties

  BiFeO3",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetic ordering, as one of the most important characteristics in magnetic
materials, could have significant influence on the band structure, spin
dependent transport, and other important properties of materials. Its
measurement, especially for the case of antiferromagnetic ordering, however, is
generally difficult to be achieved. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of
magnetic ordering detection using a noncontact and nondestructive optical
method. Taking the compressive strained tetragonal BiFeO3 (BFO) as an example
and combining density functional theory calculations with the minimal one-band
tight-binding models, we find that when BFO changes from C1-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase to G-type AFM phase, the top of valance band
shifts from the Z point to {\Gamma} point, which makes the original direct band
gap become indirect. This can be explained by the two-center Slater-Koster
parameters using the Harrison approach. The impact of magnetic ordering on
energy band dispersion dramatically changes the optical properties of
tetragonal BFO. For the linear ones, the energy shift of the optical band gap
could be as large as 0.4 eV. As for the nonlinear ones, the change is even
larger. The second-harmonic generation coefficient d33 of G-AFM becomes more
than 13 times smaller than that of C1-type AFM case. Finally, we propose a
practical way to distin-guish the C1- and G-type AFM of BFO using the optical
method, which might be of great importance in next-generation information
storage technologies and widens the potential application of BFO to optical
switch.

One of possible approaches to separability conditions is connected with upper
bounds on the sum of maximal probabilities. Separability conditions are often
formulated for measurements that have a special structure. For instance,
mutually unbiased bases and mutually unbiased measurements can be utilized for

result of rapid energy deposition in the chromosphere. These have been observed
as blueshifts in X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) spectral lines
corresponding to upward motions at a few tens to a few hundreds of km/s. Past
spectroscopic observations have also revealed a dominant stationary component,
in addition to the blueshifted component, in emission lines formed at high
temperatures (~10 MK). This is contradictory to evaporation models predicting
predominant blueshifts in hot lines. The recently launched Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) provides high resolution imaging and spectroscopic
observations that focus on the chromosphere and transition region in the UV

observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer, we study the chromospheric
evaporation process from the upper chromosphere to corona during an X1.0 flare

Doppler shifts and line broadening, at two flare ribbons separating from each
other, suggesting that chromospheric evaporation takes place in successively
formed flaring loops throughout the flare. More importantly, we detect dominant
blueshifts in the high temperature Fe XXI line (~10 MK), in agreement with
theoretical predictions. We also find that, in this flare, gentle evaporation
occurs at some locations in the rise phase of the flare, while explosive
evaporation is detected at some other locations near the peak of the flare.
There is a conversion from gentle to explosive evaporation as the flare
evolves.

designed for Android and iOS handsets. The app was configured to simultaneously
broadcast via BLE and perform periodic discovery scans for other nearby
devices. The app was installed on two Android handsets and two iOS handsets,
and each combination of devices was tested in the foreground, background and
locked states. Connectivity was successfully measured in all test cases, except
between two iOS devices when both were in a locked state with their screens
off. As smartphones are in a locked state for the majority of a day, this
severely limits the ability to measure social connectivity on users' own
smartphones. It is not currently feasible to use Bluetooth Low Energy to map
social networks, due to the inability of iOS devices to detect another iOS
device when both are in a locked state. While the technology was successfully

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) can provide the potential Gbps traffic for wireless

matrix is leveraged to reduce the required cost and complexity of transceiver
with a negligible performance loss. One key feature of the proposed scheme is
that the macro-cell BS can simultaneously support multiple small-cell BSs with
multiple streams for each smallcell BS, which is essentially different from
conventional hybrid precoding/combining schemes typically limited to
single-user MIMO with multiple streams or multi-user MIMO with single stream

with antiferromagnetic couplings. For this model there have been conflicting
results for the existence of the columnar dimer phase, which was predicted on
the basis of weak coupling field theory renormalisation group arguments. The
numerical work on this model has been based on various approaches, including
exact diagonalization, series expansions and density-matrix renormalization
group calculations. Using the recently developed tensor network states and
ground-state fidelity approach for quantum spin ladders we find no evidence for
the existence of the columnar dimer phase. We also provide an argument based on
the symmetry of the Hamiltonian which suggests that the phase diagram for
antiferromagnetic couplings consists of a single line separating the
rung-singlet and Haldane phases.

its static and dynamical features using Monte Carlo simulations with Kawasaki
spin exchange dynamics that conserves the order parameter. We show that at
thermodynamical equilibrium, due to strong inter-layer correlations, the system
forms a continuous columnar structure for any finite interaction across
adjacent layers. Furthermore, the phase separation shows a faster dynamics as
the inter-layer interaction is increased. This temporal behavior is mainly due
to an effective deeper temperature quench because of the larger value of the
critical temperature, $T_{\rm c}$, for larger inter-layer interaction. When the
temperature ratio, $T/T_{\rm c}$, is kept fixed, the temporal growth exponent
does not increase and even slightly decreases as function of the increased
inter-layer interaction, as the system crosses-over from two to three
dimensions.

reactor antineutrinos at multiple baselines leading to the discovery of
$\bar{\nu}_e$ oscillations over km-baselines. Subsequent data has provided the
world's most precise measurement of $\rm{sin}^22\theta_{13}$ and the effective
mass splitting $\Delta m_{ee}^2$. The experiment is located in Daya Bay, China
where the cluster of six nuclear reactors is among the world's most prolific
sources of electron antineutrinos. Multiple antineutrino detectors are deployed
in three underground water pools at different distances from the reactor cores
to search for deviations in the antineutrino rate and energy spectrum due to
neutrino mixing. Instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), the water
pools serve as shielding against natural radioactivity from the surrounding
rock and provide efficient muon tagging. Arrays of resistive plate chambers
over the top of each pool provide additional muon detection. The antineutrino
detectors were specifically designed for measurements of the antineutrino flux
with minimal systematic uncertainty. Relative detector efficiencies between the
near and far detectors are known to better than 0.2%. With the unblinding of
the final two detectors' baselines and target masses, a complete description
and comparison of the eight antineutrino detectors can now be presented. This
paper describes the Daya Bay detector systems, consisting of eight antineutrino
detectors in three instrumented water pools in three underground halls, and
their operation through the first year of eight detector data-taking.

certain curves in the space of affine lattices and in moduli spaces of
translation surfaces. We also prove applications of these results to dynamical
billiards, mathematical physics and number theory. In the space of affine
lattices $ASL_2(\mathbb{R})/ASL_2( \mathbb{Z})$, we prove that almost every
point on a curve with some non-degeneracy assumptions is Birkhoff generic for
the geodesic flow. This implies almost everywhere genericity for some curves in
the locus of branched covers of the torus inside the stratum $\mathcal{H}(1,1)$
of translation surfaces. For these curves (and more in general curves which are
well-approximated by horocycle arcs and satisfy almost everywhere Birkhoff
genericity) we also prove that almost every point is Oseledets generic for the
Kontsevitch-Zorich cocycle, generalizing a recent result by Chaika and Eskin.
As applications, we first consider a class of pseudo-integrable billiards,
billiards in ellipses with barriers, which was recently explored by Dragovic
and Radnovic, and prove that for almost every parameter, the billiard flow is
uniquely ergodic within the region of phase space in which it is trapped. We
then consider any periodic array of Eaton retroreflector lenses, placed on
vertices of a lattice, and prove that in almost every direction light rays are
each confined to a band of finite width. This generalizes a phenomenon recently
discovered by Fraczek and Schmoll which could so far only be proved for random
periodic configurations. Finally, a result on the gap distribution of
fractional parts of the sequence of square roots of positive integers, which
extends previous work by Elkies and McMullen, is also obtained.

multilevel solvers for systems of Helmholtz equations. Both grid spacing and
arithmetics may comprise complex numbers and we thus can apply complex scaling
techniques to the indefinite Helmholtz operator. Our implementations are based
upon the notion of a spacetree and work exclusively with a finite number of
precomputed local element matrices. They are globally matrix-free.
  Combining various relaxation factors with two grid transfer operators allows
us to switch from pure additive multigrid over a hierarchical basis method into
BPX with several multiscale smoothing variants within one code base. Pipelining
allows us to realise a full approximation storage (FAS) scheme within the
additive environment where, amortised, each grid vertex carrying degrees of
freedom is read/written only once per iteration. The codes thus realise a
single-touch policy. Among the features facilitated by matrix-free FAS is
arbitrary dynamic mesh refinement (AMR) for all solver variants. AMR as enabler
for full multigrid (FMG) cycling---the grid unfolds throughout the
computation---allows us to reduce the cost per unknown per order of accuracy.
  The present paper primary contributes towards software realisation and design
questions. Our experiments show that the consolidation of single-touch FAS,
dynamic AMR and vectorisation-friendly, complex scaled, matrix-free FMG cycles
delivers a mature implementation blueprint for solvers for a non-trivial class
of problems such as Helmholtz equations. Besides this validation, we put
particular emphasis on a strict implementation formalism as well as some
implementation correctness proofs.

tendons whose fascicles have a helical arrangement of fibrils is derived. The
stress-strain response of a single fascicle whose fibrils exhibit varying
levels of crimp throughout its radius is calculated and used to determine the
form of the strain energy function. The new constitutive law is used to model
uniaxial extension test data for human patellar tendon and is shown to provide
an excellent fit, with the average relative error being 9.8%. It is then used
to model shear and predicts that the stresses required to shear a tendon are
much smaller than those required to uniaxially stretch it to the same strain
level. Finally, the strain energy function is used to model ligaments and
tendons whose fascicles are helical, and the relative effects of the fibril
helix angle, the fascicle helix angle and the fibril crimp variable are
compared. It is shown that they all have a significant effect; the fibril crimp
variable governs the non-linearity of the stress-strain curve, whereas the
helix angles primarily affect its stiffness. Smaller values of the helix angles
lead to stiffer tendons; therefore, the model predicts that one would expect to
see fewer helical sub-structures in stiff positional tendons, and more in those
that are required to be more flexible.

identified via two assumptions related to the transformability of the system

perturbation expansion of the non-equilibrium density matrix for calculation of

finite temperature. As a model for our study, the high-temperature

the studied system, and of the corresponding Eliashberg function that

derived temperature-dependent relaxation dynamics as a function of delay time
between the pump and probe pulses. For the studied model system of MgB2, we
have shown that an abrupt increase of the relaxation time at Tc, as detected by

coupling in transition from an adiabatic to a stabilized superconducting
anti-adiabatic state, as it predicts the anti-adiabatic theory of
electron-vibration interactions. The BCS model, which preserves the adiabatic

continuity surface are investigated. It is shown that, for a given mass flux
through a discontinuity, its type depends only on the relation between inclina-
tion angles of a magnetic field. Moreover, the conservation laws on a surface
of discontinuity allow changing a discontinuity type with gradual (continu-
ous) changes in the conditions of plasma flow. Then there are the so-called
transition solutions that satisfy simultaneously two types of discontinuities.
We obtain all transition solutions on the basis of the complete system of
boundary conditions for the MHD equations. We also found the expression
describing a jump of internal energy of the plasma flowing through the dis-
continuity. Firstly, this allows constructing a generalized scheme of possible
continuous transitions between MHD discontinuities. Secondly, it enables the
examination of the dependence of plasma heating by plasma density and
configuration of the magnetic field near the discontinuity surface, i.e., by
the type of the MHD discontinuity. It is shown that the best conditions for
heating are carried out in the vicinity of a reconnecting current layer near
the areas of reverse currents. The result can be helpful in explaining the
temperature distributions inside the active regions in the solar corona during
flares observed by modern space observatories in soft and hard X-rays.

evolution of filament cross-sections at the outboard midplane and investigates
the scaling of the centre of mass velocity of the filament cross-section with
filament width and electron temperature. By decoupling the vorticity equation
into even and odd parity components about the centre of the filament in the
bi-normal direction parallel density gradients are shown to drive large
velocities in the bi-normal (approximately poloidal) direction which scale
linearly with electron temperature. In this respect increasing the electron
temperature causes a departure of the filament dynamics from 2D behaviours.
Despite the strong impact of 3D effects the radial motion of the filament is
shown to be relatively well predicted by 2D scalings. The radial velocity is
found to scale positively with both electron temperature and cross-sectional
width, suggesting an inertially limited nature. Comparison with the two-region
model [J. R. Myra et.al, Phys.Plasmas, 13 (2006) 112502] achieves reasonable
agreement when using a corrected parallel connection length due to the neglect
of diamagnetic currents driven in the divertor region of the filament. Analysis

CaF-Li and CaF-Rb collisions, using model Lennard-Jones potentials adjusted to
give typical values for the s-wave scattering length. Together with trajectory
calculations, these differential cross sections are used to simulate the
cooling of the molecules, the heating of the atoms, and the loss of atoms from

Our simulations suggest that Rb is a more effective coolant than Li for
ground-state molecules, and that the cooling dynamics are less sensitive to the
exact value of the s-wave scattering length when Rb is used. Using realistic
experimental parameters, we find that molecules can be sympathetically cooled

Bohmian mechanics, a hydrodynamic formulation of the quantum theory, which is
currently trying to open new pathways of understanding. Specifically, the

connected to the central grid, microgrid can usher in great benefits in terms
of cost efficiency, power reliability, and environmental awareness. Economic
dispatching is a central problem in microgrid operation, which aims at
effectively scheduling various energy sources to minimize the operating cost
while satisfying the electricity demand. Designing intelligent economic
dispatching strategies for microgrids, however, is drastically different from
that for conventional central grids, due to two unique challenges. First, the
erratic renewable energy emphasizes the need for online algorithms. Second, the
widely-adopted peak-based pricing scheme brings out the need for new peak-aware
strategy design. In this paper, we tackle these critical challenges and devise
peak-aware online economic dispatching algorithms. For microgrids with
fast-responding generators, we prove that our deterministic and randomized
algorithms achieve the best possible competitive ratios $2-\beta$ and
$e/(e-1+\beta)$, respectively, where $\beta\in[0,1]$ is the ratio between the
minimum grid spot price and the local-generation price. Our results
characterize the fundamental \emph{price of uncertainty} of the problem. For
microgrids with slow-responding generators, we first show that a large
competitive ratio is inevitable. Then we leverage limited prediction of
electricity demand and renewable generation to improve the competitiveness of
the algorithms. By extensive empirical evaluations using real-world traces, we
show that our online algorithms achieve near offline-optimal performance. In a
representative scenario, our algorithm achieves $17.5\%$ and $9.24\%$ cost
reduction as compared to the case without local generation units and the case
using peak-oblivious algorithms, respectively.

leave a consistent global discrepancy of about a factor of two. It has been
proposed, within the minimalist and purist MOND, that clusters harbor some
indigenous, yet-undetected, cluster baryonic (dark) matter (CBDM). Its total
amount has to be comparable with that of the observed hot gas. Following an
initial discovery by van Dokkum & al. (2015a), Koda & al. (2015) have recently
identified more than a thousand ultra-diffuse galaxy-like objects (UDGs) in the
Coma cluster. Robustness of the UDGs to tidal disruption seems to require,
within Newtonian dynamics, that they are much more massive than their observed
stellar component. Here, I propound that a considerable fraction of the CBDM is
internal to UDGs, which endows them with robustness. The rest of the CBDM
objects formed in now-disrupted kin of the UDGs, and is dispersed in the
intracluster medium. While the discovery of cluster UDGs is not in itself a
resolution of the MOND cluster conundrum, it lends greater qualitative
plausibility to CBDM as its resolution, for reasons I discuss. Alternatively,
if the UDGs are only now falling into Coma, their large size and very low
surface brightness could result from the adiabatic inflation due to the MOND
external-field effect, as described in Brada & Milgrom (2000). I also consider
briefly solutions to the conundrum that invoke more elaborate extensions of
purist MOND, e.g., that in clusters, the MOND constant takes up
larger-than-canonical values of the MOND constant.

the persistent deviation from the approximately zonally symmetric jet to the
emergence of blocking patterns. Such configurations are usually connected to
exceptional local stability properties of the flow which come along with an
improved local forecast skills during the phenomenon. It is instead extremely
hard to predict onset and decay of blockings. Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)
offer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,
since they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis
which explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess
whether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine
the CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel
baroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\Delta T$. An
orographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We
detect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the
periodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest
growing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the
circulation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in
the finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is
attributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high
temperature gradients, while for low values of \Delta T, the effect is only due
to stronger barotropic instability. In order to determine the localization of
the CLVs we compare the meridionally averaged variance of the CLVs during
blocked and unblocked phases. We find that on average the variance of the CLVs
is clustered around the center of blocking. These results show that the blocked
flow affects all time scales and processes described by the CLVs.

bivouac, is a fascinating example of collective motion in nature. During such
raids ants lay pheromones to form trails for others to find a food source. In
this work a coupled PDE/ODE model is introduced to study ant dynamics and
pheromone concentration. The key idea is the introduction of two forms of ant
dynamics: foraging and returning, each governed by different environmental and
social cues. The model accounts for all aspects of the raiding cycle including
local collisional interactions, the laying of pheromone along a trail, and the
transition from one class of ants to another. Through analysis of an order
parameter measuring the orientational order in the system, the model shows
self-organization into a collective state consisting of lanes of ants moving in
opposite directions as well as the transition back to the individual state once
the food source is depleted matching prior experimental results. This indicates
that in the absence of direct communication ants naturally form an efficient
method for transporting food to the nest/bivouac. The model exhibits a
continuous kinetic phase transition in the order parameter as a function of
certain system parameters. The associated critical exponents are found,
shedding light on the behavior of the system near the transition.

this paper, we estimate head pose and eye pose from monocular video using

eye pose versus just using head pose? Second, are there individual-specific
gaze strategies that strongly correlate with how much gaze classification
improves with the addition of eye pose information? We answer these questions
by evaluating data drawn from an on-road study of 40 drivers. The main insight
of the paper is conveyed through the analogy of an ""owl"" and ""lizard"" which

When the head moves a lot (""owl""), not much classification improvement is
attained by estimating eye pose on top of head pose. On the other hand, when
the head stays still and only the eyes move (""lizard""), classification accuracy
increases significantly from adding in eye pose. We characterize how that

always averted once back-reaction from the particle's own gravity is properly
taken into account. We focus on nonspinning, uncharged, massive particles
thrown in along the equatorial plane, and work in the first-order self-force
approximation (i.e., we include all relevant corrections to the particle's
acceleration through linear order in the ratio, assumed small, between the
particle's energy and the black hole's mass). Our calculation is a numerical
implementation of a recent analysis by two of us [Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 91},

formulated for the capture scenario, involving certain self-force quantities
calculated on the one-parameter family of unstable circular geodesics in the

and for the finite-mass correction to the critical value of the impact
parameter. Here we obtain the required self-force data, and present strong
evidence to suggest that captured particles never drive the black hole beyond
its extremal limit. We show, however, that, within our first-order self-force

correction for non-Abelian anyons is complicated by the fact that it needs to

velocity. The spring extends to a stretched length as determined by the spring
mass, rest length, spring constant, rotor radius and rotor angular velocity.
When released from the rotor, the inner end of the spring pulls away as
expected, causing a wave to travel down the spring as it collapses. During this
time interval, the outer end of the spring continues to move along its original
circular path in uniform circular motion, as if the spring were still connected
to the rotor. This is analogous to the effect of a hanging Slinky released from
rest whose bottom end remains at a fixed position above the ground until a wave
from the top of the Slinky reaches the bottom of the Slinky. Values from a

inner end travels along a circle of similar radius as the outer end. The effect
appears as a series of alternating semi-circles. In addition, the simulation

pursuit (OMP) identifies the correct support of sparse signals have been
developed in the last few years. These ERC rely on the restricted isometry
property (RIP), the associated restricted isometry constant (RIC) and sometimes
the restricted orthogonality constant (ROC). In this paper, three of the most
recent ERC for OMP are examined. The contribution is to show that these ERC
remain valid for a generalization of OMP, entitled simultaneous orthogonal
matching pursuit (SOMP), that is capable to process several measurement vectors
simultaneously and return a common support estimate for the underlying sparse
vectors. The sharpness of the bounds is also briefly discussed in light of
previous works focusing on OMP.

an analogue of the famous Hadwiger's conjecture. It says that every graph with
no odd $K_t$-minor is $(t-1)$-colorable. This conjecture is known to be true
for $t \leq 5$, but the cases $t \geq 5$ are wide open. So far, the most
general result says that every graph with no odd $K_t$-minor is $O(t \sqrt{\log
t})$-colorable.
  In this paper, we tackle this conjecture from an algorithmic view, and show
the following:
  For a given graph $G$ and any fixed $t$, there is a polynomial time algorithm
to output one of the following:
  \begin{enumerate} \item a $(t-1)$-coloring of $G$, or \item an odd
$K_{t}$-minor of $G$, or \item after making all ""reductions"" to $G$, the
resulting graph $H$ (which is an odd minor of $G$ and which has no reductions)
has a tree-decomposition $(T, Y)$ such that torso of each bag $Y_t$ is either
\begin{itemize} \item of size at most $f_1(t) \log n$ for some function $f_1$
of $t$, or \item a graph that has a vertex $X$ of order at most $f_2(t)$ for
some function $f_2$ of $t$ such that $Y_t-X$ is bipartite. Moreover, degree of
$t$ in $T$ is at most $f_3(t)$ for some function $f_3$ of $t$. \end{itemize}

  Let us observe that the last odd minor $H$ is indeed a minimal counterexample
to the odd Hadwiger's conjecture for the case $t$. So our result says that a
minimal counterexample satisfies the lsat conclusion.

for the change in cohesive energy of a grain boundary of a pure metal upon
introduction of solute under conditions of equilibrium segregation prior to
fracture. A heuristic grain boundary cohesion map is presented to delineate
whether a given solute-solvent pair will exhibit weakening or strengthening of

Mysteriously, a significant part of this stress has a reversible nature: it

Although numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain these effects, the
origin of the phenomenon remains still unclear. The incorporation of atoms in
the grain boundaries is, to our opinion, the most likely mechanism, but the
required driving force for it has not yet been addressed. Therefore, instead of
searching for a specific (atomic) incorporation process, we analyze, here, the
entire film system using thermodynamic arguments only. We find that the
tremendous stress levels observed in the experiments can be surprisingly
explained by the flux induced entropic effects in the extremely dilute adatom
gas on the surface alone. This thermodynamic evaluation delivers not only the
necessary basis for the adatom incorporation models, it even shows that the
measured stress values can be reached with low deposition fluxes. Finally,
fully counterintuitive, we also show that the stress levels decrease, if the

linear measurements, sparse representations, and computationally complex
convex/greedy algorithms, we introduce a deep learning framework that supports
both linear and mildly nonlinear measurements, that learns a structured
representation from training data, and that efficiently computes a signal
estimate. In particular, we apply a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA), as an
unsupervised feature learner. SDA enables us to capture statistical
dependencies between the different elements of certain signals and improve
signal recovery performance as compared to the CS approach.

the Web. First, we find that nearly all Web content extractors do not consider
a very large, and growing, portion of modern Web pages. Second, it is well
understood that wrapper induction extractors tend to break as the Web changes;
heuristic/feature engineering extractors were thought to be immune to a Web
site's evolution, but we find that this is not the case: heuristic content
extractor performance also tends to degrade over time due to the evolution of
Web site forms and practices. We conclude with recommendations for future work
that address these and other findings.

strong dependence on the magnetization angle [Garello et al., Nature

theoretically investigate magnetization switching and domain wall motion in a
perpendicularly magnetized layer, induced by angle-dependent spin-orbit torque.
We obtain analytic expressions of the switching current and domain wall
velocity, in agreement with numerical results. Based on the expressions, we
find that the spin-orbit torque increasing with the polar angle of
magnetization is beneficial for both switching and domain wall motion. Our
result will serve as a guideline to design and interpret switching and domain
wall experiments based on spin-orbit torque.

minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which is based on an alternative
arrangement of the gauge-Higgs sector. In this effective MSSM (EffMSSM)
nonlinearly realised $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge sector is described by an
$SU(2)\times U(1)$-valued massive vector superfield, which contains a neutral
CP-even and charged Higgs fields, while another neutral CP-even Higgs and the
neutral CP-odd Higgs fields are residing in an $SU(2)\times U(1)$-singlet
chiral superfield. Although the new theory contains the same particle content
as the conventional MSSM, the unconventional representation of superfields
allows for new type of interactions, which may lead to a significant
modification of the phenomenology. As an illustrative example we consider
EffMSSM with modified Higgs and electroweak gauge sector augmented by gaugino
soft supersymmetry breaking masses, $M_i~ (i=1,2,3)$ and the Standard Higgs
soft-breaking masses, $m_{H_u}=m_{H_d}$ and $B_{\mu}$, and point out distinct
features in the Higgs and gaugino sectors as compared to MSSM. In particular,
we show that the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson with mass $\sim 125$ GeV
can be easily accommodated within EffMSSM.

and it appears when an output variable of interest is available only for a
restricted non-random sub-sample of data. We introduce an extension of the
generalized additive model which accounts for non-random sample selection by
using a selection equation. The proposed approach allows for different
distributions of the outcome variable, various dependence structures between
the (outcome and selection) equations through the use of copulae, and
nonparametric effects on the responses. Parameter estimation is carried out
within a penalized likelihood and simultaneous equation framework. We establish
asymptotic theory for the proposed penalized spline estimators, which extends
the recent theoretical results for penalized splines in generalized additive
models, such as those by Kauermann et al. (2009) and Yoshida & Naito (2014).
The empirical effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a
simulation study.

This paper molds the designing approach of user interfaces in bit different
parameters by reviewing the existing literature and proposing a different way
to develop a smart user interface to make user more familiar with the design
and to keep user 'in the flow'. Contextually proximate approach (CPA) will help
users to minimize their feeling of insecurity as designing process includes
local resources of users to develop the user interfaces. These various
