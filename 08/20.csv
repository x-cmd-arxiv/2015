is not dominated by an ordinary quark-antiquark pair, but by a four-quark
structure, is being actively investigated both theoretical and experimentally.
Such a state may be characterized as a mesonic molecule or as a
diquark-antidiquark pair. Lattice QCD provides a theoretically sound framework
to study such states. To quantitatively investigate the internal structure of
such mesons, one needs to precisely compute correlation matrices containing
several interpolating operators including two and four quarks. Here we discuss
certain technical aspects of such correlation matrices suited to study
tetraquark candidates with $J^P = 0^+$ and flavor structure $q_1 \bar{q_2} q_3
\bar{q}_3$, e.g.\ the $a_0(980)$ meson, the $D_{s0}^\ast$ meson and some of the
charged $c \bar{c}$ $X$ states. Some numerical results for the $a_0(980)$ meson
are presented.

reconstruction (AIR) method, to incorporate analytical reconstruction (AR)
method into iterative reconstruction (IR) method, for enhanced CT image quality
and reconstruction efficiency. Specifically, AIR is established based on the
modified proximal forward-backward splitting (PFBS) algorithm, and its
connection to the filtered data fidelity with sparsity regularization is
discussed. As a result, AIR decouples data fidelity and image regularization
with a two-step iterative scheme, during which an AR-projection step updates
the filtered data fidelity term, while a denoising solver updates the sparsity
regularization term. During the AR-projection step, the image is projected to
the data domain to form the data residual, and then reconstructed by certain AR
to a residual image which is then weighted together with previous image iterate
to form next image iterate. Intuitively since the eigenvalues of AR-projection
operator are close to the unity, PFBS based AIR has a fast convergence. Such an
advantage is rigorously established through convergence analysis and numerical
computation of convergence rate. The proposed AIR method is validated in the
setting of circular cone-beam CT with AR being FDK and total-variation sparsity
regularization, and has improved image quality from both AR and IR. For
example, AIR has improved visual assessment and quantitative measurement in
terms of both contrast and resolution, and reduced axial and half-fan
artifacts.

In principle, these can result in enhanced sensitivity to weak and noisy
stimuli. However, this has not yet been shown experimentally, and, little is
known about how multicellular signal processing modulates single cell
sensitivity to extracellular signaling inputs, including those guiding complex
changes in the tissue form and function. Here we explored if cell-cell
communication can enhance the ability of cell ensembles to sense and respond to
weak gradients of chemotactic cues. Using a combination of experiments with
mammary epithelial cells and mathematical modeling, we find that multicellular
sensing enables detection of and response to shallow Epidermal Growth Factor
(EGF) gradients that are undetectable by single cells. However, the advantage
of this type of gradient sensing is limited by the noisiness of the signaling
relay, necessary to integrate spatially distributed ligand concentration
information. We calculate the fundamental sensory limits imposed by this
communication noise and combine them with the experimental data to estimate the
effective size of multicellular sensory groups involved in gradient sensing.
Functional experiments strongly implicated intercellular communication through
gap junctions and calcium release from intracellular stores as mediators of
collective gradient sensing. The resulting integrative analysis provides a
framework for understanding the advantages and limitations of sensory
information processing by relays of chemically coupled cells.

phonon-mediated heat transfer in the limit of small but finite mean free path
from asymptotic solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation in the relaxation
time approximation. Our approach uses the ratio of the mean free path to the
characteristic system lengthscale, also known as the Knudsen number, as the
expansion parameter to study the effects of boundaries on the breakdown of the
Fourier descrition. We show that, in the bulk, the traditional heat conduction
equation using Fourier's law as a constitutive relation is valid at least up to
second order in the Knudsen number for steady problems and first order for
time-dependent problems. However, this description does not hold within
distances on the order of a few mean free paths from the boundary; this
breakdown is a result of kinetic effects that are always present in the
boundary vicinity and require solution of a Boltzmann boundary-layer problem to
be determined. Matching the inner, boundary layer, solution to the outer, bulk,
solution yields boundary conditions for the Fourier description as well as
additive corrections in the form of universal kinetic boundary layers; both are
found to be proportional to the bulk-solution gradients at the boundary and
parametrized by the material model and the phonon-boundary interaction model
(Boltzmann boundary condition). Our derivation shows that the traditional
no-jump boundary condition for prescribed temperature boundaries and no-flux
boundary condition for diffusely reflecting boundaries are appropriate only to
zeroth order in the Knudsen number; at higher order, boundary conditions are of
the jump type. We illustrate the utility of the asymptotic solution procedure
by demonstrating that it can be used to predict the Kapitza resistance (and
temperature jump) associated with an interface between two materials.

in the ~10x~20arcmin area centered on 03:29:06, +31:19:30 (J2000). Out of 701
light curves in either channel, we find 78 variables over the YSOVAR campaign.
About half of the members are variable. The variable fraction for the most
embedded SEDs (Class I, flat) is higher than that for less embedded SEDs (Class
II), which is in turn higher than the star-like SEDs (Class III). A few objects
have amplitudes (10-90th percentile brightness) in [3.6] or [4.5]>0.2 mag; a
more typical amplitude is 0.1-0.15 mag. The largest color change is >0.2 mag.
There are 24 periodic objects, with 40% of them being flat SED class. This may
mean that the periodic signal is primarily from the disk, not the photosphere,
in those cases. We find 9 variables likely to be 'dippers', where texture in
the disk occults the central star, and 11 likely to be 'bursters', where
accretion instabilities create brightness bursts. There are 39 objects that
have significant trends in [3.6]-[4.5] color over the campaign, about evenly
divided between redder-when-fainter (consistent with extinction variations) and
bluer-when-fainter. About a third of the 17 Class 0 and/or jet-driving sources
from the literature are variable over the YSOVAR campaign, and a larger
fraction (~half) are variable between the YSOVAR campaign and the cryogenic-era
Spitzer observations (6-7 years), perhaps because it takes time for the
envelope to respond to changes in the central source. The NGC 1333 brown dwarfs
do not stand out from the stellar light curves in any way except there is a
much larger fraction of periodic objects (~60% of variable brown dwarfs are

mechanical resonators. We prove existence of various optimizers and provide an
example when different structures generate the same optimal
quasi-(normal-)eigenvalue. To show that quasi-eigenvalues locally optimal in
various senses are in the spectrum $\Sigma^{nl}$ of the bang-bang eigenproblem
$y"" = - \omega^2 y [ b_1 + (b_2 - b_1) \chi_{\mathbb{C}_+} (y^2 ) ]$, where
$\chi_{\mathbb{C}_+} (\cdot)$ is the indicator function of the upper complex

nonlinear spectrum $\Sigma^{nl}$ in terms of quasi-eigenvalue perturbations. To
address the minimization of the decay rate $| \mathrm{Im} \ \omega |$, we study
the bang-bang equation and explain how it excludes an unknown optimal $B$ from
the optimization process. Computing one of minimal decay structures for 1-side
open settings, we show that it resembles gradually size-modulated 1-D stack

to three non-equilibrium baths. Built on the concept of quantum heat engine,
our three-level model describes non-equilibrium quantum processes including
light-harvesting energy transfer, nano-scale heat transfer, photo-induced
isomerization, and photovoltaics in double quantum-dots. In the context of
light-harvesting, the excitation energy is first pumped up by sunlight, then is
transferred via two excited states which are coupled to a phonon bath, and
finally decays to the ground state. The efficiency of this process is evaluated
by steady state analysis via a polaron-transformed master equation; thus a wide
range of the system-phonon coupling strength can be covered. We show that the
coupling with the phonon bath not only modifies the steady state, resulting in
population inversion, but also introduces a finite steady state coherence which
optimizes the energy transfer flux and efficiency. In the strong coupling
limit, the steady state coherence disappears and the efficiency approaches the
heat engine limit given by Scovil and Schultz-Dubois in Phys. Rew. Lett. 2, 262

features a linear convex part and a nonlinear concave part, and thus by using a
convex-concave time splitting scheme, one can naturally build unconditionally
stable semi-implicit numerical discretizations with linear implicit parts,
which is much easier to implement than conventional models requiring nonlinear
implicit parts. Despite this fundamental difference in the model, numerical

wave anomaly where the signal exhibits low-frequency, high intensity, and

Collective behaviour in a many-body system is thought to be the source for
generating the anomaly, however the detailed mechanism is not fully understood.
Here I show that the physical mechanism is associated with low-frequency
resonance (LFR) in strong small-scale heterogeneity through seismic wave field
modeling for bubble cloud heterogeneity and 1D heterogeneity. LFR is a kind of
wave coherent scattering enhancement or emergence phenomenon that occurs in
transient regime. Its resonance frequency decreases with increasing
heterogeneous scale, impedance contrast, or random heterogeneous scale and
velocity fluctuations; its intensity diminishes with decreasing impedance
contrast or increasing random heterogeneous scale and velocity fluctuations.
LRF exhibits the characteristics of localized wave in space and the shape of
ocean wave in time and is a ubiquitous wave phenomenon in wave physics. The
concept of LFR can open up new opportunities in many aspects of science and
engineering.

characterization of the linear rank-width of distance-hereditary graphs, from
which we derived an algorithm to compute it in polynomial time. In this paper,
we investigate structural properties of distance-hereditary graphs based on
this characterization.
  First, we prove that for a fixed tree $T$, every distance-hereditary graph of
sufficiently large linear rank-width contains a vertex-minor isomorphic to $T$.
We extend this property to bigger graph classes, namely, classes of graphs
whose prime induced subgraphs have bounded linear rank-width. Here, prime
graphs are graphs containing no splits. We conjecture that for every tree $T$,
every graph of sufficiently large linear rank-width contains a vertex-minor
isomorphic to $T$. Our result implies that it is sufficient to prove this
conjecture for prime graphs.
  For a class $\Phi$ of graphs closed under taking vertex-minors, a graph $G$
is called a vertex-minor obstruction for $\Phi$ if $G\notin \Phi$ but all of
its proper vertex-minors are contained in $\Phi$. Secondly, we provide, for
each $k\ge 2$, a set of distance-hereditary graphs that contains all
distance-hereditary vertex-minor obstructions for graphs of linear rank-width
at most $k$. Also, we give a simpler way to obtain the known vertex-minor
obstructions for graphs of linear rank-width at most $1$.

Cr- and V-doped three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) at temperatures
below 100 mK. In those materials, the spins of unfilled d-electrons in the
transition metal dopants are exchange coupled to develop a long-range
ferromagnetic order, which is essential for realizing QAHE. However, the
addition of random dopants does not only introduce excess charge carriers that
require readjusting the Bi/Sb ratio, but also unavoidably introduces
paramagnetic spins that can adversely affect the chiral edge transport in QAHE.
In this work, we show a heterostructure approach to independently tune the
electronic and magnetic properties of the topological surface states in
(BixSb1-x)2Te3 without resorting to random doping of transition metal elements.
In heterostructures consisting of a thin (BixSb1-x)2Te3 TI film and yttrium
iron garnet (YIG), a high Curie temperature (~ 550 K) magnetic insulator, we
find that the TI surface in contact with YIG becomes ferromagnetic via
proximity coupling which is revealed by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). The
Curie temperature of the magnetized TI surface ranges from 20 to 150 K but is
uncorrelated with the Bi fraction x in (BixSb1-x)2Te3. In contrast, as x is
varied, the AHE resistivity scales with the longitudinal resistivity. In this
approach, we decouple the electronic properties from the induced ferromagnetism
in TI. The independent optimization provides a pathway for realizing QAHE at
higher temperatures, which is important for novel spintronic device
applications.

maximal coherence between columns of a $n\times p$ random matrix based on a
sequence of matrix observations having a single unknown change point. The
random matrix is assumed to have identically distributed rows and the maximal
coherence is defined as the largest of the $p \choose 2$ correlation
coefficients associated with any row. Likewise, the $k$ nearest neighbor (kNN)
coherence is defined as the $k$-th largest of these correlation coefficients.
The forms of the pre- and post-change distributions of the observed matrices
are assumed to belong to the family of elliptically contoured densities with
sparse dispersion matrices but are otherwise unknown. A non-parametric stopping
rule is proposed that is based on the maximal k-nearest neighbor sample
coherence between columns of each observed random matrix. This is a summary
statistic that is related to a test of the existence of a hub vertex in a
sample correlation graph having a degree at least $k$. Performance bounds on
the delay and false alarm performance of the proposed stopping rule are
obtained in the purely high dimensional regime where $p\rightarrow \infty$ and
$n$ is fixed. When the pre-change dispersion matrix is diagonal it is shown
that, among all functions of the proposed summary statistic, the proposed
stopping rule is asymptotically optimal under a minimax quickest change
detection (QCD) model as the stopping threshold approaches infinity. The theory
developed also applies to sequential hypothesis testing and fixed sample size
tests.

is isomorphic to the subgraph of $G$ induced by each set $V_i$ for $i =
1,2,\dots,n.$ The pattern graph $H$ is fixed.
  For the parametrization we consider three distinct structural parameters of
the graph $G$ - namely the tree-width, the neighborhood diversity, and the
modular-width. For the parametrization by the neighborhood diversity we obtain
an FPT algorithm for every graph $H.$ For the parametrization by the tree-width
we obtain an FPT algorithm for every connected graph $H.$ Finally, for the
parametrization by the modular-width we derive an FPT algorithm for every prime
graph $H.$

workflows in which the simulation state is saved at prescribed frequencies for
post-processing analysis. While the need to shift to in~situ workflows has been
acknowledged for some time, much of the current research is focused on static
workflows, where the analysis that would have been done as a post-process is
performed concurrently with the simulation at user-prescribed frequencies.
Recently, research efforts are striving to enable adaptive workflows, in which
the frequency, composition, and execution of computational and data
manipulation steps dynamically depend on the state of the simulation. Adapting
the workflow to the state of simulation in such a data-driven fashion puts
extremely strict efficiency requirements on the analysis capabilities that are
used to identify the transitions in the workflow. In this paper we build upon
earlier work on trigger detection using sublinear techniques to drive adaptive
workflows. Here we propose a methodology to detect the time when sudden heat
release occurs in simulations of turbulent combustion. Our proposed method
provides an alternative metric that can be used along with our former metric to
increase the robustness of trigger detection. We show the effectiveness of our
metric empirically for predicting heat release for two use cases.

realized in the laboratory, made of two independent qubits and a random
classical field locally interacting with one qubit alone. We study the
dynamical relationship between the two-qubit entanglement and the genuine
tripartite correlations of the overall system, finding that collapse and
revivals of entanglement correspond, respectively, to raise and fall of the
overall tripartite correlations. Interestingly, entanglement dark periods can
enable plateaux of nonzero tripartite correlations. We then explain this
behavior in terms of information flows among the different parties of the
system. Besides showcasing the phenomenon of the freezing of overall
correlations, our results provide new insights on the origin of retrieval of
entanglement within a hybrid quantum-classical system.

exist but are too large to be applicable in practice. We try to answer the

there is a significant gap between them. In doing so, we present the software
library marathon which is designed to support the analysis of MCMC based

properties of so-called state graphs which represent the structure of Markov
chains. We use marathon to investigate the quality of several bounding methods

graph realizations. In a set of experiments, we compute the total mixing time
and several of its bounds for a large number of input instances. We find that
the upper bound gained by the famous canonical path method is several
magnitudes larger than the total mixing time and deteriorates with growing

dominate the dissipative dynamics? The answer has profound consequences for the
long-time quantum correlations within the system. We consider two bosonic modes
coupled to a bath. By comparing an exact solution to different Markovian master
equations, we find that a smooth crossover of the equations-of-motion between
dominant inter-system and system-bath coupling exists -- but requires a
non-secular master equation. We predict a singular behaviour of the dynamics,
and show that the ultimate failure of non-secular equations of motion is
essentially a failure of the Markov approximation. Our findings justify the use

shown to possess infinitely degenerate disordered hyperuniform classical ground
states with novel physical properties. Previous attempts to sample the
infinitely degenerate ground states used energy minimization techniques,
introducing algorithmic dependence that is artificial in nature. Recently, an
ensemble theory of stealthy hyperuniform ground states was formulated to
predict the structure and thermodynamics that was shown to be in excellent
agreement with corresponding computer simulation results in the canonical
ensemble (in the zero-temperature limit). In this paper, we provide details and
justifications of the simulation procedure, which involves performing molecular
dynamics simulations at sufficiently low temperatures and minimizing the energy
of the snapshots for both the high-density disordered regime, where the theory
applies, as well as lower densities. We also use numerical simulations to
extend our study to the lower-density regime. We report results for the pair
correlation functions, structure factors, and Voronoi cell statistics. In the
high-density regime, we verify the theoretical ansatz that stealthy disordered
ground states behave like ""pseudo"" disordered equilibrium hard-sphere systems
in Fourier space. These results show that as the density decreases from the
high-density limit, the disordered ground states in the canonical ensemble are
characterized by an increasing degree of short-range order and eventually the
system undergoes a phase transition to crystalline ground states. We also
provide numerical evidence suggesting that different forms of stealthy pair
potentials produce the same ground-state ensemble in the zero-temperature
limit. Our techniques may be applied to sample this limit of the canonical
ensemble of other potentials with highly degenerate ground states.

radiation passes by a cloud not taking part in formation of an absorption-line
system in the QSO spectrum. That leads to modification of observable absorption
line profiles and consequently to a bias in physical parameters derived from
standard absorption line analysis. In application to the H$_2$ {absorption}
systems the effect has been revealed in the analysis of H$_2$ absorption system
in the spectrum of Q~1232+082 (Ivanchik et al. 2010, Balashev et al. 2011). We
estimate a probability of the effect to be detected in QSO spectra. To do this
we derive distribution of BLR sizes of high-z QSOs from Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) catalogue and assume different distributions
of cloud sizes. We conclude that the low limit of the probability is about
$11\%$. The latest researches shows that about a fifth of observed H$_2$

to revise significantly physical parameters of interstellar clouds obtained by
the spectral analysis.

anywhere from one to four starspots. The measured properties of identical
starspots identified in both the model and reconstructed images are within two
$\sigma$ error bars in 51$\%$ of cases. The cadence in the data for the 2010

consistent with the photometrically determined period of 54.8 days. In

propose a (rigorous) polynomial-time (classical) algorithm that outputs a

that the effect of any local perturbation (e.g., injecting conserved charges)

non-optimal version of this algorithm efficiently simulates the quantum phase

community detection in complex networks. Firstly, we present a method to
transform a set of time series into a network using different distance
functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most
similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to
identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and,
consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a
comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series
distance functions, network generation methods and community detection
techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed
network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or
up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm
that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such
as $k$-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data
sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns
presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying
network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other
techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is
robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time
shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed
method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to
topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only
for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.

(~20 Msun/yr). Combining high-resolution (Keck-OSIRIS) and large-radius

these targets have about three times less stellar angular momentum than typical
local spiral galaxies of equal stellar mass and bulge fraction. Theoretical
considerations show that this deficiency in angular momentum is the main cause
of their low stability, while the high gas fraction plays a complementary role.
Interestingly, the low jstar values of our targets are similar to those
expected in the M*-population at higher z from the approximate theoretical
scaling jstar~(1+z)^(-1/2) at fixed Mstar. This suggests that a change in

indices, $n$, of galaxies across the SFR-M$_{\star}$ plane. We use a
mass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at $0.5<z<2.5$ selected from the 3D-HST
photometric catalogs. Galaxy light profiles parameterized by $n$ are based on
Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS near-infrared imaging. We use a single SFR
indicator empirically-calibrated from stacks of Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m imaging,
adding the unobscured and obscured star formation. We find that the scatter of
the star-formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatter
due to variations in $n$ at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from
0.14$\pm$0.02 dex at $z\sim2$ to 0.30$\pm$0.04 dex at $z<1$. While the slope of
the log(SFR)-log(M$_{\star}$) relation is of order unity for disk-like
galaxies, galaxies with $n>2$ (implying more dominant bulges) have
significantly lower SFR/M$_{\star}$ than the main ridgeline of the
star-formation sequence. These results suggest that bulges in massive $z\sim2$
galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentration
are relatively young. At $z<1$, the presence of older bulges within
star-forming galaxies lowers global SFR/M$_{\star}$, decreasing the slope and
contributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.

the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) pre-explosion observations of a sample of
27 nearby Type IIb SNe to look for such precursors during the final years prior
to the SN explosion. No precursors are found when combining the observations in
15-day bins, and we calculate the absolute-magnitude-dependent upper limit on

$<0.86$ precursors as bright as absolute $R$-band magnitude $-14$ in the final
3.5 years before the explosion and $<0.56$ events over the final year. In
contrast, precursors among SNe IIn have a $\gtrsim 5$ times higher rate. The
kinetic energy required to unbind a low-mass stellar envelope is comparable to
the radiated energy of a few-weeks-long precursor which would be detectable for
the closest SNe in our sample. Therefore, mass ejections, if they are common in
such SNe, are radiatively inefficient or have durations longer than months.
Indeed, when using 60-day bins a faint precursor candidate is detected prior to
SN 2012cs ($\sim2$% false-alarm probability). We also report the detection of
the progenitor of SN 2011dh which does not show detectable variability over the

Using the recently developed continuous matrix product states techniques, we

governs the ground state, in a similar way as in the Lieb-Liniger model.
However, at strong coupling quasi-crystal and super-Tonks-Girardeau regimes are
also found, which are not present in the original Lieb-Liniger case. Therefore
the presence of the exponentially-decaying potential leads to a
superfluid/super-Tonks-Girardeau/quasi-crystal crossover, when tuning the

Luttinger liquid parameter in the range $K \in (0, \infty)$; in contrast with

for paired electrons in ""incipient"" bands that are close to, but do not cross
the Fermi level. Related theoretical works disagree on whether or not
strong-coupling superconductivity is required to explain such effects, and
whether a critical interaction strength exists. In this work, we consider
various versions of the model problem of pairing of electrons in the presence
of an incipient band, within a simple multiband weak-coupling BCS
approximation. We categorize the problem into two cases: case(I) where
superconductivity arises from the ""incipient band pairing"" alone, and case(II)
where it is induced on an incipient band by pairing due to Fermi-surface based
interactions. Negative conclusions regarding the importance of incipient bands
have been drawn so far largely based on case(I), but we show explicitly that
models under case(II) are qualitatively different, and can explain the
non-exponential suppression of Tc, as well as robust large gaps on an incipient
band. In the latter situation, large gaps on the incipient band do not require
a critical interaction strength. We also model the interplay between phonon and
spin fluctuation driven superconductivity and describe the bootstrap of
electron-phonon superconductivity by spin fluctuations coupling the incipient
and the regular bands. Finally, we discuss the effect of the dimensionality of
the incipient band on our results. We argue that pairing on incipient bands may
be significant and important in several Fe-based materials, including LiFeAs,
FeSe intercalates and FeSe monolayers on strontium titanate, and indeed may
contribute to high critical temperatures in some cases.

algorithms. However, the overall penalty of a frameshift portion in an

incorporate varying codon substitution scores. The second specificity of the
algorithm is its search space being the set of all possible alignments between
two coding sequences, under the classical definition of an alignment between

The minimum reflection channel is formed by destructive interference of
quasi-normal modes at the front surface of the random medium. While the lowest
reflection eigenvalue increases with gain in most random realizations, the
minimum reflection channel can adjust its modal composition to enhance the
destructive interference and slow down the growth of reflectance with gain.
Some of the random realizations display a further reduction of the minimum
reflectance by adding optical gain. The differential amplification of the modes
can make their destructive interference so effective that it dominates over the
amplitude growth of the modes, causing the reflectance to drop with gain.
Therefore, the interplay between interference and amplification makes it
possible to further minimize light reflection from a strong scattering medium
by introducing optical gain.

For nearly all latitudes on Jupiter the thermal component is large enough to
constrain the deep cloud structure even when upper clouds are present. We find
that Hot Spots, belts, and high latitudes have broader line profiles than do
zones. Radiative transfer models show that Hot Spots in the North and South

concerns the process that terminates the growth of the instability. Parasitic
instabilities of both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing-mode type have been
suggested to play a crucial role in this process, disrupting MRI channel flows
and quenching magnetic field amplification. We perform two-dimensional and
three-dimensional sheering-disc simulations of a differentially rotating
protoneutron star layer in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics with unprecedented
high numerical accuracy, finding that Kelvin-Helmholtz parasitic modes dominate
tearing modes in the regime of large hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds
numbers, as encountered close to the surface of protoneutron stars. They also
determine the maximum magnetic field stress achievable during the exponential
growth of the MRI. Our results are consistent with the theory of parasitic
instabilities based on a local stability analysis. To simulate the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities properly, a very high numerical resolution is
necessary. Using ninth-order spatial reconstruction schemes, we find that at
least eight grid zones per MRI channel are necessary to simulate the growth
phase of the MRI and reach an accuracy of ~10 per cent in the growth rate,

smart lubricants for nano-contacts, tuning their tribological and rheological
properties by charging the sliding interfaces. Following our earlier
theoretical study of charging effects on nanoscale confinement and squeezout of
a model IL, we present here molecular dynamics simulations of the frictional
and lubrication properties of that model under charging conditions.First we
describe the case when two equally charged plates slide while being held
together to a confinement distance of a few molecular layers.The shear sliding
stress is found to rise as the number of IL layers decreases stepwise. However
the shear stress shows, within each given number of layers, only a weak
dependence upon the precise value of the normal load, a result in agreement
with data extracted from recent experiments.We subsequently describe the case
of opposite charging of the sliding plates, and follow the shear stress when
the charging is slowly and adiabatically reversed in the course of time, under
fixed load. Despite the fixed load, the number and structure of the confined IL
layers changes with changing charge, and that in turn drives strong friction
variations. The latter involve first of all charging-induced freezing of the IL
film, followed by a discharging-induced melting, both made possible by the
nanoscale confinement. Another mechanism for charging-induced frictional
changes is a shift of the plane of maximum shear from mid-film to the
plate-film interface, and viceversa. While these occurrences and results
invariably depend upon the parameters of the model IL and upon its specific
interaction with the plates, the present study helps identifying a variety of
possible behavior, obtained under very simple assumptions, while connecting it
to an underlying equilibrium thermodynamics picture.

Especially, we focus on the phenomenology of the dark matter and the baryon

We find that with high-scale supersymmetry breaking the singlino can obtain a
sizable radiative correction to the singlino mass, which opens a window for the
singlet dark matter scenario with resonant annihilation via the exchange of the
Higgs boson. We also propose a new electroweak baryogenesis scenario in the

an observed mass of the Higgs boson, constraints by the electric dipole moments

conclude that the nMSSM with a high-scale supersymmetry breaking is valid and
can be probed by the direct direction of the singlino dark matter.

the width $\Gamma_{\rm tot}$ of the hypothetical resonance, finding it to be in
the range 26 GeV $<\Gamma_{\rm tot}<$ 144 GeV at 95\% C.L. We then point out
that the three overlapping selections $WW$, $WZ$, $ZZ$ reported by ATLAS follow
a joint trivariate Poisson distribution, which opens the possibility of a
thorough likelihood analysis of the event rates. The background systematic
uncertainties are also included in our analysis. We show that the data do not
require $W\!Z$ production and could thus in principle be explained by neutral

Lagrangians of singlet resonances. Regarding specific models, we find that
neither scalars coupled via the Higgs-portal nor the Randall-Sundrum (RS)

by the neutralino contributions, it is found that the discrepancy can be
explained if only the Bino and sleptons are light. This setup is ""minimal"" to

di-photon, which is sensitive to new physics. We also study future prospects of
the stau which contributes to the Higgs coupling. If the stau is heavier than
the smuon, we show that the bound can be as large as 1.4 (1.9) TeV. Such
non-universal slepton mass spectrum generically predicts too large LFV/CPV. We
show that the models are expected to be probed by LHC/ILC and LFV/CPV

velocity is given by a balance between current and dissipation and has an upper

and HI 1.4GHz line emission from an 1 square degree region along the l =
328{\deg} (G328) sightline in the Galactic Plane. Emission arises principally
from gas in three spiral arm crossings along the sight line. The distribution
of the emission in the CO and [CI] lines is found to be similar, with the [CI]
slightly more extended, and both are enveloped in extensive HI. Spectral line
ratios per voxel in the data cubes are found to be similar across the entire
extent of the Galaxy. However, towards the edges of the molecular clouds the
[CI]/13CO and 12CO/13CO line ratios rise by ~50%, and the [CI]/HI ratio falls
by ~10$%. We attribute this to these sightlines passing predominantly through
the surfaces of photodissociation regions (PDRs), where the carbon is found
mainly as C or C+, while the H2 is mostly molecular, and the proportion of
atomic gas also increases. We undertake modelling of the PDR emission from low
density molecular clouds excited by average interstellar radiation fields and
cosmic-ray ionization to quantify this comparison, finding that depletion of
sulfur and reduced PAH abundance is needed to match line fluxes and ratios.
Roughly one-third of the molecular gas along the sightline is found to be
associated with this surface region, where the carbon is largely not to be
found in CO. ~10% of the atomic hydrogen along the sightline is cold gas within
PDRs.

considerably larger in the penumbra and still somewhat larger in the spot's
surroundings. The azimuthally averaged field becomes more horizontal with
radial distance from the center of the spot, but more vertical with height. At
tau=1, the LOS velocity shows an average upflow of 300 ms-1 in the inner
penumbra and an average downflow of 1300 ms-1 in the outer penumbra. The
downflow continues outside the visible penumbral boundary. The sunspot shows a
moderate negative twist of < 5^0 at tau=1, which increases with height. The
sunspot umbra and the spines of the penumbra show considerable similarity in
their physical properties albeit with some quantitative differences. The
temperature shows a general anticorrelation with the field strength, with the
exception of the heads of penumbral filaments, where a weak positive
correlation is found. The dependence of the physical parameters on each other
over the full sunspot shows a qualitative similarity to that of a standard
penumbral filament and its surrounding spines. Our results suggest that the
spines in the penumbra are basically the outward extension of the umbra. The

halo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call Stellar-Halo Accretion Rate
Coevolution (SHARC). We show that the $\sim0.3$ dex dispersion of the halo MAR
matches the observed dispersion of the SFR on the star-formation main sequence
(MS). In the context of ""bathtub""-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads
to mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its
simplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC
model is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with $M_*=10^9-
10^{10.5}M_\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star formation
in the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the
MS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at $z\sim4$, but exceed observations at
$z>4$. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the
""equilibrium condition"" in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation
of net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. With assumptions
about preventive feedback based on simulations, SHARC allows calculation of
galaxy metallicity evolution. If galaxy SFRs indeed track halo MARs, especially
at low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxy
properties to halos (including age-matching) and the similarities between
two-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.

clusters than lower mass BCGs. Furthermore, cDs, which are BCGs with
particularly extended envelopes, seem to prefer marginally denser regions and
tend to be hosted by more massive halos than elliptical BCGs. cD and elliptical
BCGs show parallel positive correlations between their stellar masses and
environmental densities. However, at a fixed environmental density, cDs are, on
average, ~40% more massive. Our results, together with the findings of previous
studies, suggest an evolutionary link between elliptical and cD BCGs. We
suggest that most present-day cDs started their life as ellipticals, which
subsequently grew in stellar mass and size due to mergers. In this process, the
cD envelope developed. The large scatter in the stellar masses and sizes of the
cDs reflects their different merger histories. The growth of the BCGs in mass
and size seems to be linked to the hierarchical growth of the structures they
inhabit: as the groups and clusters became denser and more massive, the BCGs at
their centres also grew. This process is nearing completion since the majority
(~60%) of the BCGs in the local Universe have cD morphology. However, the
presence of galaxies with intermediate morphological classes (between
ellipticals and cDs) suggests that the growth and morphological transformation
of some BCGs is still ongoing.

stronger transverse electron focusing. Both effects reduce the gain length and
the overall undulator length. The peak power and efficiency depend on the
transverse electron beam distribution and on time dependent effects, like
synchrotron sideband growth. The last effect is identified as the main cause
for reduction of electron beam microbunching and FEL peak power. We show that
the optimal functional form for the undulator magnetic field tapering profile,
yielding the maximum output power, depends significantly on these effects. The

(cQED) allows strong dipole coupling between electrons and a high-Q
superconducting microwave resonator, enabling such sensitive detection and
manipulation of electron degrees of freedom. Here we present the first
realization of a hybrid circuit in which a large number of electrons are
trapped on the surface of superfluid helium inside a coplanar waveguide
resonator. The high finesse of the resonator allows us to observe large
dispersive shifts that are many times the linewidth and make fast and sensitive
measurements on the collective vibrational modes of the electron ensemble, as
well as the superfluid helium film underneath. Furthermore, a large ensemble
coupling is observed in the dispersive regime during experiment, and it shows
excellent agreement with our numeric model. The coupling strength of the
ensemble to the cavity is found to be >1 MHz per electron, indicating the
feasibility of achieving single electron strong coupling.

of the hadron-quark crossover picture where a smooth transition from the
hadronic phase to the quark phase takes place at finite baryon density. By
using a phenomenological equation of state (EOS) ""CRover"" which interpolates
the two phases at around 3 times the nuclear matter density, it is found that
the cold NSs with the gravitational mass larger than 2-solarmass can be
sustained. This is in sharp contrast to the case of the first-order
hadron-quark transition. The radii of the cold NSs with the CRover EOS are in
the narrow range which is insensitive to the NS masses. Due to the stiffening
of the EOS induced by the hadron-quark crossover, the central density of the
NSs is at most 4 times the nuclear matter density and the hyperon-mixing barely
occurs inside the NS core. This constitutes a solution of the long-standing
hyperon puzzle. The effect of color superconductivity (CSC) on the NS
structures is also examined with the hadron-quark crossover. For the typical
strength of the diquark attraction, a slight softening of the EOS due to
two-flavor CSC (2SC) takes place and the maximum mass is reduced by about
0.2-solarmass.
  The CRover EOS is generalized to the supernova matter at finite temperature
to describe the hot NSs at birth. The hadron-quark crossover is found to
decrease the central temperature of the hot NSs under isentropic condition. The
gravitational energy release and the spin-up rate during the contraction from
the hot NS to the cold NS are also estimated.

We argue that the key element for developing this ability is repeated practice

demonstrate a structure for providing suitable practice that can be applied in
any instructional setting that involves the acquisition of data and relating
that data to scientific models. This study reports the results of applying that
structure in an introductory physics lab course. Students in an experimental
condition were repeatedly instructed to make and act on quantitative
comparisons between datasets, and between data and models, an approach that is
common to all science disciplines. These instructions were slowly faded across
the course. After the instructions had been removed, students in the
experimental condition were 12 times more likely to spontaneously propose or
make changes to improve their experimental methods than a control group, who
performed traditional experimental activities. They were also four times more
likely to identify and explain a limitation of a physical model using their
data. Students in the experimental condition also showed much more
sophisticated reasoning about their data. These differences between the groups

excitation spectra above the chemical potential for the unoccupied states has
attracted many research attentions. There were many theoretical works using
different numerical techniques to study this problem, but many have reached
different conclusions. One of the reasons is the lack of very detailed
high-resolution experimental results for the theories to be compared with.
Recently, the scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS)\cite{cai2015visualizing,ye2013visualizing} on lightly doped Mott
insulator with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order found the presence of in-gap
states with energy of order half an eV above the chemical potential. The
measured spectral properties with doping are not quite consistent with earlier
theoretical works. In this paper we perform a diagonalization method on top of
the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculation to study the evolution of AFM
Mott state with doped hole concentration in the Hubbard model (HM). Our results
found in-gap states that behave similarly with ones reported by STS. These
in-gap states acquire a substantial amount of dynamical spectral weight
transferred from the upper Hubbard band. The in-gap states move toward chemical
potential with increasing spectral weight as doping increases. Our result also
provides information about the energy scale of these in-gap states in relation
with the coulomb coupling strength U.

(PISAA) algorithm, a stochastic simulation procedure for global optimisation,
that extends and improves the stochastic approximation annealing (SAA) by using
population Monte Carlo ideas. The standard SAA algorithm guarantees convergence
to the global minimum when a square-root cooling schedule is used; however the
efficiency of its performance depends crucially on its self-adjusting
mechanism. Because its mechanism is based on information obtained from only a
single chain, SAA may present slow convergence in complex optimisation
problems. The proposed algorithm involves simulating a population of SAA chains
that interact each other in a manner that ensures significant improvement of
the self-adjusting mechanism and better exploration of the sampling space.
Central to the proposed algorithm are the ideas of (i) recycling information
from the whole population of Markov chains to design a more accurate/stable
self-adjusting mechanism and (ii) incorporating more advanced proposals, such
as crossover operations, for the exploration of the sampling space. PISAA
presents a significantly improved performance in terms of convergence. PISAA
can be implemented in parallel computing environments if available. We
demonstrate the good performance of the proposed algorithm on challenging
applications including Bayesian network learning and protein folding. Our
numerical comparisons suggest that PISAA outperforms the simulated annealing,

demonstrate a multiple-stable memory device in epitaxial manganese telluride

semiconductors. Favorable micromagnetic characteristics of MnTe allow us to
demonstrate a smoothly varying antiferromagnetic anisotropic magnetoresistance
(AMR) with a harmonic angular dependence on the applied magnetic field,
analogous to ferromagnets. The continuously varying AMR provides means for the
electrical read-out of multiple-stable antiferromagnetic memory states which we
set by heat-assisted magneto-recording and by changing the angle of the writing
field. We explore the dependence of the magnitude of the zero-field read-out
signal on the strength of the writing field and demonstrate the robustness of
the antiferromagnetic memory states against strong magnetic field
perturbations. We ascribe the multiple-stability in our antiferromagnetic
memory to different distributions of domains with the N\'eel vector aligned
along one of the three $c$-plane magnetic easy axes in the hexagonal MnTe film.
The domain redistribution is controlled during the heat-assisted recording by
the strength and angle of the writing field and freezes when sufficiently below
the N\'eel temperature.

to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. In general, a physical
generator contains two parts---a randomness source and its readout. The source
is essential to the quality of the resulting random numbers; hence, it needs to
be carefully calibrated and modeled to achieve information-theoretical provable
randomness. However, in practice, the source is a complicated physical system,
such as a light source or an atomic ensemble, and any deviations in the
real-life implementation from the theoretical model may affect the randomness
of the output. To close this gap, we propose a source-independent scheme for
quantum random number generation in which output randomness can be certified,
even when the source is uncharacterized and untrusted. In our randomness
analysis, we make no assumptions about the dimension of the source. For
instance, multiphoton emissions are allowed in optical implementations. Our
analysis takes into account the finite-key effect with the composable security
definition. In the limit of large data size, the length of the input random
seed is exponentially small compared to that of the output random bit. In
addition, by modifying a quantum key distribution system, we experimentally

anomalous behavior, often referred to as anomaly detection. Similarity-based
anomaly detection algorithms detect abnormally large amounts of similarity or
dissimilarity, e.g.~as measured by nearest neighbor Euclidean distances between
a test sample and the training samples. In many application domains there may
not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous
patterns. In such cases, multiple dissimilarity measures can be defined,
including non-metric measures, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing
using a non-negative linear combination of them. If the relative importance of
the different dissimilarity measures are not known in advance, as in many
anomaly detection applications, the anomaly detection algorithm may need to be
executed multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear
combination. In this paper, we propose a method for similarity-based anomaly
detection using a novel multi-criteria dissimilarity measure, the Pareto depth.
The proposed Pareto depth analysis (PDA) anomaly detection algorithm uses the
concept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria
without having to run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of
weights. The proposed PDA approach is provably better than using linear
combinations of the criteria and shows superior performance on experiments with
synthetic and real data sets.

observations from the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope of the H{\alpha} line, the Ca

observations of the coronal 19.3 nm line. To understand the observed Mg II

experiments. The single-peaked or flat-topped Mg II k profiles found in plage
imply a transition region at a high column mass and a hot and dense
chromosphere of about 6500 K. This scenario is supported by the observed
large-scale correlation between moss brightness and filled-in profiles with
very little or absent self-reversal. The large wing width found in plage also
implies a hot and dense chromosphere with a steep chromospheric temperature
rise. The absence of emission in the Mg II subordinate lines constrain the
chromospheric temperature and the height of the temperature rise while the
width of the O I 135.6 nm line sets a limit to the non-thermal velocities to
around 7 km/s.

are based on the length gauge formulation of the laser-matter coupling. From
the theoretical viewpoint it is known there exists no preferable gauge and
consequently the predictions and outcomes should be independent of this choice.
The use of the length gauge is mainly due to the fact that the quantity
obtained from finite elements simulations of plasmonic fields is the plasmonic
enhanced laser electric field rather than the laser vector potential. In this
paper we develop, from first principles, the velocity gauge formulation of the
problem and we apply it to the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in atoms. A
comparison to the results obtained with the length gauge is made. It is
analytically and numerically demonstrated that both gauges give equivalent
descriptions of the emitted HHG spectra resulting from the interaction of a
spatially inhomogeneous field and the single active electron (SAE) model of the
helium atom. We discuss, however, advantages and disadvantages of using
different gauges in terms of numerical efficiency.

  Ultrasound Imaging",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the key steps in ultrasound image formation is digital beamforming of
signals sampled by several transducer elements placed upon an array.
High-resolution digital beamforming introduces the demand for sampling rates
significantly higher than the signals' Nyquist rate, which greatly increases
the volume of data that must be transmitted from the system's front end. In 3D
ultrasound imaging, 2D transducer arrays rather than 1D arrays are used, and
more scan-lines are needed. This implies that the amount of sampled data is
vastly increased with respect to 2D imaging. In this work we show that a
considerable reduction in data rate can be achieved by applying the ideas of
Xampling and frequency domain beamforming, leading to a sub-Nyquist sampling
rate, which uses only a portion of the bandwidth of the ultrasound signals to
reconstruct the image. We extend previous work on frequency domain beamforming
for 2D ultrasound imaging to accommodate the geometry imposed by volumetric
scanning and a 2D grid of transducer elements. We demonstrate high image
quality from low-rate samples by simulation of a phantom image comprised of
several small reflectors. We also apply our technique on raw data of a heart
ventricle phantom obtained by a commercial 3D ultrasound system. We show that
by performing 3D beamforming in the frequency domain, sub-Nyquist sampling and
low processing rate are achievable, while maintaining adequate image quality.

binaries V40 and V41 in the globular cluster NGC 6362 to derive masses, radii,
and luminosities of the component stars. The orbital periods of these systems
are 5.30 and 17.89 d, respectively. The measured masses of the primary and
secondary components ($M_p$, $M_s$) are (0.8337$\pm$0.0063, 0.7947$\pm$0.0048)
M$_\odot$ for V40 and (0.8215$\pm$0.0058, 0.7280$\pm$0.0047) M$_\odot$ for V41.
The measured radii ($R_p$, $R_s$) are (1.3253$\pm$0.0075, 0.997$\pm$0.013)
R$_\odot$ for V40 and (1.0739$\pm$0.0048, 0.7307$\pm$0.0046) R$_\odot$ for V41.
Based on the derived luminosities, we find that the distance modulus of the
cluster is 14.74$\pm$0.04 mag -- in good agreement with 14.72 mag obtained from
CMD fitting. We compare the absolute parameters of component stars with
theoretical isochrones in mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams. For assumed
abundances [Fe/H] = -1.07, [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.4, and Y = 0.25 we find the most
probable age of V40 to be 11.7$\pm$0.2 Gyr, compatible with the age of the
cluster derived from CMD fitting (12.5$\pm$0.5 Gyr). V41 seems to be markedly
younger than V40. If independently confirmed, this result will suggest that V41
belongs to the younger of the two stellar populations recently discovered in
NGC 6362. The orbits of both systems are eccentric. Given the orbital period
and age of V40, its orbit should have been tidally circularized some $\sim$7
Gyr ago. The observed eccentricity is most likely the result of a relatively
recent close stellar encounter.

This is not a distinctive feature of this class, since it is observed in many

followed by a diffusion process. Possible evidence has recently been reported
by Tello et al. (2012) for a Galactic contamination in the sample of FRED GRBs
discovered with Swift. We searched for possible Galactic intruders disguised as
FRED GRBs in the Swift catalogue up to September 2014. We selected 181 FRED
GRBs (2/3 with unknown redshift) and considered different subsamples. We tested
the degree of isotropy through the dipole and the quadrupole moment
distributions, both with reference to the Galaxy and in a
coordinate-system-independent way, as well as with the two-point angular
autocovariance function. In addition, we searched for possible indicators of a
Galactic origin among the spectral and temporal properties of individual GRBs.
We found marginal (~3 sigma) evidence for an excess of FREDs with unknown
redshift towards the Galactic plane compared with what is expected for an
isotropic distribution corrected for the non-uniform sky exposure. However,
when we account for the observational bias against optical follow-up
observations of low-Galactic latitude GRBs, the evidence for anisotropy
decreases to ~2 sigma. In addition, we found no statistical evidence for
different spectral or temporal properties from the bulk of cosmological GRBs.
We found marginal evidence for the presence of a disguised Galactic population
among Swift GRBs with unknown redshift. The estimated fraction is f=(19 +-
11)%, with an upper limit of 34% (90% confidence).

The galaxies are divided into three luminosity classes and several
distance/redshift bins. First, the 2D CF is determined for each luminosity
class and distance bin. Calculations are based on the quantitative differences
between the surface distributions of galaxy pairs with comparable and
distinctly different photometric redshifts. The power law approximation for the
CF is used. A limited accuracy of photometric redshifts as compared to the
spectroscopic ones has been examined and taken into account. Then, the 3D
functions for all the selected luminosities and distances are calculated. The
power-law parameters of the CF, the slope and the correlation length, are
determined. Both parameters do not show strong variations over the whole
investigated redshift range. The slope of the luminous galaxies appears to be
consistently steeper than that for the fainter ones. The linear bias factor,
b(z), grows systematically with redshift; assuming the local normalization b(0)

instrument detected GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from five novae. The GeV emission
can be interpreted in terms of an inverse Compton process of electrons
accelerated in a shock. In this case it is expected that protons in the same
conditions can be accelerated to much higher energies. Consequently they may
produce a second component in the {\gamma}-ray spectrum at TeV energies. Aims.
We aim to explore the very-high-energy domain to search for {\gamma}-ray
emission above 50 GeV and to shed light on the acceleration process of leptons
and hadrons in nova explosions. Methods. We have performed observations with
the MAGIC telescopes of the classical nova V339 Del shortly after the 2013
outburst, triggered by optical and subsequent GeV {\gamma}-ray detec- tions. We
also briefly report on VHE observations of the symbiotic nova YY Her and the
dwarf nova ASASSN-13ax. We complement the TeV MAGIC observations with the
analysis of con- temporaneous Fermi-LAT data of the sources. The TeV and GeV
observations are compared in order to evaluate the acceleration parameters for
leptons and hadrons. Results. No significant TeV emission was found from the
studied sources. We computed upper limits on the spectrum and night-by-night
flux. The combined GeV and TeV observations of V339 Del limit the ratio of
proton to electron luminosities to Lp<~0.15 Le.

  Engines",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fault-tolerance techniques for stream processing engines can be categorized
into passive and active approaches. A typical passive approach periodically
checkpoints a processing task's runtime states and can recover a failed task by
restoring its runtime state using its latest checkpoint. On the other hand, an
active approach usually employs backup nodes to run replicated tasks. Upon
failure, the active replica can take over the processing of the failed task
with minimal latency. However, both approaches have their own inadequacies in
Massively Parallel Stream Processing Engines (MPSPE). The passive approach
incurs a long recovery latency especially when a number of correlated nodes
fail simultaneously, while the active approach requires extra replication
resources. In this paper, we propose a new fault-tolerance framework, which is
Passive and Partially Active (PPA). In a PPA scheme, the passive approach is
applied to all tasks while only a selected set of tasks will be actively
replicated. The number of actively replicated tasks depends on the available
resources. If tasks without active replicas fail, tentative outputs will be
generated before the completion of the recovery process. We also propose
effective and efficient algorithms to optimize a partially active replication
plan to maximize the quality of tentative outputs. We implemented PPA on top of
Storm, an open-source MPSPE and conducted extensive experiments using both real
and synthetic datasets to verify the effectiveness of our approach.

cavities with a frequency below a given limit known as the cut-off frequency.
At higher frequencies, waves are no longer trapped in the stellar interior and
become traveller waves. In this article we study six pulsating solar-like stars
at different evolutionary stages observed by the NASA Kepler mission. These
high signal-to-noise targets show a peak structure that extends at very high
frequencies and are good candidates for studying the transition region between
the modes and the interference peaks or pseudo-modes. Following the same

existence of pseudo-modes in these stars with one or two dominant interference
patterns depending on the evolutionary stage of the star. We also infer their
cut-off frequency as the midpoint between the last eigenmode and the first peak
of the interference patterns. By using ray theory we show that, while the
period of one of the interference pattern is very close to half the large
separation the other, one depends on the time phase of mixed waves, thus
carrying additional information on the stellar structure and evolution.

  In the present paper, a detailed description of the STARWALL code is given
and some of its applications are presented to demonstrate the methods used.
Conducting structures are treated in the thin wall approximation and depending
on their complexity they are discretized by a spectral method or by triangular
finite elements. As an example, a configuration is considered consisting of an
ideal plasma surrounded by a vacuum domain containing a resistive wall and
bounded by an external wall. Ideal linear MHD modes and resistive wall modes in
the presence of multiply-connected walls are studied. In order to treat the
vertical mode self-consistently the STARWALL code has been completed by adding
the so-called Luest-Martensen term generated by a constant normal displacement
of the plasma.

  of Data Streams",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stream mining poses unique challenges to machine learning: predictive models
are required to be scalable, incrementally trainable, must remain bounded in
size (even when the data stream is arbitrarily long), and be nonparametric in
order to achieve high accuracy even in complex and dynamic environments.
Moreover, the learning system must be parameterless ---traditional tuning
methods are problematic in streaming settings--- and avoid requiring prior
knowledge of the number of distinct class labels occurring in the stream. In
this paper, we introduce a new algorithmic approach for nonparametric learning
in data streams. Our approach addresses all above mentioned challenges by
learning a model that covers the input space using simple local classifiers.
The distribution of these classifiers dynamically adapts to the local (unknown)
complexity of the classification problem, thus achieving a good balance between
model complexity and predictive accuracy. We design four variants of our
approach of increasing adaptivity. By means of an extensive empirical
evaluation against standard nonparametric baselines, we show state-of-the-art
results in terms of accuracy versus model size. For the variant that imposes a
strict bound on the model size, we show better performance against all other
methods measured at the same model size value. Our empirical analysis is
complemented by a theoretical performance guarantee which does not rely on any
stochastic assumption on the source generating the stream.

each node possesses little or non-existing information on the network topology.
In particular, this paper assumes that each node only knows its unique
identifier. The aim is to estimate the cardinality of the graph and the
neighbours of each node by querying a small portion of them. While the former
allows the design of more efficient coding schemes for the network, the second
provides a reliable way for routing packets. As a reference for comparison,
this work considers the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). For dense
graphs and specific running times, the proposed algorithm produces a
cardinality estimate proportional to the BLUE. Furthermore, for an arbitrary
number of iterations, the estimate converges to the BLUE as the number of
queried nodes tends to the total number of nodes in the network. Simulation
results confirm the theoretical results by revealing that, for a moderate
running time, asking a small group of nodes is sufficient to perform an
estimation of 95% of the whole network.

is, ""Is it possible to get quantum advantages without any modification of the
classical game?"" The answer to this question so far has largely been negative.
So far, it has usually been thought that a change of the classical game setting
appears to be unavoidable for getting the quantum advantages. However, we give
an affirmative answer here, focusing on the decision-making process (we call
'reasoning') to generate the best strategy, which may occur internally, e.g.,
in the player's brain. To show this, we consider a classical guessing game. We
then define a one-player reasoning problem in the context of the
decision-making theory, where the machinery processes are designed to simulate
classical and quantum reasoning. In such settings, we present a scenario where
a rational player is able to make better use of his/her weak preferences due to
quantum reasoning, without any altering or resetting of the classically defined
game. We also argue in further analysis that the quantum reasoning may make the
player fail, and even make the situation worse, due to any inappropriate
preferences.

Measurement Vectors (MMVs) have been recently carried. These studies assume the
vectors of the different channels to be jointly sparse. In this paper, we relax
this condition. Instead we assume that these sparse vectors depend on each
other but that this dependency is unknown. We capture this dependency by
computing the conditional probability of each entry in each vector being
non-zero, given the ""residuals"" of all previous vectors. To estimate these
probabilities, we propose the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)[1], a
data driven model for sequence modelling that is deep in time. To calculate the
model parameters, we minimize a cross entropy cost function. To reconstruct the
sparse vectors at the decoder, we propose a greedy solver that uses the above
model to estimate the conditional probabilities. By performing extensive
experiments on two real world datasets, we show that the proposed method
significantly outperforms the general MMV solver (the Simultaneous Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (SOMP)) and a number of the model-based Bayesian methods. The
proposed method does not add any complexity to the general compressive sensing
encoder. The trained model is used just at the decoder. As the proposed method
is a data driven method, it is only applicable when training data is available.
In many applications however, training data is indeed available, e.g. in
recorded images and videos.

an observable multidimensional random vector into components that are as
statistically independent as possible from each other.Usually the ICA framework
assumes a model according to which the observations are generated (such as a
linear transformation with additive noise). ICA over finite fields is a special
case of ICA in which both the observations and the independent components are
over a finite alphabet. In this work we consider a generalization of this
framework in which an observation vector is decomposed to its independent
components (as much as possible) with no prior assumption on the way it was
generated. This generalization is also known as Barlow's minimal redundancy
representation problem and is considered an open problem. We propose several
theorems and show that this NP hard problem can be accurately solved with a
branch and bound search tree algorithm, or tightly approximated with a series
of linear problems. Our contribution provides the first efficient and
constructive set of solutions to Barlow's problem.The minimal redundancy
representation (also known as factorial code) has many applications, mainly in
the fields of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The Binary ICA (BICA) is also
shown to have applications in several domains including medical diagnosis,
multi-cluster assignment, network tomography and internet resource management.

has never been established with great accuracy. This even let some authors
argue that it was a statistical artefact. It is true that the data must be
selected and analyzed with great care, especially for age groups of small size
such as widowers under 25. The observations reported in this paper were
selected and designed in the same way as experiments in physics, that is to say
with the objective of minimizing the error bars for all age-groups. It will be
seen that data appropriate for mid-age groups may be unsuitable for young age
groups and vice versa. The investigation led to the following results. (1) The
FB effect is basically the same for men and women, except that on average it is
about 20\% stronger for men. (2) There is a marked difference between single or
divorced persons on the one hand, for whom the effect is largest around the age
of 45, and widowed persons on the other hand, for whom the effect is largest
around the age of 25. (3) When different causes of death are distinguished, the
effect is largest for suicide and smallest for cancer. (4) For young widowers
the death rates are up to 10 times higher than for married persons of same age.
This extreme form of the FB effect will be referred to as the ""young widower

complicated expressions in terms of the AdS scalar field mode functions, which
are in turn related to the Jacobi polynomials. We analyze the behavior of these

for understanding the properties of the finite-time singularity in solutions of
the time-averaged theory recently reported in the literature. We highlight, in

frequencies in higher-dimensional AdS suggests strengthening of turbulent
instabilities in higher dimensions. In the course of our derivations, we arrive
at recursive relations for the coefficients of the time-averaged theory that
are likely to be useful for evaluating them more efficiently in numerical

slower relaxation process during which the death rate decreases as a power law
(with an exponent close to 0.7). This leads us to propose a general principle
which can be summarized as follows: ""ANY abrupt change in living conditions
generates a mortality spike which acts as a kind of selection process."" This we
term the Transient Shock conjecture. It provides a qualitative model which
leads to testable predictions. For example, marriage certainly brings about a
major change in environmental and social conditions and according to our

support low-frequency surface-plasmon modes, which enable strong light
localization and field enhancement. We suggest studying such configurations
using singular perturbation methods, and demonstrate the efficacy of this
approach by considering, in the quasi-static limit, a pair of nearly touching
metallic nano-spheres subjected to an incident electromagnetic wave polarized
with the electric field along the line of sphere centers. Rather than
attempting an exact analytical solution, we construct the pertinent
(longitudinal) eigen-modes by matching relatively simple asymptotic expansions
valid in overlapping spatial domains. We thereby arrive at an effective
boundary eigenvalue problem in a half-space representing the metal region in
the vicinity of the gap. Coupling with the gap field gives rise to a mixed-type
boundary condition with varying coefficients, whereas coupling with the
particle-scale field enters through an integral eigenvalue selection rule
involving the electrostatic capacitance of the configuration. By solving the
reduced problem we obtain accurate closed-form expressions for the resonance
values of the metal dielectric function. Furthermore, together with an
energy-like integral relation, the latter eigen-solutions yield also
closed-form approximations for the induced-dipole moment and gap-field
enhancement under resonance. We demonstrate agreement between the asymptotic
formulas and a semi-numerical computation. The analysis, underpinned by
asymptotic scaling arguments, elucidates how metal polarization together with
geometrical confinement enables a strong plasmon-frequency redshift and
amplified near-field at resonance.

that low-mass planet host stars show higher [Mg/Si] ratios, while giant planet

other clusters at or above this redshift. There is a wealth of ancillary data
available, including Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope optical, UKIRT-K,
Spitzer-IRAC/MIPS, and Herschel-SPIRE. This work adds submillimeter imaging
with the SCUBA2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and near-infrared
imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The mid/far-infrared (M/FIR)
data detect an Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxy spatially coincident with the
central galaxy, with LIR = 6.2+/-0.9 x 10^12 Lsun. The detection of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at z=1.7 in a Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the source
implies the FIR luminosity is dominated by star formation (an Active Galactic
Nucleus contribution of 20%) with a rate of ~860+/-30 Msun/yr. The optical
source corresponding to the IR emission is likely a chain of of > 10 individual
clumps arranged as ""beads on a string"" over a linear scale of 66 kpc. Its
morphology and proximity to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy imply a gas-rich
interaction at the center of the cluster triggered the star formation. This
system indicates that wet mergers may be an important process in forming the
stellar mass of BCGs at early times.

of path-connected spaces having the unit disk as an object, we construct a
category of $\mathcal{C}$-coverings over a given space $X$ that embeds in the
category of $\pi_1(X,x_0)$-sets via the usual monodromy action on fibers. When
$\mathcal{C}$ is extended to its coreflective hull $\mathscr{H}(\mathcal{C})$,
the resulting category of based $\mathscr{H}(\mathcal{C})$-coverings is
complete, has an initial object, and often characterizes more of the subgroup

category of $\Delta$-coverings employs the convenient category of
$\Delta$-generated spaces and is universal in the sense that it contains every
other generalized covering category as a subcategory. (2) In the locally

Such counterintuitive phenomenon is explained by the formation of an effective
linear dispersion in the bilayer bandstructure, which roots in the symmetry

their constituents. For increasing magnetization a classical ferrofluid
undergoes a Rosensweig instability and creates self-organized ordered surface
structures or droplet crystals. A Bose-Einstein condensate with strong dipolar
interactions is a quantum ferrofluid that also shows superfluidity. The field
of dipolar quantum gases is motivated by the search for new phases that break
continuous symmetries. The simultaneous breaking of continuous symmetries like
the phase invariance for the superfluid state and the translational symmetry
for a crystal provides the basis of novel states of matter. However,
interaction-induced crystallization in a superfluid has not been observed. Here
we use in situ imaging to directly observe the spontaneous transition from an
unstructured superfluid to an ordered arrangement of droplets in an atomic
dysprosium Bose-Einstein condensate. By utilizing a Feshbach resonance to
control the interparticle interactions, we induce a finite-wavelength
instability and observe discrete droplets in a triangular structure, growing
with increasing atom number. We find that these states are surprisingly
long-lived and measure a hysteretic behaviour, which is typical for a
crystallization process and in close analogy to the Rosensweig instability. Our
system can show both superfluidity and, as shown here, spontaneous
translational symmetry breaking. The presented observations do not probe
superfluidity in the structured states, but if the droplets establish a common
phase via weak links, this system is a very good candidate for a supersolid
ground state.

The accuracy of a centre-ofmass approach to image shift measurement depends on

exists no analytical prediction for these parameters for extended objects.
Motivated by this we present a new method for exploring the parameter space of
image shift measurement algorithms, and apply this to optimize the parameters

improve centroid accuracy compared to the typical parabolic fitting approach by
a factor of 3 in a signal-to-noise regime typical for solar AO. Exploration of
the parameters occurs after initial image crosscorrelation with a reference

presented employ methods which can be used in real-time to estimate the error
on centroids, allowing the system to use real data to optimize parameters,

applied outside of solar AO to any field which requires the tracking of an

tractable approximations for a subset of these problems using distributive law
in the form of message passing. The quality of the resulting message passing
procedure, called Belief Propagation (BP), depends on the influence of loops in
the graphical model. We contribute to three classes of approximations that
improve BP for loopy graphs A) loop correction techniques; B) survey
propagation, another message passing technique that surpasses BP in some
settings; and C) hybrid methods that interpolate between deterministic message
passing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference.
  We then review the existing message passing solutions and provide novel
graphical models and inference techniques for combinatorial problems under
three broad classes: A) constraint satisfaction problems such as
satisfiability, coloring, packing, set / clique-cover and dominating /
independent set and their optimization counterparts; B) clustering problems
such as hierarchical clustering, K-median, K-clustering, K-center and
modularity optimization; C) problems over permutations including assignment,

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime model. By projecting the UFL along the
Kodama vector the second Friedmann equation can be obtained. Also studying the
UFL on the event horizon it is found that Clausius relation cannot be obtained
from the UFL by projecting it along the tangent to the event horizon as it can
be for the trapping horizon. However, it is shown in the present work that
Clausius relation can be obtained by projecting the UFL along the Kodama vector
on the horizon and the result is found to be true for any horizon. Finally
motivated by the Unruh temperature for the Rindler observer, surface gravity is
redefined and a Clausius relation is obtained from the UFL by projecting it
along a vector analogous to the Kodama vector.

Subang, West Java, Indonesia. The paper discusses and employs the evolutionary
game theoretic insights to see the process of 'gantangan', of the intertwining
social cohesion and economic expectation of the participation within the
traditional activities. The current development of the gantangan tradition is
approached and generalized to propose a view between the economic and social
sphere surrounding modern people. While some explanations due to the current
development of gantangan is drawn, some aspects related to traditional views
complying the modern life with social and economic expectations is outlined.

dispersive evolution equations which approximates the full water wave problem.
The system is an extension of the well known shallow-water system to the
situation where the waves are long, but not so long that dispersive effects can
be neglected.
  In the current work, the focus is on deriving mass, momentum and energy
densities and fluxes associated with the Serre-Green-Naghdi system. These
quantities arise from imposing balance equations of the same asymptotic order
as the evolution equations. In the case of an even bed, the conservation
equations are satisfied exactly by the solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi
system. The case of variable bathymetry is more complicated, with mass and
momentum conservation satisfied exactly, and energy conservation satisfied only
in a global sense. In all cases, the quantities found here reduce correctly to
the corresponding counterparts in both the Boussinesq and the shallow-water
scaling.
  One consequence of the present analysis is that the energy loss appearing in
the shallow-water theory of undular bores is fully compensated by the emergence
of oscillations behind the bore front. The situation is analyzed numerically by
approximating solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations using a
finite-element discretization coupled with an adaptive Runge-Kutta time
integration scheme, and it is found that the energy is indeed conserved nearly
to machine precision. As a second application, the shoaling of solitary waves
on a plane beach is analyzed. It appears that the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations
are capable of predicting both the shape of the free surface and the evolution
of kinetic and potential energy with good accuracy in the early stages of
shoaling.

in the brain is proposed and then explored. Phosphorus is identified as the
unique biological element with a nuclear spin that can serve as a qubit for
such putative quantum processing - a neural qubit - while the phosphate ion is
the only possible qubit-transporter. We identify the ""Posner molecule"",
$\text{Ca}_9 (\text{PO}_4)_6$, as the unique molecule that can protect the
neural qubits on very long times and thereby serve as a (working)
quantum-memory. A central requirement for quantum-processing is quantum
entanglement. It is argued that the enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction which
breaks a pyrophosphate ion into two phosphate ions can quantum entangle pairs
of qubits. Posner molecules, formed by binding such phosphate pairs with
extracellular calcium ions, will inherit the nuclear spin entanglement. A
mechanism for transporting Posner molecules into presynaptic neurons during a
""kiss and run"" exocytosis, which releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic
cleft, is proposed. Quantum measurements can occur when a pair of Posner
molecules chemically bind and subsequently melt, releasing a shower of
intra-cellular calcium ions that can trigger further neurotransmitter release
and enhance the probability of post-synaptic neuron firing. Multiple entangled
Posner molecules, triggering non-local quantum correlations of neuron firing
rates, would provide the key mechanism for neural quantum processing.
Implications, both in vitro and in vivo, are briefly mentioned.

consequent Euler variational principle for the density, are proved for
arbitrary electrostatic field and the constraint of fixed electron number. The
HK theorems are generalized for spinless electrons to the added presence of an
external uniform magnetostatic field by introducing the new constraint of fixed
canonical orbital angular momentum. Thereby a bijective relationship between
the external scalar and vector potentials, and the gauge invariant
nondegenerate ground state density and physical current density, is proved. A
corresponding Euler variational principle in terms of these densities is also
developed. These theorems are further generalized to electrons with spin by
imposing the added constraint of fixed canonical orbital and spin angular
momentum. The proofs differ from the original HK proof, and explicitly account
for the many-to-one relationship between the potentials and the nondegenerate
ground state wave function.
