depends on the initialization. This can be problematic in crowdsourcing and
other applications, e.g. when a small number of 'experts' are diluted by a
large number of noisy, unreliable participants. We develop a new EM algorithm
that is driven by these experts. In a manner that differs from other
approaches, we start from a single mixture class. The algorithm then develops
the set of 'experts' in a stagewise fashion based on a mutual information
criterion. At each stage EM operates on this subset of the players, effectively
regularizing the E rather than the M step. Experiments show that stagewise EM
outperforms other initialization techniques for crowdsourcing and neurosciences
applications, and can guide a full EM to results comparable to those obtained
knowing the exact distribution.

metal or semiconductor can induce a bulk magnetic moment. This effect is known
as the Edelstein (EE) or magneto-electric effect. Similarly, in a bulk
superconductor a phase gradient may create a finite spin density. The inverse
effect, also known as the spin-galvanic effect, corresponds to the creation of
a supercurrent by an equilibrium spin polarization. Here, by exploiting the
analogy between a linear-in-momentum SOC and a background SU(2) gauge field, we
develop a quasiclassical transport theory to deal with magneto-electric effects
in superconducting structures. For bulk superconductors this approach allows us
to easily reproduce and generalize a number of previously known results. For
Josephson junctions we establish a direct connection between the inverse EE and
the appearance of an anomalous phase-shift $\varphi_{0}$ in the current-phase
relation. In particular we show that $\varphi_{0}$ is proportional to the
equilibrium spin-current in the weak link. We also argue that our results are
valid generically, beyond the particular case of linear-in-momentum SOC. The
magneto-electric effects discussed in this study may find applications in the
emerging field of coherent spintronics with superconductors.

problems based on a frequency domain decomposition of the atomistic equations
of motion and the use of perfectly matched layer or PML boundaries. Unlike MD
wavepacket analysis, the current approach has the ability to simulate
scattering from individual phonon modes, including wavevectors in highly
dispersive regimes. Like the Atomistic Green's Function method, the technique
reduces scattering problems to a system of linear algebraic equations via a
sparse, banded matrix. However, the use of PML boundaries enables rapid
absorption of scattered wave energies at the boundaries, and provides a simple
and inexpensive interpretation of the scattered phonon energy flux calculated
from the energy dissipation rate in the PML. The accuracy of the method is
demonstrated on connected monoatomic chains, for which an analytic solution is
known. The parameters defining the PML are found to affect the performance and
guidelines for selecting optimal parameters are given. The method is used to
study the energy transmission coefficient for connected diatomic chains over
all available wavevectors for both optical and longitudinal phonons; it is
found that when there is discontinuity between sublattices, even connected
chains of equivalent acoustic impedence have near-zero transmission coefficient
for short wavelengths. The phonon scattering cross section of an embedded
nanocylinder is calculated for a wide range of frequencies to demonstrate the
extension of the method to high dimensions. The calculations match continuum
theory for long wavelength phonons and large cylinder radii, but otherwise show
complex physics including Mie oscillations which terminate when incident phonon
frequencies exceeds the maximum available frequency in the embedded
nanocylinder, and scattering efficiencies larger than two near the Brillouin

(ECMG$_{jcg}$) method, which makes it possible to solve 3D elliptic boundary
value problems on rectangular domains of over 100 million unknowns on a desktop
computer in minutes. First, by combining Richardson extrapolation and
tri-quadratic Serendipity interpolation techniques, we introduce a new
extrapolation formula to provide a good initial guess for the iterative
solution on the next finer grid, which is a third order approximation to the
finite element (FE) solution. And the resulting large sparse linear system from
the FE discretization is then solved by the Jacobi-preconditioned Conjugate
Gradient (JCG) method. Additionally, instead of performing a fixed number of
iterations as cascadic multigrid (CMG) methods, a relative residual stopping
criterion is used in iterative solvers, which enables us to obtain conveniently
the numerical solution with the desired accuracy. Moreover, a simple Richardson
extrapolation is used to cheaply get a fourth order approximate solution on the
entire fine grid. Test results are reported to show that ECMG$_{jcg}$ has much
better efficiency compared to the classical MG methods. Since the initial guess
for the iterative solution is a quite good approximation to the FE solution,
numerical results show that only few number of iterations are required on the
finest grid for ECMG$_{jcg}$ with an appropriate tolerance of the relative
residual to achieve full second order accuracy, which is particularly important
when solving large systems of equations and can greatly reduce the
computational cost. It should be pointed out that when the tolerance becomes
smaller, ECMG$_{jcg}$ still needs only few iterations to obtain fourth order
extrapolated solution on each grid, except on the finest grid. Finally, we
present the reason why our ECMG algorithms are so highly efficient for solving
such problems.

neglected. Here, by means of numerical simulations, we analyze dense,
frictionless, granular assemblies with the final goal to relate the elastic
moduli to the fabric state, i.e., to micro-structural averaged contact network
features as contact number density and anisotropy.
  The particle samples are first isotropically compressed and later
quasi-statically sheared under constant volume (undrained conditions). From
various static, relaxed configurations at different shear strains, now
infinitesimal strain steps are applied to ""measure"" the effective elastic
response; we quantify the strain needed so that plasticity in the sample
develops as soon as contact and structure rearrangements happen. Because of the
anisotropy induced by shear, volumetric and deviatoric stresses and strains are
cross-coupled via a single anisotropy modulus, which is proportional to the
product of deviatoric fabric and bulk modulus (i.e. the isotropic fabric).
Interestingly, the shear modulus of the material depends also on the actual
stress state, along with the contact configuration anisotropy.
  Finally, a constitutive model based on incremental evolution equations for
stress and fabric is introduced. By using the previously measured dependence of
the stiffness tensor (elastic moduli) on the microstructure, the theory is able
to predict with good agreement the evolution of pressure, shear stress and
deviatoric fabric (anisotropy) for an independent undrained cyclic shear test,
including the response to reversal of strain.

understood. Due to the steep mass-luminosity relation, massive main sequence
stars become very luminous. This brings their envelopes very close to the
Eddington limit. We are analysing stellar evolutionary models in which the
Eddington limit is reached and exceeded, and explore the rich diversity of
physical phenomena which take place in their envelopes, and investigate their
observational consequences. We use the grids of detailed stellar models by
Brott et al. (2011) and Koehler et al. (2015), to investigate the envelope
properties of core hydrogen burning massive stars. We find that at the stellar
surface, the Eddington limit is almost never reached, even for stars up to 500
Msun. When an appropriate Eddington limit is defined locally in the stellar
envelope, most stars more massive than 40 Msun actually exceed this limit, in
particular in the partial ionization zones of iron, helium or hydrogen. While
most models adjust their structure such that the local Eddington limit is
exceeded at most by a few per cent, our most extreme models do so by a factor
of more than seven. We find that the local violation of the Eddington limit has
severe consequences for the envelope structure, as it leads to envelope
inflation, convection, density inversions and possibly to pulsations. We find
that all models with luminosities higher than 4*10^5 Lsun i.e. stars above 40
Msun show inflation, with a radius increase of up to a factor of about 40. We
find that the hot edge of the S Dor variability region coincides with a line
beyond which our models are inflated by more than a factor of two, indicating a
possible connection between S Dor variability and inflation. Furthermore, our
coolest models show highly inflated envelopes with masses of up to several
solar masses, and appear to be candidates to produce major LBV eruptions.

elusive despite over a hundred years of research on the subject. The three main
theories of heterosis are dominance theory, overdominance theory, and epistasis
theory. Kacser and Burns (1981) identified the molecular basis of dominance,
which has greatly enhanced our understanding of its importance to heterosis.
This paper aims to explain how overdominance, and some features of epistasis,
can similarly emerge from the molecular dynamics of proteins. Possessing
multiple alleles at a gene locus results in the synthesis of different
allozymes at reduced concentrations. This in turn reduces the rate at which
each allozyme forms soluble oligomers, which are toxic and must be degraded,
because allozymes co-aggregate at low efficiencies. The model developed in this
paper will be used to explain how heterozygosity can impact the metabolic
efficiency of an organism. It can also explain why the viabilities of some
inbred lines seem to decline rapidly at high inbreeding coefficients (F > 0.5),
which may provide a physical basis for truncation selection for heterozygosity.
Finally, the model has implications for the ploidy level of organisms. It can
explain why polyploids are frequently found in environments where severe
physical stresses promote the formation of soluble oligomers. The model can
also explain why complex organisms, which need to synthesize aggregation-prone
proteins that contain intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) and multiple
domains because they facilitate complex protein interaction networks (PINs),
tend to be diploid while haploidy tends to be restricted to relatively simple
organisms.

of both random (""classical"") and correlated (""resonant"") encounters.
Steady-state solutions are similar to the Bahcall-Wolf solution but are
modified at small radii due to the higher rate of diffusion in angular
momentum, which results in a low-density core. The core radius is a few percent
of the influence radius of the SBH. The corresponding phase-space density
f(E,L) drops nearly to zero at low energies, implying almost no stars on
tightly-bound orbits about the SBH. Steady-state rates of stellar disruption
are presented, and a simple analytic expression is found that reproduces the
numerical feeding rates with good accuracy. The distribution of periapsides of
disrupted stars is also computed. Time-dependent solutions are also computed,
starting from initial conditions similar to those produced by a binary SBH. In
these models, feeding rates evolve on two timescales: rapid evolution during
which the region evacuated by the massive binary is refilled by
angular-momentum diffusion; and slower evolution as diffusion in energy causes
the density profile at large radii to attain the Bahcall-Wolf form.

individuals imitate the decisions and choices of others. A variety of global
phenomena, from innovation adoption to the emergence of social norms and

such as copy what others are doing. However, individuals often lack global
knowledge of the behaviors of others and must estimate them from the
observations of their friends' behaviors. In some cases, the structure of the
underlying social network can dramatically skew an individual's local
observations, making a behavior appear far more common locally than it is
globally. We trace the origins of this phenomenon, which we call ""the majority
illusion,"" to the friendship paradox in social networks. As a result of this
paradox, a behavior that is globally rare may be systematically overrepresented
in the local neighborhoods of many people, i.e., among their friends. Thus, the
""majority illusion"" may facilitate the spread of social contagions in networks

system formation. The ice giants' peculiar obliquities suggest that they both
suffered giant collisions during their formation. Thus, there must have been an
epoch of accretion dominated by collisions among large planetary embryos in the
primordial outer solar system. We test this idea using N-body numerical
simulations including the effects of a gaseous protoplanetary disk. One strong
constraint is that the masses of the ice giants are very similar -- the
Neptune/Uranus mass ratio is $\sim1.18$. We show that similar-size ice giants
do indeed form by collisions between planetary embryos beyond Saturn. The
fraction of successful simulations varies depending on the initial number of
planetary embryos in the system, their individual and total masses.
Similar-sized ice giants are consistently reproduced in simulations starting
with 5-10 planetary embryos with initial masses of $\sim$3-6 ${\rm M_\oplus}$.

investigated by a combination of radiotracer diffusion and molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, allowing to determine for the first time the effective
activation enthalpy of diffusion along shear bands in a deformed glass. The
shear bands relax during annealing below the glass transition temperature and
the diffusion enhancement reveals unexpectedly a non-monotonous behavior. The
development of shear bands and the subsequent relaxation of stresses after
switching off the shearing are characterized on microscopic to mesoscopic
length scales by MD simulation subjecting the model glass to a constant strain
rate. Mean-squared displacements as well as strain maps indicate that the
heterogeneity, as manifested by shear bands in the systems under shear, persist
after the shear is switched off. We observe a further relaxation of residual
stresses that remain localized in regions where the shear band has been present
before, although the system is - different from the macroscopic experiment -
homogeneous with respect to the local density. These results indicate that even
on a local scale one may expect strong dynamic heterogeneity in deformed glassy
solids due to shear banding. The results thus suggest that plastically deformed
metallic glasses present poly-amorphous systems that necessitate descriptions

both VLES and LES lies in a forward scattering mechanism by the Coulomb
potential. We parameterize the S matrix in terms of ?, which is the
displacement of the the classical motion of an electron in the laser field.
When ? = 0, the S matrix is singular, which we attribute to be forward Coulomb
scattering without absorption of light quanta. By devising a regularization
scheme, the resulting S matrix is non-singular when ? = 0, and the origins of
VLES and LES are revealed. We attribute VLES to multiple forward scattering of
near-threshold electrons by the Coulomb potential, with no absorption of light
quanta, signifying the role of the Coulomb threshold effect. We attribute LES
to be due to the combined role of the Coulomb threshold effect and rescattering
in the forward direction by the Coulomb potential with the absorption of light
quanta. A comparison of theory with experiment confirms these conclusions.
Further more, recently Dura et al. [Sci. Rep. 3, 2675 (2013)] reported the
detection of slow electrons at near zero momentum, at 1.3 meV, which is much
below the VLES, almost at threshold. Our theoretical formulation gives rise to
slow electrons at near zero momentum and at threshold. In addition, for
circularly polarized fields, it conserves the angular momentum in the
ionization process which necessitate the disappearance of the VLES, LES and the
slow electrons near threshold.

turning to biased Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures that trade off asymptotic
exactness for computational speed. The reasoning is sound: a reduction in
variance due to more rapid sampling can outweigh the bias introduced. However,
the inexactness creates new challenges for sampler and parameter selection,
since standard measures of sample quality like effective sample size do not
account for asymptotic bias. To address these challenges, we introduce a new
computable quality measure based on Stein's method that quantifies the maximum
discrepancy between sample and target expectations over a large class of test
functions. We use our tool to compare exact, biased, and deterministic sample
sequences and illustrate applications to hyperparameter selection, convergence
rate assessment, and quantifying bias-variance tradeoffs in posterior

  property","13 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The null space property (NSP) and the restricted isometry property (RIP) are
two properties which have received considerable attention in the compressed
sensing literature. As the name suggests, NSP is a property that depends solely
on the null space of the measurement procedure and as such, any two matrices
which have the same null space will have NSP if either one of them does. On the
other hand, RIP is a property of the measurement procedure itself, and given an
RIP matrix it is straightforward to construct another matrix with the same null
space that is not RIP. %Furthermore, RIP is known to imply NSP and therefore
RIP is a strictly stronger assumption than NSP. We say a matrix is RIP-NSP if
it has the same null space as an RIP matrix. We show that such matrices can
provide robust recovery of compressible signals under Basis pursuit which in
many applicable settings is comparable to the guarantee that RIP provides. More
importantly, we constructively show that the RIP-NSP is stronger than NSP with
the aid of this robust recovery result, which shows that RIP is fundamentally
stronger than NSP.

the most compact and meaningful representation of a given shape is achieved by
maximizing the re-use of existing building blocks or parts.
  The proposed stochastic wreath process extends Leyton's theory by defining a
probability distribution over geometric shapes in terms of noise processes that
are aligned with the generative group structure of the shape. We propose an

models containing a single scalar field non-minimally coupled to the metric.
Even though the parameter space is large, by exploiting an effective field
theory (EFT) formulation and by imposing simple physical constraints such as
stability conditions and (sub-)luminal propagation of perturbations, we arrive
at a number of generic predictions. (1) The linear growth rate of matter
density fluctuations is generally suppressed compared to $\Lambda$CDM at
intermediate redshifts ($0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1$), despite the introduction
of an attractive long-range scalar force. This is due to the fact that, in
self-accelerating models, the background gravitational coupling weakens at
intermediate redshifts, over-compensating the effect of the attractive scalar
force. (2) At higher redshifts, the opposite happens; we identify a period of
super-growth when the linear growth rate is larger than that predicted by
$\Lambda$CDM. (3) The gravitational slip parameter $\eta$ - the ratio of the
space part of the metric perturbation to the time part - is bounded from above.
For Brans-Dicke-type theories $\eta$ is at most unity. For more general
theories, $\eta$ can exceed unity at intermediate redshifts, but not more than
about $1.5$ if, at the same time, the linear growth rate is to be compatible
with current observational constraints. We caution against phenomenological
parametrization of data that do not correspond to predictions from viable
physical theories. We advocate the EFT approach as a way to constrain new
physics from future large-scale-structure data.

inhomogeneous flow patterns that strongly affect materials properties. Among
them, shear bands are ubiquitous in a wide variety of materials, ranging from
soft matter systems to metallic alloys. Shear banding is associated with strain
localization, i.e. the deformation of the sheared glassy solid is localized in
space in form of band-like structures. These structures are often precursors to
catastrophic failure, implying that a proper understanding of the underlying
mechanisms could lead to the design of smarter materials. However, despite its
importance in material science, the microscopic origin of shear banding in
glassy materials is only poorly understood. Here, the formation of shear
banding in glassy systems is revealed by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations (NEMD) of a binary Lennard-Jones mixture, subject to a constant
strain rate. In its glass state, this system exhibits for all considered strain
rates the formation of a percolating cluster of mobile regions at a critical
strain. We show that this percolation transition belongs to the universality
class of directed percolation. Only at low shear rates, where the steady-state
stress is close to the yielding threshold, the percolating cluster evolves into
a transient (but long-lived) shear band with a diffusive growth of its width.

by Abramsky and Coecke. The ZX-calculus was known to be incomplete for quantum
mechanics. On the other hand, its \pi/2-fragment is known to be complete, i.e.
the ZX-calculus is complete for the so called ""stabilizer quantum mechanics"".
Deciding whether its \pi/4-fragment is complete is a crucial step in the
development of the ZX-calculus since this fragment is approximately universal
for quantum mechanics, contrary to the \pi/2-fragment. To establish our
incompleteness result, we consider a fairly simple property of quantum states
called supplementarity. We show that supplementarity can be derived in the
ZX-calculus if and only if the angles involved in this equation are multiples
of \pi/2. In particular, the impossibility to derive supplementarity for \pi/4
implies the incompleteness of the ZX-calculus for Clifford+T quantum mechanics.
As a consequence, we propose to add the supplementarity to the set of rules of
the ZX-calculus. We also show that if a ZX-diagram involves antiphase twins,
they can be merged when the ZX-calculus is augmented with the supplementarity
rule. Merging antiphase twins makes diagrammatic reasoning much easier and
provides a purely graphical meaning to the supplementarity rule.

Minkowski or other intermediate spacetimes are ruled out as the locus of the
embedding by virtue of hidden influence inequalities. The complementarity
transferred from a simulation to the extension unifies a number of results
about quantum nonlocality, and implies that special relativity (SR) has a
different significance for the ontological model and for the operational theory
it reproduces. Only the latter, being experimentally accessible, is required to
be Lorentz covariant. There may be certain Lorentz non-covariant elements at
the ontological level, but they will be inaccessible at the operational level

Conway and Kochen (2009) and Colbeck and Renner (2012), are attributed to their

networks (ConvNets). The architecture, called SimNets, is driven by two
operators: (i) a similarity function that generalizes inner-product, and (ii) a
log-mean-exp function called MEX that generalizes maximum and average. The two
operators applied in succession give rise to a standard neuron but in ""feature
space"". The feature spaces realized by SimNets depend on the choice of the
similarity operator. The simplest setting, which corresponds to a convolution,
realizes the feature space of the Exponential kernel, while other settings
realize feature spaces of more powerful kernels (Generalized Gaussian, which
includes as special cases RBF and Laplacian), or even dynamically learned
feature spaces (Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning). As a result, the SimNet
contains a higher abstraction level compared to a traditional ConvNet. We argue
that enhanced expressiveness is important when the networks are small due to
run-time constraints (such as those imposed by mobile applications). Empirical
evaluation validates the superior expressiveness of SimNets, showing a
significant gain in accuracy over ConvNets when computational resources at
run-time are limited. We also show that in large-scale settings, where
computational complexity is less of a concern, the additional capacity of
SimNets can be controlled with proper regularization, yielding accuracies
comparable to state of the art ConvNets.

constraint of two H\""older inequalities and a time average from which emerges a
form for $\mathcal{F}_{m}$ which has been observed in previous numerical
Navier-Stokes and MHD simulations. When written as a phase plane in a scaled

Chandra X-ray observations of SNR G327.1-1.1 reveal a highly complex
morphology; a cometary structure resembling a bow shock, prong-like features
extending into large arcs in the SNR interior, and thermal emission from the
SNR shell. Spectral analysis of the non-thermal emission offers clues about the
origin of the PWN structures, while enhanced abundances in the PWN region
provide evidence for mixing of supernova ejecta with PWN material. The overall
morphology and spectral properties of the SNR suggest that the PWN has
undergone an asymmetric interaction with the SNR reverse shock (RS) that can
occur as a result of a density gradient in the ambient medium and/or a moving
pulsar that displaces the PWN from the center of the remnant. We present
hydrodynamical simulations of G327.1-1.1 that show that its morphology and
evolution can be described by a ~ 17,000 yr old composite SNR that expanded
into a density gradient with an orientation perpendicular to the pulsar's
motion. We also show that the RS/PWN interaction scenario can reproduce the

Carlo (MCMC) to obtain samples from intractable posterior distributions.
Unfortunately, MCMC algorithms are typically serial, and do not scale to the
large datasets typical of modern machine learning. The recently proposed
consensus Monte Carlo algorithm removes this limitation by partitioning the
data and drawing samples conditional on each partition in parallel (Scott et
al, 2013). A fixed aggregation function then combines these samples, yielding
approximate posterior samples. We introduce variational consensus Monte Carlo
(VCMC), a variational Bayes algorithm that optimizes over aggregation functions
to obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target. The
resulting objective contains an intractable entropy term; we therefore derive a
relaxation of the objective and show that the relaxed problem is blockwise
concave under mild conditions. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm on
three inference tasks from the literature, demonstrating both the superior
quality of the posterior approximation and the moderate overhead of the
optimization step. Our algorithm achieves a relative error reduction (measured
against serial MCMC) of up to 39% compared to consensus Monte Carlo on the task
of estimating 300-dimensional probit regression parameter expectations;
similarly, it achieves an error reduction of 92% on the task of estimating
cluster comembership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model with 8
components in 8 dimensions. Furthermore, these gains come at moderate cost
compared to the runtime of serial MCMC, achieving near-ideal speedup in some

gaps between the two first-ranked galaxies of a system ($\Delta m_{12}$). There

extreme of the distribution, the largest gaps are found among the so-called
fossil systems. Fossil and non-fossil systems could have different galaxy
populations that should be reflected in their luminosity functions. In this
work we study, for the first time, the dependence of the luminosity function
parameters on $\Delta m_{12}$ using data obtained by the fossil group origins
(FOGO) project. We constructed a hybrid luminosity function for 102 groups and
clusters at $z \le 0.25$. We stacked all the individual luminosity functions,
dividing them into bins of $\Delta m_{12}$, and studied their best-fit
Schechter parameters. We additionally computed a relative luminosity function,
expressed as a function of the central galaxy luminosity, which boosts our
capacity to detect differences, especially at the bright end. We find trends as
a function of $\Delta m_{12}$ at both the bright and faint ends of the
luminosity function. In particular, at the bright end, the larger the magnitude
gap, the fainter the characteristic magnitude $M^\ast$. We also find
differences at the faint end. In this region, the larger the gap, the flatter
the faint-end slope $\alpha$. The differences found at the bright end support a
dissipationless, dynamical friction-driven merging model for the growth of the
central galaxy in group- and cluster-sized halos. The differences in the faint
end cannot be explained by this mechanism. Other processes, such as enhanced
tidal disruption due to early infall and/or prevalence of eccentric orbits, may
play a role. However, a larger sample of systems with $\Delta m_{12} > 1.5$ is
needed to establish the differences at the faint end.

are the weakest lines ever observed in gamma-ray burst afterglows, suggesting
that GRB140515A exploded in a very low density environment. Its circum-burst
medium is characterised by an average extinction (A$_{\rm V} \sim 0.1$) that
seems to be typical of $z \ge 6$ events. The observed multi-band light curves
are explained either with a very flat injected spectrum ($p = 1.7$) or with a
multi-component emission ($p = 2.1$). In the second case a long-lasting central
engine activity is needed in order to explain the late time X-ray emission. The
possible origin of GRB140515A from a Pop III (or from a Pop II stars with local
environment enriched by Pop III) massive star is unlikely.

  $z\sim 2$","ApJ accepted. 14 pages. Comments welcome",,"10.1088/0004-637X/808/1/25",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have shown that the local mass-metallicity (M-Z) relation
depends on the specific star formation rate (SSFR). Whether such a dependence
exists at higher redshifts, and whether the resulting M-Z-SFR relation is
redshift invariant, is debated. We re-examine these issues by applying the
non-parametric techniques of Salim et al. (2014) to ~130 $z\sim2.3$ galaxies
with N2 and O3 measurements from KBSS (Steidel et al. 2014). We find that the
KBSS M-Z relation depends on SSFR at intermediate masses, where such dependence
exists locally. KBSS and SDSS galaxies of the same mass and SSFR (""local
analogs"") are similarly offset in the BPT diagram relative to the bulk of local
star-forming galaxies, and thus we posit that metallicities can be compared
self-consistently at different redshifts as long as the masses and SSFRs of the
galaxies are similar. We find that the M-Z-SFR relation of $z\sim2$ galaxies is
consistent with the local one at $\log M_*<10$, but is offset up to -0.25 dex
at higher masses, so it is altogether not redshift invariant. This high-mass
offset could arise from a bias that high-redshift spectroscopic surveys have
against high-metallicity galaxies, but additional evidence disfavors this
possibility. We identify three causes for the reported discrepancy between N2
and O3N2 metallicities at $z\sim2$: (1) a smaller offset that is also present
for SDSS galaxies, which we remove with new N2 calibration, (2) a genuine
offset due to differing ISM condition, which is also present in local analogs,
(3) an additional offset due to unrecognized AGN contamination.

($M*/M_\odot\sim10^{11}$) from z~3 in the 5 CANDELS fields. The progenitors are
selected using abundance matching techniques to account for the mass growth.
The morphologies strongly evolve from z~3. At z<1, the population matches the
massive end of the Hubble sequence, with 30% of spheroids, 50% of galaxies with
equally dominant disk and bulge components and 20% of disks. At z~2-3 there is
a majority of irregular systems (~60-70%) with still 30% of spheroids.
  We then analyze the SFRs, gas fractions and structural properties for the
different morphologies independently. Our results suggest two distinct channels
for the growth of bulges in massive galaxies.
  Around 30-40% were already bulges at z~2.5, with low average SFRs and
gas-fractions (10-15%), high Sersic indices (n>3-4) and small effective radii
($R_e$~1 kpc) pointing towards an early formation through gas-rich mergers or
VDI. Between z~ 2.5 and z~0, they rapidly increase their size by a factor of
~4-5, become all passive but their global morphology remains unaltered. The
structural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is
driven by ex-situ events.
  The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from
clumpy disks to more regular bulge+disks systems, essentially happening at z>1.
It results in the growth of a significant bulge component (n~3) for 2/3 of the
systems possibly through the migration of clumps while the remaining 1/3 keeps
a rather small bulge (n~1.5-2). The transition phase between disturbed and
relaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease of
the star formation activity and the gas fractions. The growth of the effective
radii scales roughly with $H(z)^{-1}$ and it is therefore consistent with the
expected growth of disks in galaxy haloes.

transition of star forming galaxies into massive (M_stars~10^11 Msun), compact
(r_e~1 kpc) quiescent galaxies, which takes place from z~3 to z~1.5. We use HST
grism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields,
more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these
data with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a
population of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, using
K-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0<z<2.5. They have a median
NII/Halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with SFR(tot)/SFR(Halpha)~10, and
have a large range of observed line widths. We infer from the kinematics and
spatial distribution of Halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized
gas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By
combining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are
consistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc to
V_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is
dominated by the dense stellar component. Next, we study the size and mass
evolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. Even though
individual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compaction
and mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed a
simple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r_e) ~ 0.3 d(log
M_stars). This mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within a
fixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density or
velocity dispersion threshold. As shown in other studies, the mode of growth
changes after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steep
track in the size-mass plane.

absolute normalization of the particle distributions and the resulting
synchrotron, inverse-Compton, and pion-decay emission in a largely

a wide range of parameters typical of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. We
describe some preliminary results for photon emission from shocks of different
Lorentz factors and outline how the Monte Carlo simulation can be generalized
and coupled to hydrodynamic simulations of GRB blast waves. We assume Bohm
diffusion for simplicity but emphasize that the nonlinear effects we describe

while the galaxy catalogs are modeled by populating the dark matter halos in

statistical properties: number density, ellipticities, two-point statistics,
density and velocity profiles. Considering the matter density field, we find
that voids in massive neutrino cosmologies are less evolved than those in the
corresponding massless neutrinos case: there is a larger number of small voids
and a smaller number of large ones, their profiles are less evacuated, and they
present a lower wall at the edge. Moreover, the degeneracy between $\sigma_8$

galaxy density field, we find that differences among cosmologies are difficult
to detect because of the small number of galaxy voids in the simulations.
Differences are instead present when looking at the matter density and velocity
profiles around these voids.

self-interaction of dark matter. Viability of the models of long-range
interacting DM crucially depends on the effectiveness of recombination of the
DM particles, making thereby their interaction short-range. Usually in numeric
calculations, recombination is described by cross section obtained on a
feasible quantum level. However in a wide range of parameter values, a
classical treatment, where the particles are bound due to dipole radiation, is
applicable. The cross sections, obtained in both approaches, are very different
and lead to diverse consequences. Classical cross section has a steeper
dependence on relative velocity, what leads to the fact that, after decoupling
of DM particles from thermal background of ""dark photons"" (carriers of DM
long-range interaction), recombination process does not ""freeze out"",
diminishing gradually density of unbound DM particles. Our simplified estimates
show, that at the taken parameter values (the mass of DM particle is $100$ GeV,
interaction constant is $100^{-1}$, and quite natural assumptions on initial
conditions, from which the result is very weakly dependent) the difference in
residual density reaches about $5$ orders of magnitude on pre-galactic stage.
This estimate takes into account thermal effects induced by dipole radiation
and recombination, which resulted in the increase of both temperature and
density of DM particles by a half order of magnitude.

formation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally between
super massive black holes and their host galaxies. This work aims to detect the
presence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect the
maximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. Currently,
there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations of
outflows at high redshift, $z>2$. We analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rm
L>10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in H-band using the
near-IR integral field spectrometer SINFONI at VLT. We perform a kinematic
analysis of the [OIII] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\AA$. [OIII] has a
complex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/s
and line widths up to 1500 km/s. Using the spectroastrometric method we infer
size of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. The properties of the
ionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, are
correlated with the AGN luminosity. The increase in outflow rate with
increasing AGN luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous AGN
pushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiation
pressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. We derive mass outflow rates
of about 6-700 M$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than those
observed in molecular outflows. Indeed physical properties of ionised outflows
show dependences on AGN luminosity which are similar to those of molecular
outflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that of
the molecular one. Alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised and
molecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

discovered close to two hundred transiting extrasolar planets in the past
several years. The strategy of these surveys is to look at a large field of
view and measure the brightnesses of its bright stars to around half a percent
per point precision, which is adequate for detecting hot Jupiters. Typically,
these surveys use CCD detectors to achieve high precision photometry. These
CCDs, however, are expensive relative to other consumer-grade optical imaging
devices, such as digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs). We look at the
possibility of using a digital single-lens reflex camera for precision
photometry. Specifically, we used a Canon EOS 60D camera that records light in
3 colors simultaneously. The DSLR was integrated into the HATNet survey and
collected observations for a month, after which photometry was extracted for
6600 stars in a selected stellar field. We found that the DSLR achieves a
best-case median absolute deviation (MAD) of 4.6 mmag per 180 s exposure when
the DSLR color channels are combined, and 1000 stars are measured to better
than 10 mmag (1%). Also, we achieve 10\,mmag or better photometry in the
individual colors. This is good enough to detect transiting hot Jupiters. We
performed a candidate search on all stars and found four candidates, one of
which is KELT-3b, the only known transiting hot Jupiter in our selected field.
We conclude that the Canon 60D is a cheap, lightweight device capable of useful
photometry in multiple colors.

is dominated by a hard power law with a photon index, $\Gamma$ ~ 0.65, and the
spectrum below 20 keV can be described by two blackbodies, a blackbody plus a
soft power law, or by a Comptonized blackbody model. We study the full
phase-resolved spectra using the electron-positron outflow model of Beloborodov

derived from INTEGRAL data by Hascoet et al. (2014). We find that a significant

calculations coexist in the literature. These parametrizations are used
somewhat arbitrarily in stellar evolution codes, based on what works best for a
given problem, or even for historical reasons related to the development of
each code. We bring attention to the fact that these different parametrizations
correspond to different physical regimes of overshooting, depending whether the
effects of radiation are dominant, marginal, or negligible. Our analysis is
based on previously published theoretical results, as well as multidimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of stellar convection where the interaction between
the convective region and a stably-stratified region is observed. Although the
underlying hydrodynamical processes are the same, the outcome of the
overshooting process is profoundly affected by radiative effects. Using a
simple picture of the scales involved in the overshooting process, we show how
three regimes are obtained, depending on the importance of radiative effects.
These three regimes correspond to the different behaviors observed in
hydrodynamical simulations so far, and to the three types of parametrizations
used in 1D codes. We suggest that the existing parametrizations for
overshooting should coexist in 1D stellar evolution codes, and should be
applied consistently at convective boundaries depending on the local physical
conditions.

functional mirror descent where one descends in the density space using a small

uses samples to approximate a function. We prove result of the first kind that,
with $m$ particles, PMD provides a posterior density estimator that converges
in terms of $KL$-divergence to the true posterior in rate $O(1/\sqrt{m})$. We
demonstrate competitive empirical performances of PMD compared to several
approximate inference algorithms in mixture models, logistic regression, sparse
Gaussian processes and latent Dirichlet allocation on large scale datasets.

of q>30au compared to the Earth's (a=1au and eccentricity e=(1-q/a) ~ 0.0167 or

family because they have similar perihelion distance and inclination with
respect to the ecliptic i=10--30deg. They also have similar argument of
perihelion omega=340+/-55deg. There is no ready explanation for their origin.

Baalrud and Jerome Daligault","Modified Enskog Kinetic Theory for Strongly Coupled Plasmas","12 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Concepts underlying the Enskog kinetic theory of hard-spheres are applied to
include short-range correlation effects in a model for transport coefficients
of strongly coupled plasmas. The approach is based on an extension of the
effective potential transport theory [S.~D.~Baalrud and J.~Daligault,
Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 110}, 235001 (2013)] to include an exclusion radius
surrounding individual charged particles that is associated with Coulomb
repulsion. This is obtained by analogy with the finite size of hard spheres in
Enskog's theory. Predictions for the self-diffusion and shear viscosity
coefficients of the one-component plasma are tested against molecular dynamics
simulations. The theory is found to accurately capture the kinetic
contributions to the transport coefficients, but not the potential
contributions that arise at very strong coupling ($\Gamma \gtrsim 30$).
Considerations related to a first-principles generalization of Enskog's kinetic
equation to continuous potentials are also discussed.

  Linear Regression with Non-Gaussian Errors",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian errors are sometimes inappropriate in a multivariate linear
regression setting because, for example, the data contain outliers. In such
situations, it is often assumed that the error density is a scale mixture of
multivariate normal densities that takes the form $f(\varepsilon) =
\int_0^\infty |\Sigma|^{-\frac{1}{2}} u^{\frac{d}{2}} \, \phi_d \big(
\Sigma^{-\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt{u} \, \varepsilon \big) \, h(u) \, du$, where $d$
is the dimension of the response, $\phi_d(\cdot)$ is the standard $d$-variate
normal density, $\Sigma$ is an unknown $d \times d$ positive definite scale
matrix, and $h(\cdot)$ is some fixed mixing density. Combining this alternative
regression model with a default prior on the unknown parameters results in a
highly intractable posterior density. Fortunately, there is a simple data
augmentation (DA) algorithm and a corresponding Haar PX-DA algorithm that can
be used to explore this posterior. This paper provides conditions (on $h$) for
geometric ergodicity of the Markov chains underlying these Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. These results are extremely important from a practical
standpoint because geometric ergodicity guarantees the existence of the central
limit theorems that form the basis of all the standard methods of calculating
valid asymptotic standard errors for MCMC-based estimators. The main result is
that, if $h$ converges to 0 at the origin at an appropriate rate, and
$\int_0^\infty u^{\frac{d}{2}} \, h(u) \, du < \infty$, then the DA and Haar
PX-DA Markov chains are both geometrically ergodic. This result is quite
far-reaching. For example, it implies the geometric ergodicity of the DA and
Haar PX-DA Markov chains whenever $h$ is generalized inverse Gaussian,
log-normal, inverted gamma (with shape parameter larger than $d/2$), or
Fr\'{e}chet (with shape parameter larger than $d/2$).

some of the most realistic string models to date, which possess N=1 spacetime
supersymmetry. Lack of evidence for supersymmetry at the LHC instigated recent
interest in non-supersymmetric heterotic-string vacua. We explore what may be
learned in this context from the quasi--realistic free fermionic models. We
show that constructions with a low number of families give rise to
proliferation of a priori tachyon producing sectors, compared to the
non--realistic examples, which typically may contain only one such sector. The
reason being that in the realistic cases the internal six dimensional space is
fragmented into smaller units. We present one example of a quasi--realistic,
non--supersymmetric, non--tachyonic, heterotic--string vacuum and compare the
structure of its massless spectrum to the corresponding supersymmetric vacuum.
While in some sectors supersymmetry is broken explicitly, i.e. the bosonic and
fermionic sectors produce massless and massive states, other sectors, and in
particular those leading to the chiral families, continue to exhibit fermi-bose
degeneracy. In these sectors the massless spectrum, as compared to the
supersymmetric cases, will only differ in some local or global U(1) charges. We
discuss the conditions for obtaining $n_b=n_f$ at the massless level in these
models. Our example model contains an anomalous U(1) symmetry, which generates
a tadpole diagram at one loop-order in string perturbation theory. We speculate
that this tadpole diagram may cancel the corresponding diagram generated by the
one-loop non-vanishing vacuum energy and that in this respect the
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric vacua should be regarded on equal
footing. Finally we discuss vacua that contain two supersymmetry generating
sectors.

interesting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagnetic
follow-up observations. In March 2012, the most significant neutrino alert
during the first three years of operation was issued by IceCube. In the
follow-up observations performed by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), a Type
IIn supernova (SN) PTF12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alert
direction, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. It has a redshift of
$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,
\mathrm{Mpc}$ and the Pan-STARRS1 survey shows that its explosion time was at
least 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that a
causal connection is unlikely. The a posteriori significance of the chance
detection of both the neutrinos and the SN at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$
within IceCube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. Also, a complementary
neutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.
Therefore, we consider the SN detection coincidental and the neutrinos
uncorrelated to the SN. However, the SN is unusual and interesting by itself:
It is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the SN IIn 2010jl,
and shows signs of interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense circumstellar
medium. High-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shock
acceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific SN. In this
paper, we describe the SN PTF12csy and present both the neutrino and
electromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

that the pore life-time is controlled by the solution viscosity and its opening

collapse is due to a non-linear interplay between the edge and the surface
tensions together with the pressure difference. Also, we discuss the connection

dwarfs although there is strong evidence that they do exist.
  AIMS. We performed a pilot study with the extreme-AO system on the
Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) on the Very
Large Telescopes (VLT) to look for giant planets around a young white dwarf, GD
50.
  METHODS. We were awarded science verification time on the new ESO instrument
SPHERE. Observations were made with the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and
Spectrograph in classical imaging mode in H band.
  RESULTS. Despite the faintness of the target (14.2 mag in R band), the AO
loop was closed and a strehl of 37\% was reached in H band. No objects were
detected around GD 50. We achieved a 5-sigma contrast of 6.2, 8.0 and 8.25 mags
at 0{\farcs}2, 0{\farcs}4 and 0{\farcs}6 and beyond, respectively. We exclude
any substellar objects more massive than 4.0 M$_\textrm{J}$ at 6.2 AU, 2.9
M$_\textrm{J}$ at 12.4 AU and 2.8 M$_\textrm{J}$ at 18.6 AU and beyond. This
rivals the previous upper limit set by Spitzer. We further show that SPHERE is
the most promising instrument available to search for close-in substellar

  network: A Poincar\'{e} map approach","27 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding traffic statics and dynamics in urban networks is critical to
develop effective control and management strategies. In this paper, we provide
a novel approach to study the traffic statics and dynamics in a signalized
double-ring network, which can provide insights into the operation of more
general signalized traffic networks. Under the framework of the link queue
model (LQM) and the assumption of a triangular traffic flow fundamental
diagram, the signalized double-ring network is studied as a switched affine
system. Due to periodic signal regulations, periodic density evolution orbits
are formed and defined as stationary states. A Poincar\'{e} map approach is
introduced to analyze the properties of such stationary states. With short
cycle lengths, closed-form Poincar\'{e} maps are derived. Stationary states and
their stability properties are obtained by finding and analyzing the fixed
points on the Poincar\'{e} maps. It is found that a stationary state can be
asymptotically stable, Lyapunov stable, or unstable. The impacts of retaining
ratios and initial densities on the macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) and
the gridlock times are analyzed. Multivaluedness and gridlock phenomena as well
as the unstable branch with non-zero average network flow-rates are observed on
the MFDs. With long cycle lengths, fixed points on the Poincar\'{e} maps are
solved numerically, and the obtained stationary states and the MFDs are very
similar to those with short cycle lengths.
  Compared with earlier studies, this paper provides an analytical framework
that can be used to provide complete and closed-form solutions to the statics
and dynamics of double-ring networks. This can lead to a better understanding
of how the combination of signalized intersections and turning maneuvers is
expected to impact network properties, like the MFD.

a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous
attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of
an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a
pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this
architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn
approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems -- finding planar
convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling
Salesman Problem -- using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve
over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize
to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize
beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these

supernova remnant (SNR) to investigate the properties of both the SN ejecta and
the circumstellar medium (CSM). For comparison, we have also analyzed two
similarly-aged, ejecta-dominated SNRs: Tycho's SNR, thought to be the remnant
of a typical Type Ia SN, and SNR 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
thought to be the remnant of an overluminous Type Ia SN. By simply comparing
the X-ray spectra, we find that line intensity ratios of iron-group elements
(IGE) to intermediate-mass elements (IME) for Kepler's SNR and SNR 0509-67.5
are much higher than those for Tycho's SNR. We therefore argue that Kepler is
the product of an overluminous Type Ia SN. This inference is supported by our
spectral modeling, which reveals the IGE and IME masses respectively to be
~0.95 M_sun and ~0.12 M_sun (Kepler's SNR), ~0.75 M_sun and ~0.34 M_sun (SNR
0509-67.5), and ~0.35 M_sun and ~0.70 M_sun (Tycho's SNR). We find that the CSM
component in Kepler's SNR consists of tenuous diffuse gas (~0.3 M_sun) present
throughout the entire remnant, plus dense knots (~0.035 M_sun). Both of these
components have an elevated N abundance (N/H ~ 4 times the solar value),
suggesting that they originate from CNO-processed material from the progenitor
system. The mass of the diffuse CSM allows us to infer the pre-SN mass-loss
rate to be ~1.5e-5 (V_w/10 km/s) M_sun/yr, in general agreement with results
from recent hydrodynamical simulations. Since the dense knots have slow proper
motions and relatively small ionization timescales, they were likely located a
few pc away from the progenitor system. Therefore, we argue that Kepler's SN
was an overluminous event that started to interact with massive CSM a few
hundred years after the explosion. This supports the possible link between
overluminous SNe and the so-called ""Ia-CSM"" SNe.

  The Fourier decomposition of RRab and RRc light curves was used to
independently estimate the mean cluster value of [Fe/H] and distance. From the
RRab stars we found [Fe/H]$_{\rm UVES}$=$-1.31 \pm 0.01{\rm(statistical)} \pm
0.12{\rm(systematic)}$ ([Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}=-1.42$),and a distance of $30.0\pm

the independent estimates of the cluster distance from the tip of the RGB,

The distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the horizontal branch shows a clear
empirical border between stable fundamental and first overtone pulsators which
has been noted in several other clusters; we interpret it as the red edge of

in the context of these kinematic profiles and likelihoods are assigned to
quantify whether a star matches the underlying profile. Since some of these
stars are likely to have been ejected from the disc, we trace back their orbits
in order to determine potential ejection radii. We find that objects with low

importantly, have a tendency to originate from the inner Galaxy compared to the
underlying population.
  We also compose a sample of stars with velocities exceeding the local escape
velocity. Although we do not discount that our sample could be contaminated by
objects with spurious proper motions, a number of stars appear to have been
ejected from the disc with exceptionally high velocities. Some of these are
consistent with being ejected from the spiral arms and hence are a rich
resource for further study. Finally we look at objects whose orbits are
consistent with them being ejected at high speeds from the Galactic center. Of
these objects we find that one, J135855.65+552538.19, is inconsistent with

We demonstrate that this new mean spike train properly represents the average
pattern in the conventional fashion, and can be effectively computed using a
theoretically-proven convergent procedure. We compare this mean with other
spike train averages and demonstrate its superiority. Furthermore, we apply the
new framework in a recording from rodent geniculate ganglion, where background
firing activity is a common issue for neural coding. We show that the proposed

  3D-Stacked Memory Interface",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Limited memory bandwidth is a critical bottleneck in modern systems.
3D-stacked DRAM enables higher bandwidth by leveraging wider
Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) channels, but today's systems cannot fully exploit
them due to the limited internal bandwidth of DRAM. DRAM reads a whole row
simultaneously from the cell array to a row buffer, but can transfer only a
fraction of the data from the row buffer to peripheral IO circuit, through a
limited and expensive set of wires referred to as global bitlines. In presence
of wider memory channels, the major bottleneck becomes the limited data
transfer capacity through these global bitlines. Our goal in this work is to
enable higher bandwidth in 3D-stacked DRAM without the increased cost of adding
more global bitlines. We instead exploit otherwise-idle resources, such as
global bitlines, already existing within the multiple DRAM layers by accessing
the layers simultaneously. Our architecture, Simultaneous Multi Layer Access
(SMLA), provides higher bandwidth by aggregating the internal bandwidth of
multiple layers and transferring the available data at a higher IO frequency.
  To implement SMLA, simultaneous data transfer from multiple layers through
the same IO TSVs requires coordination between layers to avoid channel
conflict. We first study coordination by static partitioning, which we call
Dedicated-IO, that assigns groups of TSVs to each layer. We then provide a
simple, yet sophisticated mechanism, called Cascaded-IO, which enables
simultaneous access to each layer by time-multiplexing the IOs. By operating at
a frequency proportional to the number of layers, SMLA provides a higher
bandwidth (4X for a four-layer stacked DRAM). Our evaluations show that SMLA
provides significant performance improvement and energy reduction (55%/18% on
average for multi-programmed workloads, respectively) over a baseline
3D-stacked DRAM with very low area overhead.

abundance of large data sets that are too big to be analyzed in their entirety,

communication-free parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been
developed for Bayesian analysis of big data. These methods partition data into
manageable subsets, perform independent Bayesian MCMC analysis on each subset,
and combine the subset posterior samples to estimate the full data posterior.
Current approaches to combining subset posterior samples include sample
averaging, weighted averaging, and kernel smoothing techniques. Although these
methods work well for Gaussian posteriors, they are not well-suited to
non-Gaussian posterior distributions. Here, we develop a new direct density
product method for combining subset marginal posterior samples to estimate full
data marginal posterior densities. Using a commonly-implemented distance
metric, we show in simulation studies of Bayesian models with non-Gaussian
posteriors that our method outperforms the existing methods in approximating
the full data marginal posteriors. Since our method estimates only marginal
densities, there is no limitation on the number of model parameters analyzed.
Our procedure is suitable for Bayesian models with unknown parameters with

large data sets. A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly
parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets
and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior
draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final
approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation
accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new
EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies
random partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is
distribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales. We
provide theoretical justification and extensive experiments illustrating
empirical performance.

the structural simplicity of error mechanisms. Specifically, we consider
channel models, called \emph{samplable additive channels}, in which (a) errors
are efficiently sampled without the knowledge of the coding scheme or the
transmitted codeword; (b) the entropy of the error distribution is bounded; and
(c) the number of errors introduced by the channel is unbounded. For the
channels, several negative and positive results are provided. Assuming the
existence of one-way functions, there are samplable additive errors of entropy
$n^{\epsilon}$ for $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ that are pseudorandom, and thus not
correctable by efficient coding schemes. It is shown that there is an oracle
algorithm that induces a samplable distribution over $\{0,1\}^n$ of entropy $m

schemes of rate less than $1 - m/n - o(1)$. The results indicate that
restricting error mechanisms to be efficiently samplable and not pseudorandom

hydrogen-burning stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects via disc
fragmentation. As disc fragmentation results in the formation of several bodies
at comparable distances to the host star, their orbits are generally unstable.
Here, we study the dynamical evolution of these objects. We set up the initial
conditions based on the outcomes of the SPH simulations of Stamatellos &
Whitworth, and for comparison we also study the evolution of systems resulting
from lower-mass fragmenting discs. We refer to these two sets of simulations as
set 1 and set 2. At 10 Myr, approximately half of the host stars have one
companion left, and approximately 22% (set 1) to 9.8% (set 2) of the host stars
are single. Systems with multiple secondaries in relatively stable
configurations are common (about 30% and 44%, respectively). The majority of
the companions are ejected within 1 Myr with velocities mostly below 5 km/s,
with some runaway escapers with velocities over 30 km/s. About 6% (set 1) and
2% (set 2) of the companions pair up into very low-mass binary systems. The
majority of these pairs escape as very low-mass binaries, while others remain
bound to the host star in hierarchical configurations (often with retrograde

the first singlepass simulator dependent on the FIFO cache properties to reduce
simulation time significantly. CIPARSim simulation time was up to 5 times
faster compared to the state of the art singlepass FIFO cache simulator for the

on a circle at high temperature for the two-dimensional conformal field theory
(CFT) dual to pure AdS$_3$ gravity. In the field theory, the R\'enyi entropy is
encoded in the CFT partition function on $n$-sheeted torus connected with each
other by a large branch cut. As proposed by Chen and Wu [Large interval limit
of R\'enyi entropy at high temperature, arXiv:1412.0763], the effective way to
read the entropy in the large interval limit is to insert a complete set of
state bases of the twist sector at the branch cut. Then the calculation
transforms into an expansion of four-point functions in the twist sector with
respect to $e^{-\frac{2\pi TR}{n}}$. By using the operator product expansion of
the twist operators at the branch points, we read the first few terms of the
R\'enyi entropy, including the leading and next-to-leading contributions in the
large central charge limit. Moreover, we show that the leading contribution is
actually captured by the twist vacuum module. In this case by the Ward identity
the four-point functions can be derived from the correlation function of four
twist operators, which is related to double interval entanglement entropy.
Holographically, we apply the recipe in [T. Faulkner, The entanglement R\'enyi
entropies of disjoint intervals in AdS/CFT, arXiv:1303.7221] and [T. Barrella
et al., Holographic entanglement beyond classical gravity, J. High Energy Phys.
09 (2013) 109] to compute the classical R\'enyi entropy and its one-loop
quantum correction, after imposing a new set of monodromy conditions. The
holographic classical result matches exactly with the leading contribution in
the field theory up to $e^{-4\pi TR}$ and $l^6$, while the holographical
one-loop contribution is in exact agreement with next-to-leading results in
field theory up to $e^{-\frac{6\pi TR}{n}}$ and $l^4$ as well.

the Raman laser light shifts on the phase of a Raman-type atom gravimeter.
Frequency chirps are applied to the Raman lasers in order to compensate gravity
and ensure the resonance of the Raman pulses during the interferometer. We show
that the change in the Raman light shift when this chirp is applied only to one
of the two Raman lasers is enough to bias the gravity measurement by a fraction
of $\mu$Gal ($1~\mu$Gal~=~$10^{-8}$~m/s$^2$). We also show that this effect is
not compensated when averaging over the two directions of the Raman wavevector
$k$. This thus constitutes a limit to the rejection efficiency of the
$k$-reversal technique. Our analysis allows us to separate this effect from the
effect of the finite speed of light, which we find in perfect agreement with
expected values. This study highlights the benefit of chirping symmetrically

multiplicative noise, often drawn from the Bernoulli distribution (or
'dropout'), provides regularization that has significantly contributed to deep
learning's success. However, understanding how multiplicative corruptions
prevent overfitting has been difficult due to the complexity of a DNN's
functional form. In this paper, we show that when a Gaussian prior is placed on
a DNN's weights, applying multiplicative noise induces a Gaussian scale
mixture, which can be reparameterized to circumvent the problematic likelihood
function. Analysis can then proceed by using a type-II maximum likelihood
procedure to derive a closed-form expression revealing how regularization
evolves as a function of the network's weights. Results show that
multiplicative noise forces weights to become either sparse or invariant to
rescaling. We find our analysis has implications for model compression as it
naturally reveals a weight pruning rule that starkly contrasts with the
commonly used signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While the SNR prunes weights with
large variances, seeing them as noisy, our approach recognizes their robustness
and retains them. We empirically demonstrate our approach has a strong
advantage over the SNR heuristic and is competitive to retraining with soft
targets produced from a teacher model.

computed by the least squares orbit determination. We test both the convergence
of the orbit determination iterative procedure and the behaviour of the
uncertainties as a function of the maximum number $n$ of map iterations
observed. When the initial conditions belong to a chaotic orbit, the orbit
determination is made impossible by numerical instability beyond a
computability horizon, which can be approximately predicted by a simple
formula. Moreover, the uncertainty of the results is sharply increased if a
dynamical parameter is added to the initial conditions as parameter to be
estimated. The uncertainty of the dynamical parameter decreases like $n^a$ with
$a<0$ but not large (of the order of unity). If only the initial conditions are
estimated, their uncertainty decreases exponentially with $n$. If they belong
to a non-chaotic orbit the computational horizon is much larger, if it exists
at all, and the decrease of the uncertainty is polynomial in all parameters,

shorter than 5 days in the SuperWASP All-Sky Survey and X-ray counterparts in
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey were chosen to create a catalog of several thousand
rapidly-rotating, X-ray active FGK stars. These objects are expected to be
either young single stars or tidally-locked spectroscopic binaries. We obtained
optical spectra for a sub-sample of 146 stars to determine their ages and
kinematics, and in some cases repeat radial velocity (RV) measurements were
used to identify binarity. Twenty-six stars are found to have lithium
abundances consistent with an age of <=200 Myr, and show no evidence for
binarity and in most cases measurements of H-alpha and v\sin i support their
youthful status. Based on their youth, their radial velocities and estimates of
their 3-dimensional kinematics, we find 11 objects that may be members of known
MGs, 8 that do not appear associated with any young MG and a further 7 that are
close to the kinematics of the recently proposed ""Octans-Near"" MG, and which
may be the first members of this MG found in the northern hemisphere. The
initial search mechanism was ~18 per cent efficient at identifying
likely-single stars younger than 200 Myr, of which 80 per cent were early-K
spectral types.

analysis has been performed using both bulk single crystal MoS2 samples and
atomically thin MoS2 layers. Raman spectra have been measured under
non-resonant and resonant conditions using seven different excitation
wavelengths from near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV). These measurements
have allowed to observe and identify 41 peaks, among which 22 have not been
previously experimentally observed for this compound, characterizing the
existence of different resonant excitation conditions for the different

the analysis of atomically thin MoS2 layers has corroborated the higher
potential of UV resonant Raman scattering measurements for the non destructive

expansion of our Universe. To test the viability of an $f(R)$ gravity model
through cosmic observations, the background evolution and the
Einstein-Boltzmann equation should be solved for studying the effects on the
cosmic microwave background power spectrum and on the matter power spectrum. In
the market, we already have the modified versions of {\bf CAMB} code, for
instance {\bf EFTCAMB} and {\bf MGCAMB}. However, in these publicly available
Einstein-Boltzmann codes, a specific background cosmology, for example the
$\Lambda$CDM or $w$CDM, is assumed. This assumption would be non-proper for a
specific $f(R)$ model where the background evolution may be different from a
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Therefore the main task for this paper is to present a
code to calculate the anisotropies in the microwave background for any $f(R)$
gravity model based on {\bf CAMB} code, i.e. {\bf FRCAMB}, where the background
and perturbation evolutions are included consistently. As results, one can
treat {\bf FRCAMB} as a blackbox to output the CMB power spectrum and matter
power spectrum, once an $f(R)$ function, its first two derivative with respect
to $R$, i.e. $f_R\equiv df/dR$, $f_{RR}\equiv d^2f/dR^2$ and the reasonable
values of the model parameters are inputted properly. As by-products, one can
also output the effective equation of state of $f(R)$ model, the evolution of
the dimensionless energy densities and other interesting cosmological
quantities.

in low dimensions is typically anomalous, with a size-dependent heat
conductivity, though the nature of the anomaly remains puzzling. The
conventional wisdom, supported by renormalization-group arguments and
mode-coupling approximations within fluctuating hydrodynamics, is that the
anomaly is universal in 1d momentum-conserving systems and belongs in the
Levy/Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Here we challenge this picture by
using a novel scaling method to show unambiguously that universality breaks
down in the paradigmatic 1d diatomic hard-point fluid. Hydrodynamic profiles
for a broad set of gradients, densities and sizes all collapse onto an
universal master curve, showing that (anomalous) Fourier's law holds even deep
into the nonlinear regime. This allows to solve the macroscopic transport
problem for this model, a solution which compares flawlessly with data and,
interestingly, implies the existence of a bound on the heat current in terms of
pressure. These results question the renormalization-group and mode-coupling
universality predictions for anomalous Fourier's law in 1d, offering a new
perspective on transport in low dimensions.

characteristics of Orion KL in the 1.3 cm band. We carried out a spectral line
survey (17.9 GHz to 26.2 GHz) with the Effelsberg-100 m telescope towards Orion
KL. We find 261 spectral lines, yielding an average line density of about 32
spectral features per GHz above 3$\sigma$. The identified lines include 164
radio recombination lines (RRLs) and 97 molecular lines. A total of 23
molecular transitions from species known to exist in Orion KL are detected for
the first time in the interstellar medium. Non-metastable 15NH3 transitions are
detected in Orion KL for the first time. Based on the velocity information of
detected lines and the ALMA images, the spatial origins of molecular emission
are constrained and discussed. A narrow feature is found in SO2
($8_{1,7}-7_{2,6}$), possibly suggesting the presence of a maser line. Column
densities and fractional abundances relative to H2 are estimated for 12
molecules with LTE methods. Rotational diagrams of non-metastable 14NH3
transitions with J=K+1 to J=K+4 yield different results; metastable 15NH3 is
found to have a higher excitation temperature than non-metastable 15NH3,
indicating that they may trace different regions. Elemental and isotopic
abundance ratios are estimated: 12C/13C=63+-17, 14N/15N=100+-51,
D/H=0.0083+-0.0045. The dispersion of the He/H ratios derived from
H$\alpha$/He$\alpha$ pairs to H$\delta$/He$\delta$ pairs is very small, which
is consistent with theoretical predictions that the departure coefficients bn
factors for hydrogen and helium are nearly identical. Based on a non-LTE code
neglecting excitation by the infrared radiation field and a likelihood
analysis, we find that the denser regions have lower kinetic temperature, which
favors an external heating of the Hot Core.

finder observation of blazar 3C 279 with the APEX telescope in Chile, the
phased submillimeter array (SMA), and the SMT of the Arizona Radio Observatory
(ARO). We installed VLBI equipment and measured the APEX station position to 1
cm accuracy (1 sigma). We then observed 3C 279 on 2012 May 7 in a 5 hour 230
GHz VLBI track with baseline lengths of 2800 M$\lambda$ to 7200 M$\lambda$ and
a finest fringe spacing of 28.6 micro-arcseconds. Fringes were detected on all
baselines with SNRs of 12 to 55 in 420 s. The correlated flux density on the
longest baseline was ~0.3 Jy/beam, out of a total flux density of 19.8 Jy.
Visibility data suggest an emission region <38 uas in size, and at least two
components, possibly polarized. We find a lower limit of the brightness
temperature of the inner jet region of about 10^10 K. Lastly, we find an upper
limit of 20% on the linear polarization fraction at a fringe spacing of ~38
uas. With APEX the angular resolution of 230 GHz VLBI improves to 28.6 uas.
This allows one to resolve the last-photon ring around the Galactic Center
black hole event horizon, expected to be 40 uas in diameter, and probe radio
jet launching at unprecedented resolution, down to a few gravitational radii in
galaxies like M 87. To probe the structure in the inner parsecs of 3C 279 in
detail, follow-up observations with APEX and five other mm-VLBI stations have
been conducted (March 2013) and are being analyzed.

of spiral galaxies have previously been inferred from observations to be
systematically larger in magnitude than predicted by standard mean-field dynamo
theory. This discrepancy is more pronounced if dynamo growth has saturated,
which is reasonable to assume given that such fields are generally inferred to
be close to energy equipartition with the interstellar turbulence. This 'pitch
angle problem' is explored using local numerical mean-field dynamo solutions as
well as asymptotic analytical solutions. It is first shown that solutions in
the saturated or kinematic regimes depend on only five dynamo parameters, two
of which are tightly constrained by observations of galaxy rotation curves. The
remaining 3-dimensional (dimensionless) parameter space can be constrained to
some extent using theoretical arguments. Predicted values of $|p|$ can be as
large as $\sim40^\circ$, which is similar to the largest values inferred from
observations, but only for a small and non-standard region of parameter space.
We argue, based on independent evidence, that such non-standard parameter
values are plausible. However, these values are located toward the boundary of
the allowed parameter space, suggesting that additional physical effects may
need to be incorporated. We therefore suggest possible directions for extending
the basic model considered.

paper, we extend the Smart Sampling Kalman Filter (S2KF) with a new point
symmetric Gaussian sampling scheme. This not only improves the S2KF's
estimation quality, but also reduces the time needed to compute the required
optimal Gaussian samples drastically. Moreover, we improve the numerical

a thousand-dimensional Gaussian distribution using tens of thousands of

higher-order moments of standard normal distributions and investigate the
estimation quality of the S2KF when dealing with symmetric measurement
equations. Finally, extended object tracking based on many measurements per

advantage of the S2KF being able to use an arbitrary number of samples

CLIC. We developed a novel method for evaluating the energy spectrum of
electrons emitting the undulator- and the inverse Compton radiation. The method
based on Poisson weighted superposition of electron states is applicable for
whole range of the emission intensity per electron pass through the driving
force, from much less than unity emitted photons (Compton sources) to many
photons emitted (undulators), and for any energy of the photons. The method
allows for account contributions in the energy spread both from the Poisson
statistics and diffusion due to recoils. The theoretical results were confirmed
by simulations. The electron energy spectrum was used for evaluation of the
on-axis density of photons and their coherency making use of the
`carrier--envelope' presentation for the emitting photons. The evaluated
maximum coherency degree of single--electron radiation is evaluated to be
proportional to the undulator spatial period and inversely to the energy of
electrons, the number of coherently emitted undulator periods almost
independent of the undulator deflection parameter. The results of our study are

polylogarithmic approximation guarantee; moreover, for important practical
classes of graphs, it runs in a number of rounds asymptotically smaller than
those required by the natural approximation provided by the state-of-the-art
$\Delta$-stepping SSSP algorithm, which is its only practical linear-space
competitor in the aforementioned computational scenario. We complement our
theoretical findings with an extensive experimental analysis on large benchmark
graphs, which demonstrates that our algorithm attains substantial improvements
on a number of key performance indicators with respect to the aforementioned

less than 1.4, as opposed to the polylogarithmic theoretical bound).

$v\circ\pi_Y$, where $Y$ runs over the set of all linear subspaces of $X$,
$\pi_Y$ is the projection of $X$ onto the quotient $X/Y$, and
$v:X/Y\to\mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function that has uniform radial limits at

crossed product $\mathscr{E}(X) := \mathcal{E}(X)\rtimes X$ is well defined;
the Hamiltonians that are of interest to us are the self-adjoint operators
affiliated to it. We determine the characters of $\mathcal{E}(X)$. This then

multi-armed bandit problems, focusing on performance guarantees that hold with
high probability. Such results are rather scarce in the literature since
proving them requires a large deal of technical effort and significant
modifications to the standard, more intuitive algorithms that come only with
guarantees that hold on expectation. One of these modifications is forcing the
learner to sample arms from the uniform distribution at least
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ times over $T$ rounds, which can adversely affect
performance if many of the arms are suboptimal. While it is widely conjectured
that this property is essential for proving high-probability regret bounds, we
show in this paper that it is possible to achieve such strong results without
this undesirable exploration component. Our result relies on a simple and
intuitive loss-estimation strategy called Implicit eXploration (IX) that allows
a remarkably clean analysis. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique,
we derive several improved high-probability bounds for various extensions of
the standard multi-armed bandit framework. Finally, we conduct a simple

strong preference to the liquid phase of the fluid, or one of the components of
the mixture. The slabs influence the fluid by long-range competing dispersion
potentials. Under such conditions one usually expects {\it attractive} Casimir
force governed by universal scaling function to which the dispersion potentials
provide only corrections to scaling. We demonstrate, however, that below a
given $L<L_{\rm crit}$ the competition between the effects due to the coatings
and the slabs can result in {\it sign change} of the Casimir force when one
changes the temperature $T$, the chemical potential of the fluid $\mu$, or $L$.

Casimir force with {\it non-universal} behavior which, upon increasing $L$,
gradually turns into an {\it attractive} one described by an {\it universal}

group II based on their far-infrared spectral energy distribution, and the
common interpretation for that is flared and flat disks. Recent observations
suggest that many flaring disks have gaps, whereas flat disks are thought to be
gapless. The different groups of objects can be expected to have different
structural signatures in high-angular-resolution data. Over the past 10 years,
the MIDI instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer has collected
observations of several tens of protoplanetary disks. We model the large set of
observations with simple geometric models. A population of radiative-transfer
models is synthesized for interpreting the mid-infrared signatures. Objects
with similar luminosities show very different disk sizes in the mid-infrared.
Restricting to the young objects of intermediate mass, we confirm that most
group I disks are in agreement with being transitional. We find that several
group II objects have mid-infrared sizes and colors overlapping with sources
classified as group I, transition disks. This suggests that these sources have
gaps, which has been demonstrated for a subset of them. This may point to an
intermediate population between gapless and transition disks. Flat disks with
gaps are most likely descendants of flat disks without gaps. Gaps, potentially
related to the formation of massive bodies, may therefore even develop in disks
in a far stage of grain growth and settling. The evolutionary implications of
this new population could be twofold. Either gapped flat disks form a separate
population of evolved disks, or some of them may further evolve into flaring
disks with large gaps. The latter transformation may be governed by the
interaction with a massive planet, carving a large gap and dynamically exciting
the grain population in the disk.

base flow happens to introduce inertial recirculations in the meridional plane
at the first order, which are shown to follow two radically different
mechanisms: inverse Ekman pumping driven by a vertical pressure gradient along
the axis of the vortex, or direct Ekman pumping driven by a radial pressure
gradient in the Hartman boundary layers. We demonstrate that when the base flow
is quasi-2D, the relative importance of direct and inverse pumping is solely
determined by the aspect ratio $\eta / h$, where $\eta$ refers to the width of
the vortex. Of both mechanisms, only inverse pumping appears to act as a
significant source of helicity.

consists of a new scalar charged under a new SU$(N)_D$ gauge group, singlet
under all Standard Model gauge interactions, and coupled with the Standard
Model only via a Higgs portal. We assume that the theory is classically
conformal, with electroweak symmetry breaking dynamically induced via the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism operating in the hidden sector. Due to the symmetry
breaking pattern, the SU$(N)_D$ gauge group is completely Higgsed and the
resulting massive vectors of the hidden sector constitute a stable dark matter
candidate. We perform a thorough scan over the parameter space of the model at
different values of $N=2$, $3$, and $4$, and investigate the phenomenological
constraints. We find that $N=2,3$ provide the most appealing model setting in
light of present data from colliders and dark matter direct search experiments.

the same way that Fermionic correlations in thermodynamic systems are relevant
only in the limit of low temperature, the intrinsic correlations in scale-free

a meta-model relying on a Gaussian process emulator is proposed to replace this

long-standing open problem and even capacity outer bounds are little known in
general. A significant progress on degrees-of-freedom (DoF) analysis, a
first-order capacity approximation, for the $K$-user GIC has provided new
important insights into the problem of interest in the high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) limit. However, such capacity approximation has been observed to
have some limitations in predicting the capacity at \emph{finite} SNR. In this
work, we develop a new upper-bounding technique that utilizes a new type of
genie signal and applies \emph{time sharing} to genie signals at $K$ receivers.
Based on this technique, we derive new upper bounds on the sum capacity of the
three-user GIC with constant, complex channel coefficients and then generalize
to the $K$-user case to better understand sum-rate behavior at finite SNR. We
also provide closed-form expressions of our upper bounds on the capacity of the
$K$-user symmetric GIC easily computable for \emph{any} $K$. From the
perspectives of our results, some sum-rate behavior at finite SNR is in line
with the insights given by the known DoF results, while some others are not. In
particular, the well-known $K/2$ DoF achievable for almost all constant real
channel coefficients turns out to be not embodied as a substantial performance
gain over a certain range of the cross-channel coefficient in the $K$-user
symmetric real case especially for \emph{large} $K$. We further investigate the
impact of phase offset between the direct-channel coefficient and the
cross-channel coefficients on the sum-rate upper bound for the three-user
\emph{complex} GIC. As a consequence, we aim to provide new findings that could
not be predicted by the prior works on DoF of GICs.

Interference Channel (GIC) is known to be the intersection of regions of
various bounds including genie-aided outer bounds, in which a genie provides
noisy input signals to the intended receiver. The Han and Kobayashi (HK) scheme
provides the best known inner bound. The rate difference between the best known
lower and upper bounds on the sum capacity remains as large as 1 bit per
channel use especially around $g^2=P^{-1/3}$, where $P$ is the symmetric power
constraint and $g$ is the symmetric real cross-channel coefficient. In this
paper, we pay attention to the \emph{moderate interference regime} where
$g^2\in (\max(0.086, P^{-1/3}),1)$. We propose a new upper-bounding technique
that utilizes noisy observation of interfering signals as genie signals and
applies time sharing to the genie signals at the receivers. A conditional
version of the worst additive noise lemma is also introduced to derive new
capacity bounds. The resulting upper (outer) bounds on the sum capacity
(capacity region) are shown to be tighter than the existing bounds in a certain
range of the moderate interference regime. Using the new upper bounds and the
HK lower bound, we show that $R_\text{sym}^*=\frac{1}{2}\log
\big(|g|P+|g|^{-1}(P+1)\big)$ characterizes the capacity of the symmetric real
GIC to within $0.104$ bit per channel use in the moderate interference regime
at any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We further establish a high-SNR
characterization of the symmetric real GIC, where the proposed upper bound is
at most $0.1$ bit far from a certain HK achievable scheme with Gaussian
signaling and time sharing for $g^2\in (0,1]$. In particular, $R_\text{sym}^*$
is achievable at high SNR by the proposed HK scheme and turns out to be the
high-SNR capacity at least at $g^2=0.25, 0.5$.

first-principles model that fully takes into account both electronic and

limitations of applicability of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strongly
coupled molecule-cavity structures. For the case of two molecules, we also show
how dark states, which within the two-level picture are effectively decoupled
from the cavity, are indeed affected by the formation of collective strong

bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate estimates of the target

translates into improved parameter learning when NASMC is used as a subroutine

steady states, are a generic feature of many nonlinear systems. Recently these

suggest that actual transitions may occur smoothly, without an abrupt shift.
Here we present a new diagnostic tool, based on monitoring the dynamics of

positive feedback, where the transition is abrupt, and systems with negative
density dependence, where the transition is smooth. Analyzing the spatial
dynamics of these two generic scenarios, we show that changes in the critical

fixed number of users (N), these gains diminish as M turns to infinity, and
equal power allocation becomes optimal. A different conclusion is drawn for the
case where both M and N grow large together, in which case: (i) improved rates
are achieved as M grows with fixed M/N ratio, and (ii) the relative gains over
the equal power allocation diminish as M/N grows. Moreover, we also provide
applicable values of M/N under an acceptable power allocation gain threshold,
which can be used as to determine when the proposed power allocation schemes
yield appreciable gains, and when they do not. From the network point of view,
the proposed scheduling approach can achieve almost the same performance as the
joint power allocation after one scheduling round, with much reduced
complexity.

off due to strong centrifugal forces beyond the critical spin period, while the
internal structure does not deform significantly. This paper proposes a
possible structure of an asteroid interior that leads to such surface shedding
due to rapid rotation rates. A rubble pile asteroid is modeled as a spheroid
composed of a surface shell and a concentric internal core, the entire assembly
called the test body. The test body is assumed to be uniformly rotating around
a constant rotation axis. We also assume that while the bulk density and the
friction angle are constant, the cohesion of the surface shell is different
from that of the internal core. First, developing an analytical model based on
limit analysis, we provide the upper and lower bounds for the actual surface
shedding condition. Second, we use a Soft-Sphere Discrete Element Method
(SSDEM) to study dynamical deformation of the test body due to a quasi-static
spin-up. In this paper we show the consistency of both approaches.
Additionally, the SSDEM simulations show that the initial failure always occurs
locally and not globally. In addition, as the core becomes larger, the size of
lofted components becomes smaller. These results imply that if there is a
strong enough core in a progenitor body, surface shedding is the most likely
failure mode.

twenty-seven order of magnitudes. However, they can be linked by imposing the
stability of the electroweak (EW) vacuum. The crucial ingredient is provided by
the generation of neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism triggered by Yukawa
interactions between the standard model (SM) Higgs and lepton doublets and
additional heavy right-handed neutrinos. These neutrinos participate to the
renormalization group (RG) running of the dimensionless SM couplings, affecting
their high-energy behavior. The Higgs quartic coupling is dragged towards
negative values, thus altering the stability of the EW vacuum. In the usual
type-I seesaw model, this effect is too small to be a threat since, in order to
comply with low-energy neutrino data, one is forced to consider either too
small Yukawa couplings or too heavy right-handed neutrinos. In this paper we
explore this general idea in the context of low-scale seesaw models. These
models are characterized by sizable Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrinos
with mass of the order of the EW scale, thus maximizing their impact on the RG
flow. As a general result, we find that Yukawa couplings such that ${\rm
Tr}(Y_{\nu}^{\dag}Y_{\nu}) \gtrsim 0.4$ are excluded. We discuss the impact of
this bound on several observables, with a special focus on the lepton flavor
violating process $\mu\to e\gamma$ and the neutrino-less double beta decay.

constrain this and the other orbital parameters. From tidal considerations, we
find that the companion must be a compact object. This system likely formed
through an exchange encounter in the dense cluster environment. Our initial
timing results predict the measurements of at least two post-Keplerian
parameters with long-term phase-connected timing: the rate of periastron
advance $\dot{\omega} \sim 0.1^{\circ}\,$yr$^{-1}$, requiring 1 yr of phase
connection; and the Einstein delay $\gamma_{\mathrm{GR}} \sim 10\,$ms,
requiring 2-3 yr of timing. For an orbital inclination $i > 50^{\circ}$, a
measurement of $\sin{i}$ is also likely. PSR J1835$-$3259A thus provides an
opportunity to measure the neutron star mass with high precision; to probe the

same frequency. Our real-time search backend, ARTEMIS, utilizes graphics
processing units to search for pulses with dispersion measures up to 320
cm$^{-3}$ pc. Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4~GHz, and
favoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous
detections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs
above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper
limit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$
for 5~ms-duration pulses above 62~Jy. The non-detection could be due to
scatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape
of FRB flux density spectra. Assuming the latter and that FRBs are standard
candles, the non-detection is compatible with the published FRB sky rate, if
their spectra follow a power law with frequency ($\propto \nu^{\alpha}$), with
$\alpha\gtrsim+0.1$, demonstrating a marked difference from pulsar spectra. Our

by restricting attention to the span of Gaussian radial basis functions and
imposing structural assumptions on the transition kernel of the stochastic
processes as well as the target and safe sets of the reach-avoid problem. In
particular, we require the kernel to be written as a Gaussian mixture density
with each mean of the distribution being affine in the current state and input
and the target and safe sets to be written as intersections of quadratic
inequalities. Taking advantage of these structural assumptions, we formulate a
recursion of semidefinite programs where each step provides an upper bound to
the value function of the reach- avoid problem. The upper bounds provide a
performance metric to which any suboptimal control policy can be compared, and
can themselves be used to construct suboptimal control policies. We illustrate
via numerical examples that even if the resulting bounds are conservative, the
associated control policies achieve higher reach-avoid probabilities than
heuristic controllers for problems of large state-input space dimensions (more
than 20). The results presented in this paper, far exceed the limits of current

spheroidal harmonics (SWSHs) through super-symmetric quantum mechanics. We use
the shape invariance property to solve the spin-weighted spheroidal wave
equations. The result shows the relation among SWSHs with a special condition
of the same parameter magnetic quantum number m but different spin-weight s.
The conclusions can be reduced to the famous recurrence relations of
spin-weighted spherical harmonics. These contents are the first investigation
of this kind recurrence relation concerning SWSHs and make it possible to
derive SWSHs from the spheroidal harmonics, so they are very important both in
theoretical background and in the astrophysical applications. Keywords:
spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, recurrence relation, super-symmetric
quantum mechanics, shape-invariance

EU grant number 642795 and runs from January 2015 to December 2018. WDAqua aims
at advancing the state of the art by intertwining training, research and
innovation efforts, centered around one service: data-driven question
answering. Question answering is immediately useful to a wide audience of end
users, and we will demonstrate this in settings including e-commerce, public
sector information, publishing and smart cities. Question answering also covers
web science and data science broadly, leading to transferrable research results
and to transferrable skills of the researchers who have finished our training
programme. To ensure that our research improves question answering overall,
every individual research project connects at least two of these steps.
Intersectional secondments (within a consortium covering academia, research
institutes and industrial research as well as network-wide workshops, R and D
challenges and innovation projects further balance ground-breaking research and
the needs of society and industry. Training-wise these offers equip early stage
researchers with the expertise and transferable technical and non-technical
skills that will allow them to pursue a successful career as an academic,
decision maker, practitioner or entrepreneur.

of its endemic problems, namely stagnation in local optima and lack of
convergence in high dimensionality problems. Since its inception in 1990, there
are multiple articles that have contributed greatly to the development and
improvement of the coevolutionary techniques. In this report we review some of
those landmark articles dwelving in the techniques they propose and how they

and compared to conventional DBP. A 112 Gb/s PM-QPSK signal is transmitted over
a 3200 km dispersion-unmanaged link. The intradyne coherent receiver includes
single-step digital backpropagation based on the enhanced-SSFM algorithm. In
comparison, conventional DBP requires twenty steps to achieve the same
performance. An analysis of the computational complexity and structure of the
two algorithms reveals that the overall complexity and power consumption of DBP
are reduced by a factor of 16 with respect to a conventional implementation,
while the computation time is reduced by a factor of 20. As a result, the
proposed algorithm enables a practical and effective implementation of DBP in
real-time optical receivers, with only a moderate increase of the computational
complexity, power consumption, and latency with respect to a simple
feed-forward equalizer for dispersion compensation.

evolutionary algorithm techniques used to address multimodal optimization
problems, classifying them according to the nature of their approach. On the
one hand there are algorithms that address the issue of the early convergence
to a local optimum by differentiating the individuals of the population into
groups and limiting their interaction, hence having each group evolve with a
high degree of independence. On the other hand other approaches are based on
directly addressing the lack of genetic diversity of the population by
introducing elements into the evolutionary dynamics that promote new niches of
the genotypical space to be explored. Finally, we study multi-objective
optimization genetic algorithms, that handle the situations where multiple
criteria have to be satisfied with no penalty for any of them. Very rich
literature has arised over the years on these topics, and we aim at offering an
overview of the most important techniques of each branch of the field.

  Application to Network Traffic Flow Data",,,,,"cs.NI cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a variety of applications, one desires to detect groups of anomalous data
samples, with a group potentially manifesting its atypicality (relative to a
reference model) on a low-dimensional subset of the full measured set of
features. Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be
strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly
detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset
of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is
unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this
work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify the subset
of samples and subset of features that jointly specify an anomalous cluster. We
apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect BotNet and
peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and
exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features.
Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our
proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency
structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in
previous studies.
