concept, dynamical systems theory and relative entropy analysis to develop a
theory of entropy issues. We introduce two hypotheses concerning the structure
and types properties of the system's entities interactions and derive
generalized replicator dynamic equations. Then we construct energy-like and
entropy-like Lyapunov-Meyer functions (LMF) for these equations. We show that
energy-like LMF contains no information about the equilibrium of the system and
is a substantial generalization of the Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural
selection. If there are exists nontrivial equilibrium point for generalized
replicator system then we construct entropy-like LMF for this system and prove
that it is a relative entropy function or the function of information
divergence. We prove that negative relative entropy is a convex function for a
probability space and receive new distance measure between two probability
distributions. Also we use Legendre-Donkin-Fenchel transformation for dual
coordinates. As result we establish the set of next important links: nonlinear
pairwise interaction - generalized Fisher (replicator) equations -
Lyapunov-Meyer functions - relative entropy - distance measure -
LDF-transformation - duality. In particular it follows from these links that
nonlinear pairwise interaction is the origin of all known entropy functions.

the chiral limit the two masses are expected to determine the quasiparticle
dispersion relation. Analyzing two-point functions of the axial charge density

relation and the residue of the pion pole are simultaneously consistent with
the lattice data at low momentum. The test, based on fits to the correlation

using properties of the numerical radius the criterion itself resembles the one
from algebraic stability of General Linear Methods. Known numerical algorithms
for the computation of the unknown weight matrices suffer from rank
deficiencies of the test matrix. For $s$-stage peer methods of order $s-1$ this

performance with respect to adaptive Metropolis on non-Gaussian targets. This

On a 2d lattice, active particles undergo a diffusion biased in one of two

direction of motion, hence yielding a minimal flocking model with discrete
rotational symmetry. We show that the transition to collective motion amounts
in this model to a bona fide liquid-gas phase transition in the canonical

critical point at zero velocity which belongs to the Ising universality class.
In the density/temperature ""canonical"" ensemble, the usual critical point of
the equilibrium liquid-gas transition is sent to infinite density because the
different symmetries between liquid and gas phases preclude a supercritical
region. We build a continuum theory which reproduces qualitatively the behavior

crucial components of popular e-commerce services. In practice, CFRSs are also
particularly vulnerable to ""shilling"" attacks or ""profile injection"" attacks
due to their openness. The attackers can carefully inject chosen attack
profiles into CFRSs in order to bias the recommendation results to their
benefits. To reduce this risk, various detection techniques have been proposed
to detect such attacks, which use diverse features extracted from user
profiles. However, relying on limited features to improve the detection
performance is difficult seemingly, since the existing features can not fully
characterize the attack profiles and genuine profiles. In this paper, we
propose a novel detection method to make recommender systems resistant to the
""shilling"" attacks or ""profile injection"" attacks. The existing features can be
briefly summarized as two aspects including rating behavior based and item
distribution based. We firstly formulate the problem as finding a mapping model
between rating behavior and item distribution by exploiting the least-squares

one site in the unit cell is Kondo screened while the remaining two are coupled
antiferromagnetically. At even lower fillings the system crosses over from a

by $(e^{2\pi i/3}I,-I,e^{\pi i/3})\in G$, that acts trivially on all the fields

definiteness condition for the Higgs field due to the polar decomposition. This
solves several stringent problems, that we will shortly review, both in the
perturbative and non-perturbative formulations. We will show that the usual
polar decomposition of the complex scalar doublet $\Phi$ should be done with
$U\in SU(2)/Z_2\simeq SO(3)$, where $Z_2$ is the group generated by $-I$, and
with the Higgs field $\phi\in R$ rather than $\phi\in R_{\geq0}$. As a
byproduct, the investigation shows how Elitzur theorem may be avoided in the
usual formulation of the SM. It follows that the simplest lagrangian density
for the Higgs mechanism has the standard kinetic term in addition to the mass
term, with the right sign, and to a linear term in $\phi$. The other model
concerns the scalar theories with normal ordered exponential interactions. The
remarkable property of these theories is that for $D>2$ the purely scalar

often composed of geographically distributed smaller subsystems, we address the
problem of verifying their controllability in a distributed manner. In this
work we study controllability in the structural system theoretic sense,
structural controllability. In other words, instead of focusing on a specific
numerical system realization, we provide guarantees for equivalence classes of
linear time-invariant systems on the basis of their structural sparsity
patterns, i.e., location of zero/nonzero entries in the plant matrices. To this
end, we first propose several necessary and/or sufficient conditions to ensure
structural controllability of the overall system, on the basis of the
structural patterns of the subsystems and their interconnections. The proposed
verification criteria are shown to be efficiently implementable (i.e., with
polynomial time complexity in the number of the state variables and inputs) in
two important subclasses of interconnected dynamical systems: similar (i.e.,
every subsystem has the same structure), and serial (i.e., every subsystem
outputs to at most one other subsystem). Secondly, we provide a distributed
algorithm to verify structural controllability for interconnected dynamical
systems. The proposed distributed algorithm is efficient and implementable at
the subsystem level; the algorithm is iterative, based on communication among
(physically) interconnected subsystems, and requires only local model and
interconnection knowledge at each subsystem.

  David Soudry at Tel Aviv University, submitted January 2013",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Rankin-Selberg method for studying Langlands' automorphic $L$-functions
is to find integral representations, involving certain Fourier coefficients of
cusp forms and Eisenstein series, for these functions. In this thesis we
develop the local theory for generic representations of special orthogonal
groups. We study the local integrals for $SO_{2l}\times GL_{n}$, where
$SO_{2l}$ is the special even orthogonal group, either split or quasi-split,
over a local non-Archimedean field. These integrals admit a functional
equation, which is used to define a $\gamma$-factor. We show that, as expected,
the $\gamma$-factor is identical with Shahidi's $\gamma$-factor. The analytic
properties of the integrals are condensed into a notion of a greatest common
divisor (g.c.d.). We establish certain bounds on the g.c.d. and relate it to
the $L$-function defined by Shahidi in several cases, thereby providing another
point of view on the $L$-function, linking it to the poles of the integrals. In
particular, in the tempered case under a reasonable assumption the g.c.d. is
equal to the $L$-function. Finally, this study includes the computation of the
integrals with unramified data. This work may lead to new applications of the
descent method, as well as aid in analyzing the poles of the global
$L$-function.

even the form of the universal potential in the canonical $1$ matrix model,
follow from general HST considerations. We note that 't Hooft's ansatz for the
leading contribution to the black hole S-matrix, accounts for the entire
S-matrix in these models in the limit that the string scale coincides with the
Planck scale, up to transformations between near horizon and asymptotic
coordinates. These $1 + 1$ dimensional models are describable as decoupling
limits of the near horizon geometry of higher dimensional extremal black holes
or black branes, and this suggests that deformations of the simplest model are
equally physical. After proposing a notion of ""relevant deformations"", we
describe deformations, which contain excitations corresponding to linear
dilaton black holes, some of which can be considered as UV completions of the
CGHS model. We study the question of whether the AMPS paradox can be formulated
in those models. It cannot, because the classical in-fall time to the
singularity of linear dilaton black holes, is independent of the black hole
mass. This result is reproduced by our HST models. We argue that it is related
to the absence of quasi-normal modes of these black hole solutions, which is
itself related to the fact that the horizon has zero area. This is compatible
with the resolution of the AMPS paradox proposed in previous work with
Fischler, according to which the compatibility conditions of HST identify the
long non-singular sojourn of observers behind the horizon, with the dynamics of
equilibration on the horizon as seen by a detector which has not yet fallen

and describe how the location of the singularity 0, be it in the interior of

two settings by considering the optimal Hardy, Sobolev, and the
Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities. The latter rewrites:
$C(\int_{\Omega}\frac{u^{p}}{|x|^s}dx)^{\frac{2}{p}}\leq \int_{\Omega} |\nabla

regarding the explicit values of the optimal constant C, as well as the
existence of non-trivial extremals attached to these inequalities. Scale
invariance properties lead to situations where the best constants do not depend
on the domain and are not attainable. We consider two different approaches to
""break the homogeneity"" of the problem:
  One approach was initiated by Brezis-Nirenberg and by Janelli. It is suitable
for the case where 0 is in the interior of \Omega, and consists of considering
lower order perturbations of the critical nonlinearity. The other approach was
initiated by Ghoussoub-Kang , C.S. Lin et al. and Ghoussoub-Robert. It consists
of considering domains where the singularity is on the boundary.
  Both of these approaches are rich in structure and in challenging problems.
If 0\in \Omega, a negative linear perturbation suffices for higher dimensions,
while a positive ""Hardy-singular interior mass"" is required in lower
dimensions. If the singularity is on the boundary, then the local geometry
around 0 plays a crucial role in high dimensions, while a positive

families of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two
fundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the
correspondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and
the Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity
and determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the
superconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the
superexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These
principles explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to
be such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic
environment. The robust s-wave pairing also reveals that the current standard
effective models with only onsite interactions are not sufficient and a minimum
microscopic model must include strong nearest neighbor repulsive interactions
resulted from the d-d direct bondings to serves as a s-wave symmetry
stabilizer. Finally, the sign distribution of the superconducting order
parameters in the reciprocal space is simply a consequence of the form factors
given by the leading short-range pairings. The sign change of superconducting
order parameters on Fermi surfaces is not a necessary requirement in
repulsive-interaction-driven high T_c mechanism. The results will guide us to
search for new electronic structure that supports high T_c superconductivity.

generic compact binaries is derived for the first time via the effective field
theory for gravitating spinning objects in the post-Newtonian scheme. The
spin-squared sector is an intricate one, as it requires the consideration of
the point particle action beyond minimal coupling, and mainly involves the
spin-squared worldline couplings, which are quite complex, compared to the
worldline couplings from the minimal coupling part of the action. This sector
also involves the linear in spin couplings, as we go up in the nonlinearity of
the interaction, and in the loop order. Hence, there is an excessive increase
in the number of Feynman diagrams, of which more are higher loop ones. We
provide all the Feynman diagrams and their values. The beneficial
nonrelativistic gravitational fields are employed in the computation. This
spin-squared correction, which enters at the fourth post-Newtonian order for
rapidly rotating compact objects, completes the conservative sector up to the
fourth post-Newtonian accuracy. The robustness of the effective field theory
for gravitating spinning objects is shown here once again, as demonstrated in a
recent series of papers by the authors, which obtained all spin dependent
sectors, required up to the fourth post-Newtonian accuracy. The effective field
theory of spinning objects allows to directly obtain the equations of motion,
and the Hamiltonians, and these will be derived for the potential obtained here
in a forthcoming paper.

that the NLR gas is much more perturbed in radio-loud than in radio-quiet

be highly disturbed, and this might be a consequence of interaction with the
relativistic jet. The less frequently perturbed NLR in radio-quiet NLS1s
suggests instead that these sources likely do not harbor a fully developed

determining the metal content of the most distant galaxies has proven so far
almost impossible; also, absorption line experiments at $z\sim6$ become
increasingly difficult because of instrumental limitations and the paucity of
background quasars. With the advent of ALMA, far-infrared emission lines
provide a novel tool to study early metal enrichment. Among these, the [CII]
line at 157.74 $\mu$m is the most luminous line emitted by the interstellar
medium of galaxies. It can also resonant scatter CMB photons inducing
characteristic intensity fluctuations ($\Delta I/I_{CMB}$) near the peak of the
CMB spectrum, thus allowing to probe the low-density IGM. We compute both [CII]
galaxy emission and metal-induced CMB fluctuations at $z\sim 6$ by using
Adaptive Mesh Refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and produce
mock observations to be directly compared with ALMA BAND6 data ($\nu_{obs}\sim

$\log(F_{peak}/\mu{\rm Jy})=-27.205-2.253\,M_{UV}-0.038\,M_{UV}^2$. Such
relation is in very good agreement with recent ALMA observations (e.g. Maiolino

$M_{UV}=-19$ ($M_{UV}=-18$) galaxy can be detected at $4\sigma$ in $\simeq40$

0.1\,\mu$Jy/beam emission/absorptions features that are very challenging to be
detected with current facilities. The best strategy to detect these signals
consists in the stacking of deep ALMA observations pointing fields with known
$M_{UV}\simeq-19$ galaxies. This would allow to simultaneously detect both

With suitable software, such telescopes could be electronically connected and
also used for intensity interferometry. Second-order spatial coherence of light
is obtained by cross correlating intensity fluctuations measured in different
pairs of telescopes. With no optical links between them, the error budget is
set by the electronic time resolution of a few nanoseconds. Corresponding
light-travel distances are approximately one meter, making the method
practically immune to atmospheric turbulence or optical imperfections,
permitting both very long baselines and observing at short optical wavelengths.
Previous theoretical modeling has shown that full images should be possible to
retrieve from observations with such telescope arrays. This project aims at
verifying diffraction-limited imaging experimentally with groups of detached
and independent optical telescopes. In a large optics laboratory, artificial
stars were observed by an array of small telescopes. Using high-speed
photon-counting solid-state detectors, intensity fluctuations were
cross-correlated over up to 180 baselines between pairs of telescopes,
producing coherence maps across the interferometric Fourier-transform plane.
These measurements were used to extract parameters about the simulated stars,
and to reconstruct their two-dimensional images. As far as we are aware, these
are the first diffraction-limited images obtained from an optical array only
linked by electronic software, with no optical connections between the

near the critical region. At the standard mean-field theory (s-MFT) level, in a
region of the parameter space of this Hamiltonian that we refer to as
$\Gamma_5$ region, the ordered state possesses an accidental $U(1)$ degeneracy.
In this paper, we show that fluctuations beyond s-MFT lift this degeneracy by
selecting one of two states (so-called $\psi_2$ and $\psi_3$) from the
degenerate manifold, thus exposing a certain form of order-by-disorder (ObD).
We analytically explore this selection at the microscopic level and close to
criticality by elaborating upon and using an extension of the so-called TAP
method, originally developed by Thouless, Anderson and Palmer to study the
effect of fluctuations in spin glasses. We also use a single-tetrahedron
cluster-mean-field theory (c-MFT) to explore over what minimal length scale
fluctuations can lift the degeneracy. We find the phase diagrams obtained by
these two methods to be somewhat different since c-MFT only includes the
shortest-range fluctuations. General symmetry arguments used to construct a
Ginzburg-Landau theory to lowest order in the order parameters predict that a
weak magnetic moment, $m_z$, along the local $\langle 111 \rangle$ (${\hat z}$)
direction is generically induced for a system ordering into a $\psi_2$ state,
but not so for $\psi_3$ ordering. Both E-TAP and c-MFT calculations confirm
this weak fluctuation-induced $m_z$ moment. Using a Ginzburg-Landau theory, we
discuss the phenomenology of multiple phase transitions below the paramagnetic
phase transition and within the $\Gamma_5$ long-range ordered phase.

Most
of these events are thought to be explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs
(WDs), but for many of the explosion scenarios, particularly those involving
the externally triggered detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD (sub-M Ch
WD), there is also a possibility of having an oxygen-neon (ONe) WD as
progenitor. We simulate detonations of ONe WDs and calculate synthetic
observables from these models. The results are compared with detonations in CO
WDs of similar mass and observational data of SNe Ia. We perform hydrodynamic
explosion simulations of detonations in initially hydrostatic ONe WDs for a
range of masses below the Chandrasekhar mass (M Ch), followed by detailed
nucleosynthetic postprocessing with a 384-isotope nuclear reaction network. The
results are used to calculate synthetic spectra and light curves, which are
then compared with observations of SNe Ia. We also perform binary evolution
calculations to determine the number of SNe Ia involving ONe WDs relative to
the number of other promising progenitor channels. The ejecta structures of our
simulated detonations in sub-M Ch ONe WDs are similar to those from CO WDs.
There are, however, small systematic deviations in the mass fractions and the
ejecta velocities. These lead to spectral features that are systematically less
blueshifted. Nevertheless, the synthetic observables of our ONe WD explosions
are similar to those obtained from CO models. Our binary evolution calculations
show that a significant fraction (3-10%) of potential progenitor systems should
contain an ONe WD. The comparison of our ONe models with our CO models of

galaxies, observed with the SAURON integral field unit, using the full-spectrum
fitting method. We show that star formation histories (SFHs) resolved into two
populations can be recovered even within a limited wavelength range, provided
that high S/N data is used. We confirm that dEs have had complex SFHs, with
star formation extending to (more) recent epochs: for the majority of our
galaxies star formation activity was either still strong a few ($\lesssim$ 5)
Gyr ago or they experienced a secondary burst of star formation roughly at that
time. This latter possibility is in agreement with the proposed dE formation
scenario where tidal harassment drives the gas remaining in their progenitors
inwards and induces a star formation episode. For one of our field galaxies,
ID0918, we find a correlation between its stellar population and kinematic
properties, pointing to a possible merger origin of its kinematically-decoupled
core. One of our cluster objects, VCC1431, appears to be composed exclusively
of an old population ($\gtrsim$ 10-12 Gyr). Combining this with our earlier
dynamical results, we conclude that the galaxy was either ram-pressure stripped
early on in its evolution in a group environment and subsequently tidally
heated, or that it evolved in situ in the cluster's central parts, compact
enough to avoid tidal disruption. These are only two of the examples
illustrating the SFH richness of these objects confirmed with our data.

crucially important to correctly extract cosmological information from redshift
surveys. The task is complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift space
distortion effects, which change with halo mass, and by the wide distribution
of halo masses and their occupations by galaxies. One of the main modeling
challenges is the existence of satellite galaxies that have both radial
distribution and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon known as
the Finger-of-God effect. We present a model for the galaxy power spectrum of
in which we decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxies
and relate different contributions to 1- and 2-halo terms in a halo model. Our
primary goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have physically
meaningful values, and are not just fitting parameters. For the 2-halo terms we
use the previously developed RSD modeling of halos in the context of
distribution function and perturbation theory approach. This term needs to be
multiplied by the effect of radial distances and velocities of satellites
inside the halo. To this one needs to add the 1-halo terms, which are
non-perturbative. We show that the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled as
almost constant, with the finite extent of the satellites inside the halo
inducing a small k^2R^2 term, where R is related to the size of the halo. We
adopt a similar model for FoG in redshift space, ensuring that FoG velocity
dispersion is related to the halo mass. For FoG k^2 type expansions do not work
and FoG resummation must be used instead. We test several damping functions to
model the velocity dispersion FoG effect. Applying the formalism to mock
galaxies modeled after the ""CMASS"" sample of the BOSS survey, we find that our
predictions for the redshift-space power spectra are accurate up to k~0.4Mpc/h.

plasma waves -- sub-wavelength charge density oscillations connected with
electromagnetic fields that are tightly localized near the surface[1,2]. When
these waves are confined to finite-sized graphene, plasmon resonances emerge
that are characterized by alternating charge accumulation at the opposing edges
of the graphene. The resonant frequency of such a structure depends on both the
size and the surface charge density, and can be electrically tuned throughout
the terahertz range by applying a gate voltage[3,4]. The promise of tunable
graphene THz plasmonics has yet to be fulfilled, however, because most proposed
optoelectronic devices including detectors, filters, and modulators[5-10]
desire near total modulation of the absorption or transmission, and require
electrical contacts to the graphene -- constraints that are difficult to meet
using existing plasmonic structures. We report here a new class of plasmon
resonance that occurs in a hybrid graphene-metal structure. The sub-wavelength
metal contacts form a capacitive grid for accumulating charge, while the narrow
interleaved graphene channels, to first order, serves as a tunable inductive
medium, thereby forming a structure that is resonantly-matched to an incident
terahertz wave. We experimentally demonstrate resonant absorption near the
theoretical maximum in readily-available, large-area graphene, ideal for THz
detectors and tunable absorbers. We further predict that the use of high
mobility graphene will allow resonant THz transmission near 100%, realizing a
tunable THz filter or modulator. The structure is strongly coupled to incident
THz radiation, and solves a fundamental problem of how to incorporate a tunable
plasmonic channel into a device with electrical contacts.

analysis of communication systems, especially in real time applications for
which delay is critical. In this work, we analyse the completion time of data
dissemination in a shared loss (i.e., unreliable links) multicast tree, at the
limit of large number of nodes. Specifically, analytic expressions for upper
and lower bounds on the expected completion time are provided, and, in
particular, it is shown that both these bounds scale as $\alpha \log n$. For
example, on a full binary tree with $n$ end users, and packet loss probability
of $0.1$, we bound the expected completion time for disseminating one packet

  Clearly, the completion time is determined by the last end user who receives
the message, that is, a maximum over all arrival times. Hence, Extreme Value
Theory (EVT) is an appropriate tool to explore this problem. However, since
arrival times are correlated, non-stationary, and furthermore, time slots are
discrete, a thorough study of EVT for Non-Stationary Integer Valued (NSIV)
sequences is required. To the best of our knowledge, such processes were not
studied before in the framework of EVT. Consequently, we derive the asymptotic
distribution of the maxima of NSIV sequences satisfying certain conditions, and
give EVT results which are applicable also beyond the scope of this work. These
result are then used to derive tight bounds on the completion time. Finally,
the results are validated by extensive simulations and numerical analysis.

challenging problem, especially using model-free approaches. Most techniques,
such as nearest-neighbor prediction, quickly suffer from the curse of
dimensionality and overfitting for more than a few predictors which has limited
their application mostly to the univariate case. Therefore, selection
strategies are needed that harness the available information as efficiently as
possible. Since often the right combination of predictors matters, ideally all
subsets of possible predictors should be tested for their predictive power, but
the exponentially growing number of combinations makes such an approach
computationally prohibitive. Here a prediction scheme that overcomes this
strong limitation is introduced utilizing a causal pre-selection step which
drastically reduces the number of possible predictors to the most predictive
set of causal drivers making a globally optimal search scheme tractable. The
information-theoretic optimality is derived and practical selection criteria
are discussed. As demonstrated for multivariate nonlinear stochastic delay
processes, the optimal scheme can even be less computationally expensive than
commonly used sub-optimal schemes like forward selection. The method suggests a
general framework to apply the optimal model-free approach to select variables
and subsequently fit a model to further improve a prediction or learn
statistical dependencies. The performance of this framework is illustrated on a
climatological index of El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation.

Coifman-Meyer type theorem for operator-valued multilinear multipliers acting
on suitable tuples of UMD spaces. A concrete case of our theorem is a

leading to a novel mixed norm version of the partial fractional Leibniz rules
of Muscalu et. al.. Our approach works just as well for the more singular
tensor products of a one-parameter Coifman-Meyer multiplier with a bilinear
Hilbert transform, extending results of Silva.
  We also prove several operator-valued $T (1)$-type theorems both in one
parameter, and of multi-para\-meter, mixed-norm type. A distinguishing feature
of our $T(1)$ theorems is that the usual explicit assumptions on the
distributional kernel of $T$ are replaced with testing-type conditions. Our
proofs rely on a newly developed Banach-valued version of the outer $L^p$ space

stochastic forcing. There are also surprises in the dynamical complexity of the
attractors that can robustly appear - for example, heteroclinic network

obtained at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The quest for a sound
understanding of the dynamics behind MPI - particularly at this time when the
LHC is due to start its ""Run II"" operations - has focused the aim of this
workshop. MPI@LHC2014 concentrated mainly on the phenomenology of LHC
measurements whilst keeping in perspective those results obtained at previous
hadron colliders. The workshop has also debated some of the state-of-the-art
theoretical considerations and the modeling of MPI in Monte Carlo event
generators. The topics debated in the workshop included: Phenomenology of MPI
processes and multiparton distributions; Considerations for the description of
MPI in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD); Measuring multiple partonic interactions;
Experimental results on inelastic hadronic collisions: underlying event,
minimum bias, forward energy flow; Monte Carlo generator development and
tuning; Connections with low-x phenomena, diffraction, heavy-ion physics and
cosmic rays. In a total of 57 plenary talks the workshop covered a wide range
of experimental results, Monte Carlo development and tuning, phenomenology and
dedicated measurements of MPI which were produced with data from the LHC's Run
I. Recent progress of theoretical understanding of MPI in pp, pA and AA
collisions as well as the role of MPI in diffraction and small-x physics were
also covered. The workshop forstered close contact between the experimental and
theoretical communities. It provided a setting to discuss many of the different
aspects of MPI, eventually identifying them as a unifying concept between
apparently different lines of research and evaluating their impact on the LHC
physics programme.

tunneling, and ARPES as probes of isolated out-of-equilibrium quantum systems,
and examine the crucial role played by the nonequilibrium distribution
function. As an example, we focus on the induced topological time-periodic
(Floquet) phase in a 2D $p+ip$ superfluid, following an instantaneous quench of
the coupling strength. The post-quench Cooper pairs occupy a linear combination
of ""ground"" and ""excited"" Floquet states, with coefficients determined by the
distribution function. While the Floquet bandstructure exhibits a single
avoided crossing relative to the equilibrium case, the distribution function
shows a population inversion of the Floquet bands at low energies. For a
realization in ultracold atoms, these two features compensate, producing a bulk
average rf signal that is well-captured by a quasi-equilibrium approximation.
In particular, the rf spectrum shows a robust gap. The single crossing occurs
because the quench-induced Floquet phase belongs to a particular class of
soliton dynamics for the BCS equation. The population inversion is a
consequence of this, and ensures the conservation of the pseudospin winding
number. As a comparison, we compute the rf signal when only the lower Floquet
band is occupied; in this case, the gap disappears for strong quenches. The
tunneling signal in a solid state realization is ignorant of the distribution
function, and can show wildly different behaviors. We also examine rf,
tunneling, and ARPES for weak quenches, such that the resulting topological
steady-state is characterized by a constant nonequilibrium order parameter. In
a system with a boundary, tunneling reveals the Majorana edge states. However,
the local rf signal due to the edge states is suppressed by a factor of the
inverse system size, and is spatially deconfined throughout the bulk of the
sample.

the existence of infinitely many Lipschitz solutions to certain

density condition. Finally, we study two important cases of forward-backward
anisotropic diffusion in which the density condition can be realized and
therefore the existence results follow together with micro-oscillatory behavior

It dynamically resolves longstanding issues such as fast dimension five
operator mediated proton decay in Susy GUTs by allowing explicit and complete
calculation of crucial threshold effects at $M_{Susy}$ and $M_{GUT}$ in terms
of fundamental parameters. This shows that SO(10) Yukawas responsible for
observed fermion masses as well as operator dimension 5 mediated proton decay
can be highly suppressed on a ""Higgs dissolution edge"" in the parameter space
of GUTs with rich superheavy spectra. This novel and generically relevant
result highlights the need for every realistic UV completion model with a
large/infinite number of heavy fields coupled to the light Higgs doublets to
explicitly account for the large wave function renormalization effects on
emergent light Higgs fields in order to be considered a quantitatively well
defined candidate UV completion. The NMSGUT predicts large soft Susy breaking
trilinear couplings and distinctive sparticle spectra. Measurable or near
measurable level of tensor perturbations- and thus large Inflaton mass scale-
may be accommodated by Supersymetric Seesaw inflation within the NMSGUT based
on an LHN flat direction Inflaton if the Higgs component contains contributions

automorphisms, for example in proofs of homological stability in [8,9] and in
the proof that Out$(F_n)$ is a virtual duality group in [1]. More recently, in
[5], their cohomology $H^i(\Gamma_{n,s})$, over a field of characteristic zero,
was computed in ranks $n=1, 2$ giving new constructions of unstable homology
classes of $\mbox{Out}(F_n)$ and $\mbox{Aut}(F_n)$. In this paper we show that,
for fixed $i$ and $n$, this cohomology $H^i(\Gamma_{n,s})$ forms a finitely
generated FI-module of stability degree $n$ and weight $i$, as defined by
Church-Ellenberg-Farb in [2]. We thus recover that for all $i$ and $n$, the
sequences $\{H^i(\Gamma_{n,s})\}_{s\geq0}$ satisfy representation stability,
but with an improved stable range of $s \geq i+n$ which agrees with the low
dimensional calculations made in [5]. Another important consequence of this
FI-module structure is the existence of character polynomials which determine
the character of the $\mathfrak{S}_s$-module $H^i(\Gamma_{n,s})$ for all $s
\geq i+n$. In particular this implies that, for fixed $i$ and $n$, the
dimension of $H^i(\Gamma_{n,s})$, is given by a polynomial in $s$ for all
$s\geq i+n$. We compute explicit examples of such character polynomials to
demonstrate this phenomenon.

observed the cone-shaped wavefront of TIDs that is interpreted as a ballistic
acoustic wave. The typical TIDs propagation velocity were observed
661+/-256m/s, which corresponds to the expected acoustic wave speed for 240km
height. 14 minutes after the bolide explosion, at distances of 200km we
observed the emergence and propagation of a TID with spherical wavefront, that
is interpreted as gravitational mode of internal acoustic waves. The
propagation velocity of this TID was 337+/-89m/s which corresponds to the
propagation velocity of these waves in similar situations. At EKB SuperDARN
radar, we observed TIDs in the sector of azimuthal angles close to the
perpendicular to the meteorite trajectory. The observed TID velocity (400 m/s)
and azimuthal properties correlate well with the model of ballistic wave
propagating at 120-140km altitude.
  It is shown, that the azimuthal distribution of the amplitude of vertical
seismic oscillations can be described qualitatively by the model of vertical
strike-slip rupture, propagating at 1km/s along the meteorite fall trajectory
to distance of about 40km. These parameters correspond to the direction and
velocity of propagation of the ballistic wave peak by the ground. It is shown,
that the model of ballistic wave caused by supersonic motion and burning of the
meteorite in the upper atmosphere can satisfactorily explain the various
azimuthal ionospheric effects, observed by the coherent decameter radar EKB
SuperDARN, GPS-receivers network, as well as the azimuthal characteristics of

  Tracking Problem",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the practical business environment, portfolio managers often face
business-driven requirements that limit the number of constituents in their
tracking portfolio. A natural index tracking model is thus to minimize a
tracking error measure while enforcing an upper bound on the number of assets
in the portfolio. In this paper we consider such a cardinality-constrained
index tracking model. In particular, we propose an efficient nonmonotone
projected gradient (NPG) method for solving this problem. At each iteration,
this method usually solves several projected gradient subproblems. We show that
each subproblem has a closed-form solution, which can be computed in linear
time. Under some suitable assumptions, we establish that any accumulation point
of the sequence generated by the NPG method is a local minimizer of the
cardinality-constrained index tracking problem. We also conduct empirical tests
to compare our method with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm and the hybrid
half thresholding algorithm \cite{L1/2} for index tracking. The computational
results demonstrate that our approach generally produces sparse portfolios with
smaller out-of-sample tracking error and higher consistency between in-sample
and out-of-sample tracking errors. Moreover, our method outperforms the other
two approaches in terms of speed.

successfully applied in mean-variance portfolio selection for promoting
out-of-sample properties and decreasing transaction costs. However, $L_1$
regularization approach is ineffective in promoting sparsity and selecting
regularization parameter on index tracking with the budget and no-short selling
constraints, since the 1-norm of the asset weights will have a constant value
of one. Our recent research on $L_{1/2}$ regularization has found that the half
thresholding algorithm with optimal regularization parameter setting strategy
is the fast solver of $L_{1/2}$ regularization, which can provide the more
sparse solution. In this paper we apply $L_{1/2}$ regularization method to
stock index tracking and establish a new sparse index tracking model. A hybrid
half thresholding algorithm is proposed for solving the model. Empirical tests
of model and algorithm are carried out on the eight data sets from OR-library.
The optimal tracking portfolio obtained from the new model and algorithm has
lower out-of-sample prediction error and consistency both in-sample and
out-of-sample. Moreover, since the automatic regularization parameters are
selected for the fixed number of optimal portfolio, our algorithm is a fast
solver, especially for the large scale problem.

that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large
conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite
optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to converse well. It
is able extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a
large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a
domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a
technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript
dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As
expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of
our model.

in changes to the proton Dirac form factor induced by the nuclear medium. Such
a dramatic quenching of the Coulomb sum rule was not seen in a recent quantum

Shared cosmological parameters, such as $\sigma_8$, need not be the same for
optimal fits to observational data. We choose to set our parameters to
$\Lambda$CDM $z=0$ values. We find that in coupled models, where DM decays into
DE, haloes appear remarkably similar to $\Lambda$CDM haloes despite DM
experiencing an additional frictional force. Density profiles are not
systematically different and the subhalo populations have similar mass, spin,
and spatial distributions, although (sub)haloes are less concentrated on
average in coupled cosmologies. However, given the scatter in related
observables ($V_{\rm max},R_{V_{\rm max}}$), this difference is unlikely to
distinguish between coupled and uncoupled DM. Observations of satellites of MW
and M31 indicate a significant subpopulation reside in a plane. Coupled models
do produce planar arrangements of satellites of higher statistical significance
than $\Lambda$CDM models, however, in all models these planes are dynamically
unstable. In general, the nonlinear dynamics within and near large haloes masks
the effects of a coupled dark sector. The sole environmental signature we find
is that small haloes residing in the outskirts are more deficient in baryons
than their $\Lambda$CDM counterparts. The lack of a pronounced signal for a

school in Chamb{\'e}ry in June 2015. We consider general semilinear PDE's and
we address the following two questions: 1) How to design an efficient feedback
control locally stabilizing the equation asymptotically to 0? 2) How to
construct such a stabilizing feedback from approximation schemes? To address
these issues, we distinguish between parabolic and hyperbolic semilinear PDE's.
By parabolic, we mean that the linear operator underlying the system generates
an analytic semi-group. By hyperbolic, we mean that this operator is
skew-adjoint. We first recall general results allowing one to consider the
nonlinear term as a perturbation that can be absorbed when one is able to
construct a Lyapunov function for the linear part. We recall in particular some
known results borrowed from the Riccati theory. However, since the numerical
implementation of Riccati operators is computationally demanding, we focus then
on the question of being able to design ""simple"" feedbacks. For parabolic
equations, we describe a method consisting of designing a stabilizing feedback,
based on a small finite-dimensional (spectral) approximation of the whole
system. For hyperbolic equations, we focus on simple linear or nonlinear
feedbacks and we investigate the question of obtaining sharp decay results.
When considering discretization schemes, the decay obtained in the continuous
model cannot in general be preserved for the discrete model, and we address the
question of adding appropriate viscosity terms in the numerical scheme, in
order to recover a uniform decay. We consider space, time and then full
discretizations and we report in particular on the most recent results obtained
in the literature. Finally, we describe several open problems and issues.

ionizing star as B0.5 V and the radial velocity of the star to be -17.5(1.4)
km/s. This value is consistent with the velocity of gas in a wide field across
the S233 region, suggesting that the ionizing star was formed from a parent
cloud belonging to the S233 region. By studying spatial-kinematic structure of
the molecular cloud in the S233 region, we detected an isolated clump of gas
producing CO emission red-shifted relative to the parent cloud. In the UKIDSS
and WISE images, the clump of gas coincides with the infrared source containing
a compact object and bright-rimmed structure. The bright-rimmed structure is
perpendicular to the direction of the ionizing star. The compact source
coincides in position with IRAS source 05351+3549. All these features indicate
a possibility of triggering formation of a next-generation star in the S233

that the ""collect-and-collapse"" process is not likely to take place in the S233

accretion column are expected to produce shock quasi-oscillations with a
maximum amplitude reaching ~ 40% in the bremsstrahlung (0.5-10 keV) X-ray

imposes an upper limit of ~ (5-10) g.cm-2.s-1 on the specific accretion rate

the amplitudes and frequencies of the observed optical QPOs. This contradiction
outlines probable shortcomings with the shock instability model.

Hades was adapted to simulate this specific accretion phenomena. Classical
approaches were used to model the radiative losses of the two main radiative
processes: bremsstrahlung and cyclotron. The oscillation frequencies and
amplitudes in the X-ray and optical domains are studied to compare those
numerical results to observational ones. Different dimensional formulae were
developed to complete the numerical evaluations. The complete characterization
of the emitting region is described for the two main radiative regimes: when
only the bremsstrahlung losses and when both cyclotron and bremsstrahlung
losses are considered. The effect of the non-linear cooling in- stability
regime on the accretion column behaviour is analysed. Variation in luminosity
on short timescales (~ 1 s quasi-periodic oscillations) is an expected
consequence of this specific dynamic. The importance of secondary shock
instability on the quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenon is discussed. The

greater efficiency over their classical counterparts in solving various

  One of such algorithms is the quantum phase estimation algorithm which

adjacency matrices of networks for the pairwise alignment. We also present a
greedy quantum measurement scheme to efficiently procure the alignment from the

flowing on an inclined plane. The turbulent transport of momentum and density
can be described in a very direct and compact form by a Prandtl mixing length
model: the turbulent vertical fluxes of momentum and density are found to scale
quadratically with the vertical mean gradients of velocity and density. The
scaling coefficient, the square of the mixing length, is approximately constant
over the mixing zone of the stratified shear layer. We show how, in different
flow configurations, this length can be related to the shear length of the flow
($\epsilon$/$\partial$ z u^3)^1/2. We also study the fluctuations of the
momentum and density turbulent fluxes, showing how they relate to mixing and to
the entrainment/detrainment balance. We suggest a quantitative measure of local
entrainment and detrainment derived from observed conditional correlations of
density flux and density or vertical velocity fluctuations.

potential barriers. We consider two types of the SLs: the SLs with uniform and
nonuniform gap. Using the perturbative approach we obtain an analytical
expression for the inverse localization length (ILL) derived for the case of
randomly fluctuating geometric and energetic parameters. In the first case,
when the barrier (well) width fluctuates around its mean value, the
corresponding equation for the ILL reveals the presence of the Fabry-Perot
resonances, at which the localization length diverges. These resonances are
exact, i.e., are stored in any degree of disorder. It has been found that the
localization properties manifest stronger for the particles with energies lying
in the non-resonant bands where our approach is extremely sensitive to the
degree of disorder. For the case of weakly fluctuating both barrier and well
widths we analytically obtain ILL taking correlations into account. The main
effect of the correlations, which lead to an increase (or decrease) in the
localization length, was revealed near the double resonance arising at
coincidence of two Fabry-Perot resonances associated with barrier and well
widths. The random fluctuations of the potential strength also lead to the
delocalization resonances. However, they exist only in a weak-disorder
approximation. We found that, for an array composed of alternating strips of
gapless and gapped graphene modifications these resonances can appear only for
normally incident particles in contrast to the SL with a uniform gap. For such
particles, the delocalization resonances occur also in the purely random
potential. This means, in particular, that in the one-dimensional case, not all

systems, namely underlay and overlay based cognitive WPCNs, depending on
different types of knowledge on the primary user transmission available at the
cognitive WPCN. For each model, we maximize the sum-throughput of the cognitive
WPCN by optimizing its transmission under different constraints applied to
protect the primary user transmission. Analysis and simulation results are
provided to compare the sum-throughput of the cognitive WPCN versus the
achievable rate of the primary user in two coexisting models. It is shown that
the overlay based cognitive WPCN outperforms the underlay based counterpart,
thanks to its fully cooperative WET/WIT design with the primary WIT, while it
also requires higher complexity for implementation.

We compute in particular the gravitational mass ($M$), equatorial ($R_{\rm

moment of inertia ($I$) and quadrupole moment ($M_2$) of neutron stars stable
against mass-shedding and secular axisymmetric instability. By constructing the
constant frequency sequence $f=716$ Hz of the fastest observed pulsar, PSR
J1748-2446ad, and constraining it to be within the stability region, we obtain
a lower mass bound for the pulsar, $M_{\rm min}=[1.2$-$1.4] M_\odot$, for the
EOS employed. Moreover we give a fitting formula relating the baryonic mass
($M_b$) and gravitational mass of non-rotating neutron stars,
$M_b/M_\odot=M/M_\odot+(13/200)(M/M_\odot)^2$ [or
$M/M_\odot=M_b/M_\odot-(1/20)(M_b/M_\odot)^2$], which is independent on the
EOS. We also obtain a fitting formula, although not EOS independent, relating
the gravitational mass and the angular momentum of neutron stars along the
secular axisymmetric instability line for each EOS. We compute the maximum
value of the dimensionless angular momentum, $a/M\equiv c J/(G M^2)$ (or ""Kerr
parameter""), $(a/M)_{\rm max}\approx 0.7$, found to be also independent on the
EOS. We compare and contrast then the quadrupole moment of rotating neutron
stars with the one predicted by the Kerr exterior solution for the same values
of mass and angular momentum. Finally we show that, although the mass
quadrupole moment of realistic neutron stars never reaches the Kerr value, the
latter is closely approached from above at the maximum mass value, as
physically expected from the no-hair theorem. In particular the stiffer the EOS
is, the closer the Kerr solution is approached.

the important details that may define an artist's style. In recent years high
resolution images of artworks have become available, which, combined with
increased processing power and new computational techniques, allow us to
analyse digital images of artworks at a very fine scale. In this work we train
and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the task of artist
attribution using artwork images of varying resolutions. To this end, we
combine two existing methods to enable the application of high resolution
images to CNNs. By comparing the attribution performances obtained at different
scales, we find that in most cases finer scales are beneficial to the
attribution performance, whereas for a minority of the artists, coarser scales
appear to be preferable. We conclude that artist attribution would benefit from
a multi-scale CNN approach which vastly expands the possibilities for
computational art forensics.

  and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2015)",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding how crossover works is still one of the big challenges in
evolutionary computation research, and making our understanding precise and
proven by mathematical means might be an even bigger one. As one of few
examples where crossover provably is useful, the $(1+(\lambda, \lambda))$
Genetic Algorithm (GA) was proposed recently in [Doerr, Doerr, Ebel: TCS 2015].
Using the fitness level method, the expected optimization time on general
OneMax functions was analyzed and a $O(\max\{n\log(n)/\lambda, \lambda n\})$
bound was proven for any offspring population size $\lambda \in [1..n]$.
  We improve this work in several ways, leading to sharper bounds and a better
understanding of how the use of crossover speeds up the runtime in this
algorithm. We first improve the upper bound on the runtime to
$O(\max\{n\log(n)/\lambda, n\lambda \log\log(\lambda)/\log(\lambda)\})$. This
improvement is made possible from observing that in the parallel generation of
$\lambda$ offspring via crossover (but not mutation), the best of these often
is better than the expected value, and hence several fitness levels can be
gained in one iteration.
  We then present the first lower bound for this problem. It matches our upper
bound for all values of $\lambda$. This allows to determine the asymptotically
optimal value for the population size. It is $\lambda =
\Theta(\sqrt{\log(n)\log\log(n)/\log\log\log(n)})$, which gives an optimization
time of $\Theta(n \sqrt{\log(n)\log\log\log(n)/\log\log(n)})$. Hence the
improved runtime analysis gives a better runtime guarantee along with a better
suggestion for the parameter $\lambda$.
  We finally give a tail bound for the upper tail of the runtime distribution,
which shows that the actual runtime exceeds our runtime guarantee by a factor
of $(1+\delta)$ with probability $O((n/\lambda^2)^{-\delta})$ only.

transient offset events and magnetic field signal that occurred at the

conventionally interpreted as a signature of piezomagnetic effects, however
could not be ascribed as such. The reason is that the presently known geology
of the LAquila basin consists mainly of carbonates, dolomites and limestone,
thus it does not suggest an appearance of piezomagnetic related effects under
EQ fracture/slip events. The second type of coseismic event, the transient
magnetic signal starts simultaneously with the offset event and reaches
amplitude of 0.8 nT in the total magnetic field. The signal is local one, in
the sense that its form differs from the signals of ionospheric/magnetospheric
origin confirmed (indirectly) by additional magnetic field data in Italy and
Central Europe. The reliability of the observed local signal is examined also:
it follows from the fact that the transient signal is recorded by two different
measurements: i) in components (by fluxgate magnetometers) and 2) absolute one
(overhauser magnetometer), it persists after the seismic wave train passage but
within the first five minutes after the EQ shock and is not a consequence of
ionosphere disturbances caused by the seismic wave train. Its amplitude shape
resembles diffusion-like form with time scale characteristics that are
indicative for a source deep in the crust. The polarity of the transient signal
is in the horizontal plane and nearly parallel to the LAquila fault strike,
i.e. along the NW-SE direction.

recovering scene depth and extending the depth-of-field. The ideal pattern,
however, would have to serve two conflicting purposes: 1) be broadband to
ensure robust deconvolution and 2) has sufficient zero-crossings for a high
depth discrepancy. This paper presents a simple but effective scene-adaptive
coded aperture solution to bridge this gap. We observe that the geometric
structures in a natural scene often exhibit only a few edge directions, and the
successive frames are closely correlated. Therefore we adopt a spatial
partitioning and temporal propagation scheme. In each frame, we address one
principal direction by applying depth-discriminative codes along it and
broadband codes along its orthogonal direction. Since within a frame only the
regions with edge direction corresponding to its aperture code behaves well, we
utilize the close among-frame correlation to propagate the high quality single
frame results temporally to obtain high performance over the whole image
lattice. To physically implement this scheme, we use a Liquid Crystal on
Silicon (LCoS) microdisplay that permits fast changing pattern codes. Firstly,
we capture the scene with a pinhole and analyze the scene content to determine
primary edge orientations. Secondly, we sequentially apply the proposed coding
scheme with these orientations in the following frames. Experiments on both

performance similar to previously reported devices on dedicated manufacturing
processes. The average figures measured are insertion loss 5 dB, loss
non-uniformity 3 dB, polarization dependent loss 0.6 dB, polarization dependent
wavelength shift of 0.3 nm, with reduced footprint. The performance comparison
between multiplexers with and without metal mirrors, for both polarizations, is
provided. Several dies were measured, and the passband features for the
multiplexers are analyzed, giving a reference on the process variations for
future designers.

(PNPF) model for studying ion transport through biological ion channels. PNPF
contains many more correlations than most models and simulations of channels,
because it includes water and calculates dielectric properties consistently as
outputs. This model accounts for the steric effect of ions and water molecules
with different sizes and interstitial voids, the correlation effect of crowded
ions with different valences, and the screening effect of polarized water
molecules in an inhomogeneous aqueous electrolyte. The steric energy is shown
to be comparable to the electrical energy under physiological conditions,
demonstrating the crucial role of the excluded volume of particles and the
voids in the natural function of channel proteins. Water is shown to play a
critical role in both correlation and steric effects in the model. We extend
the classical Scharfetter-Gummel (SG) method for semiconductor devices to
include the steric potential for ion channels, which is a fundamental physical
property not present in semiconductors. Together with a simplified matched
interface and boundary (SMIB) method for treating molecular surfaces and
singular charges of channel proteins, the extended SG method is shown to
exhibit important features in flow simulations such as optimal convergence,
efficient nonlinear iterations, and physical conservation. Two different
methods --- called the SMIB and multiscale methods --- are proposed for two
different types of channels, namely, the gramicidin A channel and an L-type
calcium channel, depending on whether water is allowed to pass through the
channel. The PNPF currents are in accord with the experimental I-V (V for
applied voltages) data of the gramicidin A channel and I-C (C for bath
concentrations) data of the calcium channel.

explore this in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking with

namely, octet of color SU(3) and triplet of weak SU(2). A distinctive feature
of this scenario is that the focus point is achieved by fixing a single

renormalization group evolution. Because of this invariance, the focus point
behavior is well under control once the relevant parameters are fixed by a more
fundamental theory. The observed Higgs boson mass is explained with a
relatively mild fine-tuning $\Delta=$ 60-150. Interestingly, even in the
presence of incomplete messenger multiplets of the SU(5) GUT group, the gauge
couplings still unify perfectly, but at a scale which is one or two orders of
magnitude above the conventional GUT scale. Because of this larger unification
scale, the colored Higgs multiplets become too heavy to trigger proton decay at

declination, inclination and intensity of the magnetic field from
archeomagnetic data. Adopting a Bayesian perspective, we need to specify a
priori knowledge about the time evolution of the magnetic field. It consists in
a time correlation function that we choose to be compatible with present
knowledge about the geomagnetic time spectra. The results are presented as
distributions of possible values for the declination, inclination or intensity.
We find that the methodology can be adapted to account for the age
uncertainties of archeological artefacts and we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to
explore the possible dates of observations. We apply the method to intensity
datasets from Mari, Syria and to intensity and directional datasets from Paris,
France. Our reconstructions display more rapid variations than previous studies
and we find that the possible values of geomagnetic field elements are not
necessarily normally distributed. Another output of the model is better age
estimates of archeological artefacts.

applying the Wilson-Devinney code. With a hot spot placed on the massive
primary component near the neck region of the common envelope, the light curves
were satisfactorily modeled. The photometric solution combined with the radial
velocity solution reveals that XZ Leo is an A-type contact binary with a degree
of contact of 24($\pm1)\%$. The absolute parameters of the components were
determined as M_1 = 1.74($\pm$0.06)M_\odot, M_2 = 0.61($\pm$0.02)M_\odot, R_1 =

long-term orbital period behavior of the system was investigated. It indicates
that the binary system was undergoing continuous orbital period increase in the
past three decades with a rate of dP/dt = + 6.12 \times {10^{-8}} days yr^{-1},
which suggests a probable mass transfer from the secondary to the primary

Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2013) from SDSS-III/BOSS, complemented by Planck
2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and other cosmological probes. This
paper improves on the previous analysis by Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2015)
by using a more powerful set of calibrating hydrodynamical simulations that
reduces uncertainties associated with resolution and box size, by adopting a
more flexible set of nuisance parameters for describing the evolution of the
intergalactic medium, by including additional freedom to account for systematic
uncertainties, and by using Planck 2015 constraints in place of Planck 2013.
  Fitting Ly$\alpha$ data alone leads to cosmological parameters in excellent
agreement with the values derived independently from CMB data, except for a
weak tension on the scalar index $n_s$. Combining BOSS Ly$\alpha$ with Planck
CMB constrains the sum of neutrino masses to $\sum m_\nu < 0.12$ eV (95\% C.L.)
including all identified systematic uncertainties, tighter than our previous
limit (0.15 eV) and more robust. Adding Ly$\alpha$ data to CMB data reduces the
uncertainties on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$, through the
correlation of $\tau$ with $\sigma_8$. Similarly, correlations between
cosmological parameters help in constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio of
primordial fluctuations $r$. The tension on $n_s$ can be accommodated by
allowing for a running ${\mathrm d}n_s/{\mathrm d}\ln k$. Allowing running as a
free parameter in the fits does not change the limit on $\sum m_\nu$. We
discuss possible interpretations of these results in the context of slow-roll
inflation.

According to this model, once the central black hole accretes at the Eddington
limit and reaches a certain critical mass, AGN driven outflows blow out gas,
suppressing star formation in the host galaxy and self-regulating black hole
growth. We consider a sample of 224 quasars selected from the SDSS at z<1
observed in the infrared band by Herschel. We evaluate the star formation rate
in relation to several outflow signatures traced by the [OIII]4959,5007 and
[OII]3726,3729 emission lines in about half of the sample with high quality
spectra. Most of the quasars show asymmetric and broad wings in [OIII], which
we interpret as outflow signatures. We separate the quasars in two groups,
``weakly'' and ``strongly'' outflowing, using three different criteria. When we
compare the mean star formation rate in five redshift bins in the two groups,
we find that the SFRs are comparable or slightly larger in the strongly
outflowing quasars. We estimate the stellar mass from SED fitting and the
quasars are distributed along the star formation main sequence, although with a
large scatter. The scatter from this relation is uncorrelated with respect to
the kinematic properties of the outflow. Moreover, for quasars dominated in the
infrared by starburst or by AGN emission, we do not find any correlation
between the star formation rate and the velocity of the outflow, a trend
previously reported in the literature for pure starburst galaxies. We conclude
that the basic AGN negative feedback scenario seems not to agree with our
results. Although we use a large sample of quasars, we did not find any
evidence that the star formation rate is suppressed in the presence of AGN
driven outflows on large scale. A possibility is that feedback is effective
over much longer timescales than those of single episodes of quasar activity.

strategies of a utility-maximizing retiree facing a stochastic time of death
under a variety of institutional restrictions. We focus on the impact of aging
on the optimal purchase of life annuities which form the basis of most Defined
Benefit pension plans. Due to adverse selection, acquiring a lifetime payout
annuity is an irreversible transaction that creates an incentive to delay.
Under the institutional all-or-nothing arrangement where annuitization must
take place at one distinct point in time (i.e. retirement), we derive the
optimal age at which to annuitize and develop a metric to capture the loss from
annuitizing prematurely. In contrast, under an open-market structure where
individuals can annuitize any fraction of their wealth at anytime, we locate a
general optimal annuity purchasing policy. In this case, we find that an
individual will initially annuitize a lump sum and then buy annuities to keep
wealth to one side of a separating ray in wealth-annuity space. We believe our
paper is the first to integrate life annuity products into the portfolio choice
literature while taking into account realistic institutional restrictions which
are unique to the market for mortality-contingent claims.

Lipschitz maps from a metric space to a Banach space, inspired by the classical
theory that relates ideals of operators and tensor norms for Banach spaces, by
using the Lipschitz tensor products previously introduced by the same authors.
We first study spaces of Lipschitz maps, from a metric space to a dual Banach
space, that can be represented canonically as the dual of a Lipschitz tensor
product endowed with a Lipschitz cross-norm. We show that several known
examples of ideals of Lipschitz maps (Lipschitz maps, Lipschitz $p$-summing
maps and maps admitting a Lipschitz factorization through a subset of an $L_p$
space) admit such a representation, and more generally we characterize when a
space of Lipschitz maps from a metric space to a dual Banach space is in
canonical duality with a Lipschitz cross-norm. Furthermore, we give conditions
on the Lipschitz cross-norm that are almost equivalent to the space of
Lipschitz maps having an ideal property. We introduce a concept of operators
which are approximable with respect to one of these ideals of Lipschitz maps,
and identify them in terms of tensor-product notions. Finally, we also prove a
Lipschitz version of the representation theorem for maximal operator ideals.
This allows us to relate Lipschitz cross-norms to ideals of Lipschitz maps
taking values in general Banach spaces, and not just dual spaces.

times lower than the value of primordial Li predicted by the standard Big Bang
nucleosynthesis when the baryon density is taken from the CMB or the deuterium
measurements. This disagreement is generally referred as the lithium problem.
We here reconsider the stellar Li evolution from the pre-main sequence to the
end of the main sequence phase by introducing the effects of convective
overshooting and residual mass accretion. We show that $^7$Li could be
significantly depleted by convective overshooting in the pre-main sequence
phase and then partially restored in the stellar atmosphere by a tail of matter
accretion which follows the Li depletion phase and that could be regulated by
EUV photo-evaporation. By considering the conventional nuclear burning and
microscopic diffusion along the main sequence we can reproduce the Spite
plateau for stars with initial mass $m_0=0.62 - 0.80 M_{\odot}$, and the Li
declining branch for lower mass dwarfs, e.g, $m_0=0.57 - 0.60 M_{\odot}$, for a
wide range of metallicities (Z=0.00001 to Z=0.0005), starting from an initial
Li abundance $A({\rm Li}) =2.72$. This environmental Li evolution model also
offers the possibility to interpret the decrease of Li abundance in extremely

the valence of the rare earth element are reflected in the experimental
electronic band structure primarily as a rigid shift of the energy position of
the metal 5$\textit{d}$ states with respect to the Fermi level. Although the
overall shape of the $\textit{d}$-derived Fermi surface contours remains the
same, we report differences in the dimensionality of these states between the
compounds studied. Moreover, the spectroscopic fingerprint of the 4$\textit{f}$
states also reveals considerable differences that are related to their
coherence and the strength of the $\textit{d}$-$\textit{f}$ hybridization. For

perpendicular to the simulation box, and we add a spectrum of large-scale
magnetic and kinetic fluctuations, with energy equipartition and vanishing
correlation. Once the turbulence is fully developed, we observe a MHD inertial
range, where the spectra of the perpendicular magnetic field and the
perpendicular proton bulk velocity fluctuations exhibit power-law scaling with
spectral indices of -5/3 and -3/2, respectively. This behavior is extended over
a full decade in wavevectors and is very stable in time. A transition is
observed around proton scales. At sub-ion scales, both spectra steepen, with
the former still following a power law with a spectral index of ~-3. A -2.8
slope is observed in the density and parallel magnetic fluctuations,
highlighting the presence of compressive effects at kinetic scales. The
spectrum of the perpendicular electric fluctuations follows that of the proton
bulk velocity at MHD scales, and flattens at small scales. All these features,
which we carefully tested against variations of many parameters, are in good
agreement with solar wind observations. The turbulent cascade leads to on
overall proton energization with similar heating rates in the parallel and
perpendicular directions. While the parallel proton heating is found to be
independent on the resistivity, the number of particles per cell and the
resolution employed, the perpendicular proton temperature strongly depends on

particular challenges, in particular the requirement to operate at extremely
cold temperatures, to cope with rapid temperature fluctuations and to prevent
frosting. Heating of electronic subsystems is a necessity, but solutions must
be found to avoid the turbulence induced by temperature fluctua- tions on the
optical paths. ASTEP 400 is a 40 cm Newton telescope installed at the Concordia
station, Dome C since 2010 for photometric observations of fields of stars and
their exoplanets. While the telescope is designed to spread star light on
several pixels to maximize photometric stability, we show that it is
nonetheless sensitive to the extreme variations of the seeing at the ground
level (between about 0.1 and 5 arcsec) and to temperature fluctuations between
--30 degrees C and --80 degrees C. We analyze both day-time and night-time
observations and obtain the magnitude of the seeing caused by the mirrors, dome
and camera. The most important effect arises from the heating of the primary
mirror which gives rise to a mirror seeing of 0.23 arcsec K--1 . We propose
solutions to mitigate these effects.

the IEEE 802.11 protocol in broadcast mode with waiting queues. In contrast to
existing models, packets arriving when a station (or node) is in back-off state
are not discarded, but are stored in a buffer of infinite capacity. As in
previous studies, the key point of our analysis hinges on the assumption that
the time on the channel is viewed as a random succession of transmission slots
(whose duration corresponds to the length of a packet) and mini-slots during
which the back-o? of the station is decremented. These events occur
independently, with given probabilities. The state of a node is represented by
a two-dimensional Markov chain in discrete-time, formed by the back-off counter
and the number of packets at the station. Two models are proposed both of which
are shown to cope reasonably well with the physical principles of the protocol.
The stabillity (ergodicity) conditions are obtained and interpreted in terms of
maximum throughput. Several approximations related to these models are also
discussed.

the control are usually more difficult to study than the the ones when the
delay appears only in the state. This is particularly true when we look at the
associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Indeed, even in the
simplified setting (introduced first by Vinter and Kwong for the deterministic
case) the HJB equation is an infinite dimensional second order semilinear
Partial Differential Equation (PDE) that does not satisfy the so-called
""structure condition"" which substantially means that ""the noise enters the
system with the control."" The absence of such condition, together with the lack
of smoothing properties which is a common feature of problems with delay,
prevents the use of the known techniques (based on Backward Stochastic
Differential Equations (BSDEs) or on the smoothing properties of the linear
part) to prove the existence of regular solutions of this HJB equation and so
no results on this direction have been proved till now.
  In this paper we provide a result on existence of regular solutions of such
kind of HJB equations and we use it to solve completely the corresponding
control problem finding optimal feedback controls also in the more difficult
case of pointwise delay. The main tool used is a partial smoothing property
that we prove for the transition semigroup associated to the uncontrolled
problem. Such results holds for a specific class of equations and data which
arises naturally in many applied problems.

understanding how is the contribution and weight of each of those angular

torque cancels the usually called intrinsic torque which was often considered
responsible of the particle spinning. In addition, I obtain the contribution of
the spatial structure of the wave to this torque, unknown to this date, showing
its effect in the orbiting of the object, and demonstrating that it often leads
to a negative torque on a single particle, i.e. opposite to the incident
helicity, producing an orbital motion contrary to its spinning. Furthermore, I
establish a decomposition of the electromagnetic torque into conservative and
non-conservative components in which the helicity and its flow play a role
analogous to the energy and its flux for electromagnetic forces. I illustrate
these phenomena with examples of beams, also showing the difficulties of some
paraxial formulations whose fields do not hold the transversality condition.

the minimal number of operations in the decompositions of the automaton into
indecomposable components (atoms). This theory relies on the following
parallelism between wreath and triangular products: both of them are terminal

product is the terminal object in the Krohn-Rhodes theory for pure automata,

A
particularly puzzling and up-to-now unexplained feature of the Kuiper belt is
the so-called `kernel', a concentration of orbits with semimajor axes a~44 AU,
eccentricities e~0.05, and inclinations i<5 deg. Here we show that the Kuiper
belt kernel can be explained if Neptune's otherwise smooth migration was
interrupted by a discontinuous change of Neptune's semimajor axis when Neptune
reached ~28 AU. Before the discontinuity happened, planetesimals located at ~40
AU were swept into Neptune's 2:1 resonance, and were carried with the migrating
resonance outwards. The 2:1 resonance was at ~44 AU when Neptune reached ~28
AU. If Neptune's semimajor axis changed by fraction of AU at this point,
perhaps because Neptune was scattered off of another planet, the 2:1 population
would have been released at ~44 AU, and would remain there to this day. We show
that the orbital distribution of bodies produced in this model provides a good
match to the orbital properties of the kernel. If Neptune migration was
conveniently slow after the jump, the sweeping 2:1 resonance would deplete the
population of bodies at ~45-47 AU, thus contributing to the paucity of the
low-inclination orbits in this region. Special provisions, probably related to
inefficiencies in the accretional growth of sizable objects, are still needed
to explain why only a few low-inclination bodies have been so far detected
beyond ~47 AU.

hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues
typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to
adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social
network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they
require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the
individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional
contagion using Twitter. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null
model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of
emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are
exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a
negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than
baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50%
more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship
between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and
that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of
individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly
susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions
than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive
emotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much
greater than that of negative emotions.

Analogous
to superconductors, this quantum state may support transport without
dissipation. Recent works suggest that longitudinal spin transport through a
thin-film ferromagnet is an example of spin superfluidity. Although intriguing,
this tantalizing picture ignores long-range dipole interactions; we demonstrate
that such interactions dramatically affect spin transport. In single-film
ferromagnets, ""spin superfluidity"" only exists at length scales (a few hundred
nanometers in yttrium iron garnet) somewhat larger than the exchange length.
Over longer distances, dipolar interactions destroy spin superfluidity.
Nevertheless, we predict re-emergence of spin superfluidity in tri-layer
ferromagnet--normal metal--ferromagnet films of $\sim 1\, \mu$m in size. Such
systems also exhibit other types of long-range spin transport in samples
several micrometers in size.

electron-electron collisions is the shortest length scale in the problem. In
this regime, transport is described by the Navier-Stokes equation, which
contains two fundamental parameters, the bulk and shear viscosities. In this
Article we present extensive results for these transport coefficients in the
case of the two-dimensional massless Dirac fermion liquid in a doped graphene
sheet. Our approach relies on microscopic calculations of the viscosities up to
second order in the strength of electron-electron interactions and in the
high-frequency limit, where perturbation theory is applicable. We then use
simple interpolation formulae that allow to reach the low-frequency
hydrodynamic regime where perturbation theory is no longer directly applicable.
The key ingredient for the interpolation formulae is the ""viscosity transport
time"" $\tau_{\rm v}$, which we calculate in this Article. The transverse nature
of the excitations contributing to $\tau_{\rm v}$ leads to the suppression of
scattering events with small momentum transfer, which are inherently
longitudinal. Therefore, contrary to the quasiparticle lifetime, which goes as
$-1/[T^2 \ln(T/T_{\rm F})]$, in the low temperature limit we find $\tau_{\rm v}
\sim 1/T^2$.

efficient, the STF2 approximation to compact binary inspiral employs
approximate kinematics (e.g., a single spin) and an approximate waveform (e.g.,

magnetic field strength, different HM detection material, and YIG thickness
ranging from nm to mm. A large enhancement of the SSE signal is observed at low
temperatures leading to a peak of the signal amplitude. We demonstrate that
this enhancement shows a clear dependence on the film thickness, being more
pronounced for thicker films and vanishing for films thinner than 600 nm. The
peak temperature depends on the applied magnetic field strength as well as on
the detection material and interface, revealing a more complex behavior beyond
the currently discussed phonon-magnon coupling mechanism that considers only
bulk effects. While the thickness dependence and magnetic field dependence can
be well explained in the framework of the magnon-driven SSE by taking into
account the frequency dependent propagation length of thermally excited magnons
in the bulk material, the temperature dependence of the SSE is significantly
influenced by the interface coupling to an adjacent detection layer. This
indicates that previously neglected interface effects play a key role and that
the spin current traversing the interface and being detected in the HM depends
differently on the magnon frequency for different HMs.

singularity in shear traction is then predicted, with a stress-intensity factor
that is proportional to the the square root of the local contact pressure and
to a certain integral of the friction coefficient-slip distance relation. We
can also define an equivalent of the `small-scale yielding' criterion, which

stars satisfy certain relations which are almost insensitive to the star's
internal structure. A natural question is whether the same relations hold for
different compact objects and how they possibly approach the black-hole limit.
Here we consider ""gravastars"", which are hypothetical compact objects sustained
by their internal vacuum energy. Such solutions have been proposed as exotic
alternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black
holes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell
gravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia
$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\lambda$ in
exact form. The $I$-$\lambda$-$Q$ relations of a gravastar are dramatically
different from those of an ordinary compact star, but the black-hole limit is
continuous, i.e. these quantities approach their Kerr counterparts when the
compactness is maximum. Therefore, such relations can be used to discern a
gravastar from an ordinary compact star, but not to break the degeneracy with
the black-hole case. Based on these results, we conjecture that the full
multipolar structure and the tidal deformability of a spinning, ultracompact
gravastar are identical to those of a Kerr black hole. The approach to the
black-hole limit is nonpolynomial, thus differing from the critical behavior
recently found for strongly anisotropic neutron stars.

with high precision in order to be able to detect deviations from Gaussianity.
The computation is carried out on the lattice with high statistics Monte Carlo
simulations by implementing a naive discretization of the topological charge
evolved with the Yang--Mills gradient flow. This definition is far less
demanding than the one suggested from Neuberger's fermions and, as shown in
this paper, in the continuum limit its cumulants coincide with those of the
universal definition appearing in the chiral Ward identities. Thanks to the
range of lattice volumes and spacings considered, we can extrapolate the
results for the second and fourth cumulant of the topological charge
distribution to the continuum limit with confidence by keeping finite volume
effects negligible with respect to the statistical errors. Our best results for
the topological susceptibility is t_0^2*chi=6.67(7)*10^-4, where t_0 is a
standard reference scale, while for the ratio of the forth cumulant over the
second we obtain R=0.233(45). The latter is compatible with the expectations
from the large Nc expansion, while it rules out the theta-behavior of the
vacuum energy predicted by the dilute instanton model. Its large distance from
1 implies that, in the ensemble of gauge configurations that dominate the path
integral, the fluctuations of the topological charge are of quantum
non-perturbative nature.

of the near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between two parallel plates.
We show that when the plates are made of doped semiconductors, the near-field
thermal radiation can be severely affected by the application of a static
magnetic field. We find that irrespective of its direction, the presence of a
magnetic field reduces the radiative heat conductance, and dramatic reductions
up to 700% can be found with fields of about 6 T at room temperature. We show
that this striking behavior is due to the fact that the magnetic field
radically changes the nature of the NFRHT. The field not only affects the
electromagnetic surface waves (both plasmons and phonon polaritons) that
normally dominate the near-field radiation in doped semiconductors, but it also
induces hyperbolic modes that progressively dominate the heat transfer as the
field increases. In particular, we show that when the field is perpendicular to
the plates, the semiconductors become ideal hyperbolic near-field emitters.
More importantly, by changing the magnetic field, the system can be
continuously tuned from a situation where the surface waves dominate the heat
transfer to a situation where hyperbolic modes completely govern the near-field
thermal radiation. We show that this high tunability can be achieved with
accessible magnetic fields and very common materials like n-doped InSb or Si.
Our study paves the way for an active control of NFRHT and it opens the
possibility to study unique hyperbolic thermal emitters without the need to
resort to complicated metamaterials.

the classical heavy particle as a time-dependent scattering center, allowing to
demonstrate interesting features of these forces when the system is driven out

scattering potential can have a profound impact on a fermionic system due to
the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe. In this work, by calculating the
Loschmidt echo, we relate Anderson orthogonality effects with the mesoscopic

of \phi^4 theory leads to the asymptotics \beta(g)=\beta_\infty g^\alpha at
g\to\infty, where \alpha\approx 1 for space dimensions d=2,3,4. The natural
hypothesis arises, that asymptotic behavior is \beta(g) \sim g for all d.
Consideration of the ""toy"" zero-dimensional model confirms the hypothesis and
reveals the origin of this result: it is related with a zero of a certain
functional integral. This mechanism remains valid for arbitrary space
dimensionality d. The same result for the asymptotics is obtained for
explicitly accepted lattice regularization, while the use of high-temperature
expansions allows to calculate the whole \beta-function. As a result, the
\beta-function of four-dimensional \phi^4 theory is appeared to be
non-alternating and has a linear asymptotics at infinity. The analogous
situation is valid for QED. According to the Bogoliubov and Shirkov
classification, it means possibility to construct the continuous theory with
finite interaction at large distances. This conclusion is in visible
contradiction with the lattice results indicating triviality of \phi^4 theory.
This contradiction is resolved by a special character of renormalizability in
\phi^4 theory: to obtain the continuous renormalized theory, there is no need
to eliminate a lattice from the bare theory. In fact, such kind of
renormalizability is not accidental and can be understood in the framework of
Wilson's many-parameter renormalization group. Application of these ideas to
QCD shows that Wilson's theory of confinement is not purely illustrative, but
has a direct relation to a real situation. As a result, the problem of
analytical proof of confinement and a mass gap can be considered as solved, at
least on the physical level of rigor.

effective potential of the standard model either develops an unstable

latter case in which the top quark mass is about $2\sigma$ below its present
central value, the Higgs boson can be the inflaton with the help of a large
nonminimal coupling to curvature in four dimensions. We propose a scenario in
which the Higgs boson can be the inflaton in a five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet
braneworld model to solve both the unitarity and stability problems which
usually plague Higgs inflation. We find that in order for Higgs inflation to
happen successfully in the Gauss-Bonnet regime, the extra dimension scale must
appear roughly in the range between the TeV scale and the instability scale of
standard model. At the tree level, our model can give rise to a naturally small

the object parameters by fitting data with the model, thereby allowing accurate
reconstruction. As recently proposed and demonstrated, combining pixel
super-resolution techniques with Inverse Problems approaches improves the
estimation of particle size and 3D-position. Here we demonstrate the accurate
tracking of colloidal particles in Brownian motion. Particle size and
3D-position are jointly optimized from video holograms acquired with a digital
holographic microscopy set up based on a ""low-end"" microscope objective

possible to characterize particles with a standard deviation of 15 nm in size

range of effects -- both positive and negative -- on the distribution grid. The

climate, PV penetration level, and other factors. In this paper we present a
simulation study of eight representative distribution feeders in three
California climates at PV penetration levels up to 100\%, supported by a unique
database of distributed PV generation data that enables us to capture the
impact of PV variability on feeder voltage and voltage regulating equipment.
When comparing the influence of feeder location (i.e. climate) versus feeder
type on outcomes, we find that location more strongly influences the incidence
of reverse power flow, reductions in peak loading and the presence of voltage
excursions. On the other hand, we find that feeder characteristics more
strongly influence the magnitude of loss reduction and changes in voltage
regulator operations. We find that secondary distribution transformer aging is
negligibly affected in almost all scenarios.

trade-offs of these multiferroic devices by solving stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the presence of room-temperature thermal

the magnetostrictive nanomagnet that can increase the device density on a chip.
We show that the vertical thickness of the nanomagnet can be increased while
scaling down the lateral area and keeping the assumption of single-domain limit
valid. This has important consequence since it helps to some extent preventing
the deterioration of the induced stress-anisotropy energy in the
magnetostrictive nanomagnet, which is proportional to the nanomagnet's volume.
The results show that if we scale down the lateral area, the switching delay
increases while energy dissipation decreases. Avenues available to decrease the
switching delay while still reducing the energy dissipation are discussed.

expressions from molecular simulations for arbitrary interatomic potentials is
presented. First, pointwise continuum fields are obtained using a
generalization of the Irving-Kirkwood procedure to arbitrary multi-body
potentials. Two ambiguities associated with the original Irving-Kirkwood
procedure (which was limited to pair potential interactions) are addressed in
its generalization. The first ambiguity is due to the non-uniqueness of the
decomposition of the force on an atom as a sum of central forces, which is a
result of the non-uniqueness of the potential energy representation in terms of
distances between the particles. This is in turn related to the shape space of
the system. The second ambiguity is due to the non-uniqueness of the energy
decomposition between particles. The latter can be completely avoided through
an alternate derivation for the energy balance. It is found that the
expressions for the specific internal energy and the heat flux obtained through
the alternate derivation are quite different from the original Irving-Kirkwood
procedure and appear to be more physically reasonable. Next, in the second step
of the unified framework, spatial averaging is applied to the pointwise field
to obtain the corresponding macroscopic quantities. These lead to expressions
suitable for computation in molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that
the important commonly-used microscopic definitions for the stress tensor and
heat flux vector are recovered in this process as special cases (generalized to
arbitrary multi-body potentials). Several numerical experiments are conducted
to compare the new expression for the specific internal energy with the
original one.

First a local solution valid for all values of the disk height is constructed
by piecing together an interior solution obtained numerically with an
analytical exterior radiative solution. The matching is obtained by assuming
hydrostatic balance and radiative equilibrium. Although in principle the
procedure can be carried out in general, it simplifies considerably when the
interior solution is fully convective. In these cases, the construction is
analogous to the derivation of the Hayashi tracks for protostars. The second
step consists of piecing together the local solutions at different radii to
