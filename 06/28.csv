arXiv:1503.05057v1], where the suppression of phase coherence of a
single-electron wave packet created at the edge of a quantum Hall (QH) system
at filling factor 2 has been investigated with the help of an electronic
Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer. The authors of the experiment have observed
an unexpected behavior of phase coherence, that saturates at high energies
instead of vanishing, presumably suggesting the relaxation of a wave packet to
the ground state before it arrives to the MZ interferometer. Here, we
theoretically investigate this situation using the model of edge states [I. P.
Levkivskyi, E. V. Sukhorukov, Phys. Rev. B 78, 045322 (2008)], which accounts
for the strong Coulomb interaction between the two electron channels at the
edge of a QH system. We conclude that the observed phenomenon cannot be
explained within this model for the reason that under an assumption of
linearity of the electron spectrum at low energies the system remains
integrable in terms of the collective charge excitations, and therefore full
relaxation to the ground state is not possible, despite strong interactions. As
a result, the degree of the phase coherence decreases with energy of the
initial state in a power-law manner. Since this does not happen in the
experiment, a new physical phenomenon may take place at the edge of a QH state,
which deserves further investigations. We support our findings by calculating
the energy distribution and the Wigner function of the outgoing non-equilibrium
state of the single-electron wave packet.

the index theory to conclude. The blow-up profile does not scale as
$(T-t)^{1/2}|\log(T-t)|^{1/2},$ like in the standard nonlinear heat equation,

blocked RF links due to body shadowing forward their data through the BCC link

be used for driving the decisions of the previous algorithms. Finally, the
analytical models are used for further optimizing energy and delay efficiency.

transmission range of a macrocell. For the efficient operation of HCNs it is
essential that the high power macrocell shuts off its transmissions for an
appropriate amount of time in order for the low power small cells to transmit.
This is a mechanism that allows time-domain resource partitioning (TDRP) and is
critical to be optimized for maximizing the throughput of the complete HCN. In
this paper, we investigate video communication in HCNs when TDRP is employed.
After defining a detailed system model for video streaming in such a HCN, we
consider the problem of maximizing the experienced video quality at all the
users, by jointly optimizing the TDRP for the HCN, the rate allocated to each
specific user, and the selected video quality transmitted to a user. The
NP-hard problem is solved with a primal-dual approximation algorithm that
decomposes the problem into simpler subproblems, making them amenable to fast
well-known solution algorithms. Consequently, the calculated solution can be
enforced in the time scale of real-life video streaming sessions. This last
observation motivates the enhancement of the proposed framework to support
video delivery with dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH). Our extensive
simulation results demonstrate clearly the need for our holistic approach for
improving the video quality and playback performance of the video streaming
users in HCNs.

the disk. As the existence of the required cavity in the presence of magnetic
fields has been put into doubt by theoretical calculations, we will explore in

that there appears to be no compelling reason to discard g-modes. In

  at Low Bitrates",,,,,"cs.MM cs.CV cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many mobile visual analysis applications, compressed video is transmitted
over a communication network and analyzed by a server. Typical processing steps
performed at the server include keypoint detection, descriptor calculation, and
feature matching. Video compression has been shown to have an adverse effect on
feature-matching performance. The negative impact of compression can be reduced
by using the keypoints extracted from the uncompressed video to calculate
descriptors from the compressed video. Based on this observation, we propose to
provide these keypoints to the server as side information and to extract only
the descriptors from the compressed video. First, we introduce four different
frame types for keypoint encoding to address different types of changes in
video content. These frame types represent a new scene, the same scene, a
slowly changing scene, or a rapidly moving scene and are determined by
comparing features between successive video frames. Then, we propose Intra,
Skip and Inter modes of encoding the keypoints for different frame types. For
example, keypoints for new scenes are encoded using the Intra mode, and
keypoints for unchanged scenes are skipped. As a result, the bitrate of the
side information related to keypoint encoding is significantly reduced.
Finally, we present pairwise matching and image retrieval experiments conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using the Stanford mobile
augmented reality dataset and 720p format videos. The results show that the
proposed approach offers significantly improved feature matching and image
retrieval performance at a given bitrate.

Demaine, Harmon, Iacono, Kane, and Patrascu (DHIKP) to accommodate for

Greedy BST algorithm introduced by DHIKP. Greedy BST is known to be equivalent
to a maximally greedy (but inherently offline) algorithm introduced
independently by Lucas in 1988 and Munro in 2000, conjectured to be dynamically
optimal.
  With the application of forbidden-submatrix theory, we prove a quasilinear
upper bound on the performance of Greedy BST on deque sequences. It has been
conjectured (Tarjan, 1985) that splay trees (Sleator and Tarjan, 1983) can
serve such sequences in linear time. Currently neither splay trees, nor other
general-purpose BST algorithms are known to fulfill this requirement. As a
special case, we show that Greedy BST can serve output-restricted deque
sequences in linear time. A similar result is known for splay trees (Tarjan,
1985; Elmasry, 2004).
  As a further application of the insert-delete model, we give a simple proof
that, given a set U of permutations of [n], the access cost of any BST
algorithm is Omega(log |U| + n) on ""most"" of the permutations from U. In
particular, this implies that the access cost for a random permutation of [n]
is Omega(n log n) with high probability.
  Besides the splay tree noted before, Greedy BST has recently emerged as a
plausible candidate for dynamic optimality. Compared to splay trees, much less
effort has gone into analyzing Greedy BST. Our work is intended as a step
towards a full understanding of Greedy BST, and we remark that
forbidden-submatrix arguments seem particularly well suited for carrying out
this program.

that the transition probability as a function of time instants has a huge

set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated,
would cause the spread of information to the whole network [1]; or, if
immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic [2,3].
Localizing this optimal, i.e. minimal, set of structural nodes, called
influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science [4,5].
Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders
[6-14], the problem remains unsolved. Here, we map the problem onto optimal
percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers,
which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of
the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix [15] of the network.
Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller
than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large
number of previously neglected weakly-connected nodes emerges among the optimal
influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by
hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal
collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. Eventually, the
present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being
applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous
transition from a known phase [16].

with Rashba spin-orbit coupling induces a spin polarization in the
perpendicular direction (Edelstein effect). This phenomenon has been
extensively studied in the linear response regime, i.e., when the average drift
velocity of the electrons is a small fraction of the Fermi velocity. Here we
investigate the phenomenon in the nonlinear regime, meaning that the average
drift velocity is comparable to, or exceeds the Fermi velocity. This regime is
realized when the electric field is very large, or when electron-impurity
scattering is very weak. The quantum kinetic equation for the density matrix of
noninteracting electrons is exactly and analytically solvable, reducing to a
problem of spin dynamics for ""unpaired"" electrons near the Fermi surface. The
crucial parameter is $\gamma=eEL_s/E_F$, where $E$ is the electric field, $e$
is the absolute value of the electron charge, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy, and
$L_s = \hbar/(2m\alpha)$ is the spin-precession length in the Rashba spin-orbit
field with coupling strength $\alpha$. If $\gamma\ll1$ the evolution of the
spin is adiabatic, resulting in a spin polarization that grows monotonically in
time and eventually saturates at the maximum value $n(\alpha/v_F)$, where $n$
is the electron density and $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. If $\gamma \gg 1$ the
evolution of the spin becomes strongly non-adiabatic and the spin polarization
is progressively reduced, and eventually suppressed for $\gamma\to \infty$. We
also predict an inverse nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which an electric
current is driven by a magnetic field that grows linearly in time. The
""conductivities"" for the direct and the inverse effect satisfy generalized
Onsager reciprocity relations, which reduce to the standard ones in the linear
response regime.

star occurs within two different regimes separated by a critical value of the
density of the hadronic phase $\overline{n_h}$. The first stage, occurring for
$n_h>\overline{n_h}$, is characterized by turbulent combustion and lasts
typically a few ms. During this short time-scale neutrino cooling is basically
inactive and the star heats up thanks to the heat released in the conversion.
In the second stage, occurring for $n_h<\overline{n_h}$, turbulence is not
active anymore, and the conversion proceeds on a much longer time scale (of the
order of tens of seconds), with a velocity regulated by the diffusion and the
production of strange quarks. At the same time, neutrino cooling is also
active. The interplay between the heating of the star due to the slow
conversion of its outer layers (with densities smaller than $\overline{n_h}$)
and the neutrino cooling of the forming quark star leads to a quasi-plateau in
the neutrino luminosity which, if observed, would possibly represent a unique
signature for the existence of quark matter inside compact stars. We will
discuss the phenomenological implications of this scenario in particular in
connection with the time structure of long gamma-ray-bursts.

works on this method has so far gained some promising results derived from the
approximating expressions for the power spectra among others, up to second
order with respect to the Hubble and sound flow parameters, when compared to
other semi-analytical approaches (e.g., Green's function and WKB methods).
However, a closer inspection is suggestive that there is a problem when
higher-order parts of the power spectra are considered; residual logarithmic
divergences may come out that can render the prediction physically
inconsistent. Looking at this possibility, we map out up to what order with
respect to the mentioned parameters several physical quantities can be
calculated before hitting a logarithmically divergent result. It turns out that
the power spectra are limited up to second order, the tensor-to-scalar ratio up
to third order, and the spectral indices and running converge to all orders.
This indicates that the expansion scheme is incompatible with the working
equations derived from UA for the power spectra but compatible with that of the
spectral indices. For those quantities that involve logarithmically divergent
terms in the higher-order parts, existing results in the literature for the
convergent lower-order parts calculated in the equivalent fashion should be
viewed with some caution; they do not rest on solid mathematical ground.

determining if $\operatorname{dal}(G) \leq 2$ is NP-complete. We also connect

primary causes of hot-electron-mediated degradation of power devices, which
holds up their commercial development. At the same time, carrier capture is a
major issue in the performance of solar cells and light-emitting diodes. A
theory of nonradiative inelastic scattering by defects, however, is
non-existent, while the the- ory for carrier capture by defects has had a long
and arduous history. Here we report the construction of a comprehensive theory
of inelastic scattering by defects, with carrier capture being a special case.
We distinguish between capture under thermal equilibrium conditions and capture
under non-equilibrium conditions, e.g., in the presence of electrical current
or hot carriers where carriers undergo scattering by defects and are described
by a mean free path. In the thermal-equilibrium case, capture is mediated by a
non-adiabatic perturbation Hamiltonian, originally identified by Huang and Rhys
and by Kubo, which is equal to linear electron-phonon coupling to first order.
In the non-equilibrium case, we demonstrate that the primary capture mechanism
is within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, with coupling to the defect
potential inducing Franck-Condon electronic transitions, followed by
multiphonon dissipation of the transition energy, while the non-adiabatic terms
are of secondary importance. We report density-functional-theory calculations
of the capture cross section for a prototype defect using the
Projector-Augmented-Wave which allows us to employ all-electron wavefunctions.
We adopt a Monte Carlo scheme to sample multiphonon configurations and obtain
converged results. The theory and the results represent a foundation upon which
to build engineering-level models for hot-electron degradation of power devices
and the performance of solar cells and light-emitting diodes.

(c) minimize degree of QoS violations. The CP problem is NP-Hard, hence we
design a unique push-based heuristic, called Weighted Social Network Analysis
(W-SNA) for CCDN providers. W-SNA is based on Betweeness Centrality (BC) from
SNA and prioritizes surrogates based on their relationship to the other
vertices in the network graph. To achieve our unique objectives, we further
prioritize surrogates based on weights derived from storage cost and content

Moreover, W-SNA guarantees SLA but also minimizes the degree of QoS violations.

scale machine learning models over big data. A stochastic gradient is typically
calculated from a limited number of samples (known as mini-batch), so it
potentially incurs a high variance and causes the estimated parameters bounce
around the optimal solution. To improve the stability of stochastic gradient,
recent years have witnessed the proposal of several semi-stochastic gradient
descent algorithms, which distinguish themselves from standard SGD by
incorporating global information into gradient computation. In this paper we
contribute a novel stratified semi-stochastic gradient descent (S3GD) algorithm
to this nascent research area, accelerating the optimization of a large family
of composite convex functions. Though theoretically converging faster, prior
semi-stochastic algorithms are found to suffer from high iteration complexity,
which makes them even slower than SGD in practice on many datasets. In our
proposed S3GD, the semi-stochastic gradient is calculated based on efficient
manifold propagation, which can be numerically accomplished by sparse matrix
multiplications. This way S3GD is able to generate a highly-accurate estimate
of the exact gradient from each mini-batch with largely-reduced computational
complexity. Theoretic analysis reveals that the proposed S3GD elegantly
balances the geometric algorithmic convergence rate against the space and time
complexities during the optimization. The efficacy of S3GD is also
experimentally corroborated on several large-scale benchmark datasets.

evaluation of field-induced entropy changes in related materials. An analysis
of the relative cooling power (RCP), based on the integrated field-induced

brightness due to its temperature contrast. We first explore the
characteristics of perturbations in polarimetric microlensing during
caustic-crossing of a binary lensing as follows: (a) The cooler spots over the
Galactic bulge sources have the smaller contributions in the total flux,
although they have stronger magnetic fields. (b) The maximum deviation in the
polarimetry curve due to the spot happens when the spot is located near the
source edge and the source spot is first entering the caustic whereas the
maximum photometric deviation occurs for the spots located at the source
center. (c) There is a (partial) degeneracy for indicating spot's size, its
temperature contrast and its magnetic induction from the deviations in light or
polarimetric curves. (d) If the time when the photometric deviation due to spot
becomes zero (between positive and negative deviations) is inferred from
microlensing light curves, we can indicate the magnification factor of the
spot, characterizing the spot properties except its temperature contrast. The
stellar spots alter the polarization degree as well as strongly change its

axion-like pseudoscalar and scalar dark matter, which form either a coherent
condensate or topological defects (solitons). In these new detection methods,
the sought effects are linear in the interaction constant between dark matter

dark matter, where the sought effects are quadratic or higher order in the
underlying interaction constants (which are extremely small).

unification of gravity with weak $SU(2)$ interactions in the assumption of the
existence of visible and invisible sectors of the Universe. Assuming the
interaction between the ordinary and mirror Higgs fields, we develop a special
Hybrid model of inflation. According to this model, the inflaton starts trapped
from the ""false vacuum"" of the Universe at the Higgs field VEV $v\sim 10^{18}$
GeV (in the visible world). Then the inflations of the two Higgs doublet
fields, visible $\phi$ and mirror $\phi'$, lead to the emergence of the
Standard Model vacua at the Electroweak scales with the Higgs boson VEVs
$v_1\approx 246$ GeV and $v'_1=\zeta v_1$ in the visible and invisible worlds,
respectively. Considering the results of cosmology and calculating the number
of e-folds $N^*$, we predict $\zeta\simeq 100-115$ for $N^*\simeq 50-60$, in
agreement with previous results of the model with broken mirror parity. We also
consider RGEs, taking into account the mixing term - the interaction between
the ordinary and mirror Higgs bosons, assuming the smallness of the mixing

occur due to different final stationary states, specifically for strong

The hydrogen production using semiconductors such as TiO2 suffers from several

desired. Recently, photocatalysis using different nanostructures has been
studied.1-6 In this project, we have studied the catalytic activity of
gold/cadmium sulphide (Au/CdS) NCs to reduce protons into hydrogen
qualitatively. The Au/CdS NCs absorb a large amount of visible photons due to
plasmon resonance and create electron-hole pairs. The excited electrons migrate
to the catalysts, and the protons are reduced while the ligands on the surface
of NCs scavenge holes. Thus, photocatalysis occurs due to the energy transfer
from metal to semiconductor materials. The hydrogen production using Au/CdS
metal semiconductor NCs is more efficient than that of using CdS semiconductor
NCs.

The report concerns a more difficult diffusion case when communities are made
of stubborn agents. Communities having markedly different opinions are for
example the Neocreationist and Intelligent Design Proponents (IDP), on one
hand, and the Darwinian Evolution Defenders (DED), on the other hand. The case
of knowledge diffusion within such communities is studied here on a network
based on an adjacency matrix built from time ordered selected quotations of
agents, whence for inter- and intra-communities. The network is intrinsically
directed and not necessarily reciprocal. Thus, the adjacency matrices have
complex eigenvalues, the eigenvectors present complex components. A
quantification of the slow-down or speed-up effects of information diffusion in
such temporal networks, with non-Markovian contact sequences, can be made by
comparing the real time dependent (directed) network to its counterpart, the
time aggregated (undirected) network, - which has real eigenvalues. In order to
do so, small world networks which both contain an $odd$ number of nodes are
studied and compared to similar networks with an $even$ number of nodes.
  It is found that (i) the diffusion of knowledge is more difficult on the
largest networks, (ii) the network size influences the slowing-down or
speeding-up diffusion process. Interestingly, it is observed that (iii) the
diffusion of knowledge is slower in IDP and faster in DED communities. It is
suggested that the finding can be ""rationalized"", if some ""scientific quality""
and ""publication habit"" is attributed to the agents, as common sense would
guess. This finding offers some opening discussion toward tying scientific
knowledge to belief.

5450 W/m-K for infinite unstrained graphene, while $\kappa$ diverges for

different $\kappa$ behaviors for these systems are further validated
mathematically through phonon lifetime analysis. Flexural acoustic phonons are
the dominant heat carriers in both unstrained and strained graphene within the

contribute to finite size effects on $\kappa$ for samples as large as 8 cm at
room temperature. The calculated size-dependent and temperature-dependent
$\kappa$ for finite samples agree well with experimental data, demonstrating
the ability of the present approach to predict $\kappa$ of larger graphene

lifetimes, causing interesting dependence of $\kappa$ on sample size and strain
due to the competition between boundary scattering and intrinsic phonon-phonon
scattering. These findings shed light on the nature of thermal transport in

turns out that there are two covariance issues whose address is the main theme
of the present work. Although the unphysical character of the trace piece of
the fluctuation metric has been long known, it has not been taken care of in a
manner suitable for the Feynman diagram computations; a proper handling of the
trace piece through gauge-fixing is the key to more subtler of the covariance
issues. As for the second covariance issue, a renormalization program can be
carried out covariantly to any loop order at intermediate steps, thereby
maintaining the 4D covariance; it is only at the final stage that one should
consider the 3D physical external states. With the physical external states,
the 1PI effective action reduces to 3D and renormalizability is restored just

a second quantized reformulation of loop quantum gravity as well as generating

arbitrary valence, group field theories have been defined so far in a
simplicial setting such that states have support only on graphs of fixed
valency. This has led to the question whether group field theory can indeed
cover the whole state space of loop quantum gravity. In this contribution based
on [1] I present two new classes of group field theories which satisfy this
objective: i) a straightforward, but rather formal generalization to multiple
fields, one for each valency and ii) a simplicial group field theory which
effectively covers the larger state space through a dual weighting, a technique
common in matrix and tensor models. To this end I will further discuss in some
detail the combinatorial structure of the complexes generated by the group
field theory partition function. The new group field theories do not only
strengthen the links between the mentioned quantum gravity approaches but,
broadening the theory space of group field theories, they might also prove
useful in the investigation of renormalizability.

cognitive abilities have been demonstrated in Drosophila in the laboratory. By
devising an ethologically relevant experimental setup that also allows
comparison of behavior across remote taxonomic groups we sought to reduce the
gap between the field and the laboratory, and reveal as yet undiscovered
ethological phenomena within a wider phylogenetic perspective. We tracked
individual flies that eclosed in a small (45mm) arena containing a piece of
fruit, connected to a larger (130mm) arena by a wide (5mm) doorway. Using this
setup we show that the widely open doorway initially functions as a barrier:
the likelihood of entering the large arena increases gradually, requiring
repeated approaches to the doorway, and even after entering the flies
immediately return. Gradually the flies acquire the option to avoid returning,
spending more relative time and performing relatively longer excursions in the
large arena. The entire process may take up three successive days. This
behavior constitutes coping with space neophobia, the avoidance of untrodden
space. It appears to be the same as the neophobic doorway-crossing reported in
mouse models of anxiety. In both mice and flies the moment-to-moment
developmental dynamics of transition between trodden and untrodden terrain
appear to be the same, and in mice it is taken to imply memory and, therefore,
cognition. Recent claims have been made for a deep homology between the
arthropod central complex and the vertebrate basal ganglia, two structures
involved in navigation. The shared dynamics of space occupancy in flies and
mice might indicate the existence of cognitive exploration also in the flies or
else a convergent structure exhibiting the same developmental dynamics.

  General Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2001 Thorup and Zwick devised a distance oracle, which given an $n$-vertex
undirected graph and a parameter $k$, has size $O(k n^{1+1/k})$. Upon a query
$(u,v)$ their oracle constructs a $(2k-1)$-approximate path $\Pi$ between $u$
and $v$. The query time of the Thorup-Zwick's oracle is $O(k)$, and it was
subsequently improved to $O(1)$ by Chechik. A major drawback of the oracle of
Thorup and Zwick is that its space is $\Omega(n \cdot \log n)$. Mendel and Naor
devised an oracle with space $O(n^{1+1/k})$ and stretch $O(k)$, but their
oracle can only report distance estimates and not actual paths. In this paper
we devise a path-reporting distance oracle with size $O(n^{1+1/k})$, stretch
$O(k)$ and query time $O(n^\epsilon)$, for an arbitrarily small $\epsilon > 0$.
In particular, our oracle can provide logarithmic stretch using linear size.
Another variant of our oracle has size $O(n \log\log n)$, polylogarithmic
stretch, and query time $O(\log\log n)$.
  For unweighted graphs we devise a distance oracle with multiplicative stretch
$O(1)$, additive stretch $O(\beta(k))$, for a function $\beta(\cdot)$, space
$O(n^{1+1/k} \cdot \beta)$, and query time $O(n^\epsilon)$, for an arbitrarily
small constant $\epsilon >0$. The tradeoff between multiplicative stretch and
size in these oracles is far below girth conjecture threshold (which is stretch
$2k-1$ and size $O(n^{1+1/k})$). Breaking the girth conjecture tradeoff is
achieved by exhibiting a tradeoff of different nature between additive stretch
$\beta(k)$ and size $O(n^{1+1/k})$. A similar type of tradeoff was exhibited by
a construction of $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-spanners due to Elkin and Peleg.
However, so far $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-spanners had no counterpart in the
distance oracles' world.
  An important novel tool that we develop on the way to these results is a
{distance-preserving path-reporting oracle}.

entanglement entropy for arbitrary entangling surface. In 3D we find no anomaly
of entropy appears. But the squashed cone method can not be used directly to
get the correct result. For higher dimensions the anomaly of entropy would
appear, still, we can not use the squashed cone method directly. That is
becasuse the Chern-Simons action is not gauge invariant. To get a reasonable
result we suggest two methods. One is by adding a boundary term to recover the
gauge invariance. This boundary term can be derived from the variation of the
Chern-Simons action. The other one is by using the Chern-Simons relation
$d\bm{\Omega_{4n-1}}=tr(\bm{R}^{2n})$. We notice that the entropy of
$tr(\bm{R}^{2n})$ is a total derivative locally, i.e. $S=d s_{CS}$. We propose
to identify $s_{CS}$ with the entropy of gravitational Chern-Simons terms
$\Omega_{4n-1}$. In the first method we could get the correct result for Wald
entropy in arbitrary dimension. In the second approach, in addition to Wald
entropy, we can also obtain the anomaly of entropy with non-zero extrinsic
curvatures. Our results imply that the entropy of a topological invariant, such
as the Pontryagin term $tr(\bm{R}^{2n})$ and the Euler density, is a
topological invariant on the entangling surface.

producing travelling localised excitation wave-fragments, distant relatives of

depend on the illumination level of the medium. Under the right conditions the

periods. We interpret the wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. When
two or more wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new
wave-fragment. States of the logic variables, represented by the
wave-fragments, are changed in the result of the collision between the
wave-fragments. Thus, a logical gate is implemented. Several theoretical
designs and experimental laboratory implementations of Boolean logic gates have
been proposed in the past but little has been done cascading the gates into
binary arithmetical circuits. We propose a unique design of a binary one-bit
full adder based on a fusion gate. A fusion gate is a two-input three-output
logical device which calculates conjunction of the input variables and
conjunction of one input variable with negation of another input variable. The
gate is made of three channels: two channels cross each other at an angle,
third channel starts at the junction. The channels contain BZ medium. When two
excitation wave-fragments, travelling towards each other along input channels,
collide at the junction they merge into a single wave-front travelling along
the third channel. If there is just one wave-front in the input channel, the
front continues its propagation undisturbed. We make a one-bit full adder by
cascading two fusion gates. We show how to cascade the adder blocks into a
many-bit full adder. We evaluate feasibility of our designs by simulating

in the emission wavelength and is explained by how the light-hole band raises
relative to the heavy-hole band due to uniaxial strain. Approximately 3.2%
uniaxial strain is required to achieve this anomalous threshold reduction for
1x1019 cm-3 n-type doping, and a complex interaction between uniaxial strain

substantial performance advantage for uniaxially strained Ge lasers relative to

which each vertex is constrained to have degree either $1$ or $2$. There are
three types of edge, and three corresponding parameters $a$, $b$, $c$. It is
proved that, when $a \ge b \ge c > 0$, the surface given by $\sqrt a = \sqrt b
+ \sqrt c$ is critical. The proof hinges upon a representation of the partition
function in terms of that of a certain dimer model. This dimer model may be
studied via the Pfaffian representation of Fisher, Kasteleyn, and Temperley. It
is proved, in addition, that the two-edge correlation function converges
exponentially fast with distance when $\sqrt a \ne \sqrt b + \sqrt c$. Many of
the results may be extended to periodic models.

two-dimensional conformal field theories is bounded linearly from above by the
number of relevant operators. In conformal field theories defined via sigma
models into Calabi-Yau manifolds, relevant operators can be estimated, in the
point-particle approximation, by the low-lying spectrum of the scalar Laplacian
on the manifold. In the strict large volume limit, the standard asymptotic
expansion of Weyl and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel diverges with the higher-order
curvature invariants. We propose that it would be sufficient to find an a
priori uniform bound on the trace of the heat kernel for large but finite
volume. As a first step in this direction, we then study the heat trace
asymptotics, as well as the actual spectrum of the scalar Laplacian, in the
vicinity of a conifold singularity. The eigenfunctions can be written in terms
of confluent Heun functions, the analysis of which gives evidence that regions
of large curvature will not prevent the existence of a bound of this type. This
is also in line with general mathematical expectations about spectral
continuity for manifolds with conical singularities. A sharper version of our
results could, in combination with the SCHOK bound, provide a basis for a
global restriction on the dimension of the moduli space of Calabi-Yau
manifolds.

some L\'{e}vy processes. First, we revisit some existing results on the
magnitude of drawdowns for spectrally negative L\'{e}vy processes using an
approximation approach. For any spectrally negative L\'{e}vy process whose
scale functions are well-behaved at $0+$, we then study the asymptotics of
drawdown quantities when the threshold of drawdown magnitude approaches zero.
We also show that such asymptotics is robust to perturbations of additional
positive compound Poisson jumps. Finally, thanks to the asymptotic results and
some recent works on the running maximum of L\'{e}vy processes, we derive the
law of duration of drawdowns for a large class of L\'{e}vy processes (with a
general spectrally negative part plus a positive compound Poisson structure).
The duration of drawdowns is also known as the ""Time to Recover"" (TTR) the
historical maximum, which is a widely used performance measure in the fund
management industry. We find that the law of duration of drawdowns
qualitatively depends on the path type of the spectrally negative component of
the underlying L\'{e}vy process.

The two key features of the discretization are (a) use of midpoint integration

mesh into complex space. Named complex-length finite element method (CFEM), the
technique is linked to Pade approximants that provide exponential convergence
of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps and thus the solution at specified points in
the domain. Exponential convergence facilitates drastic reduction in the number
of elements. This, combined with sparse computation associated with linear
finite elements, results in significant reduction in the computational cost.
