usually not equally respected in measuring research impact. {\it A priori}
unexpected relationships are found between the total coauthor core value,
$m_a$, of a leading investigator (LI), and the related values for their
publications in either peer review journals ($j$) or in proceedings ($p$). A
surprisingly linear relationship is found: $ m_a^{(j)} + 0.4\;m_a^{(p)} =
m_a^{(jp)} $. Furthermore, another relationship is found concerning the measure
of the total number of citations, $A_a$, i.e. the surface of the citation
size-rank histogram up to $m_a$. Another linear relationship exists :
$A_a^{(j)} + 1.36\; A_a^{(p)} = A_a^{(jp)} $. These empirical findings
coefficients (0.4 and 1.36) are supported by considerations based on an
empirical power law found between the number of joint publications of an author
and the rank of a coauthor. Moreover, a simple power law relationship is found
between $m_a$ and the number ($r_M$) of coauthors of a LI: $m_a\simeq
r_M^{\mu}$; the power law exponent $\mu$ depends on the type ($j$ or $p$) of
publications. These simple relations, at this time limited to publications in
physics, imply that coauthors are a ""more positive measure"" of a principal
investigator role, in both types of scientific outputs, than the Hirsch index
could indicate. Therefore, to scorn upon co-authors in publications, in
particular in proceedings, is incorrect. On the contrary, the findings suggest
an immediate test of coherence of scientific authorship in scientific policy
processes.

simplified balance control policy in place to prevent the credit limit being

mass-action law. We consider a closed system and nonequilibrium initial
conditions and show that the system dynamically evolves towards equilibrium
where detailed balance is satisfied. The entropy production during this process
can be expressed as the time derivative of a Lyapunov function. When the
solvent is not included in the description and the dynamics conserves the total
concentration of polymer, the Lyapunov function can be expressed as a
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the nonequilibrium and the equilibrium
polymer length distribution. The same result holds true when the solvent is
explicitly included in the description and the solution is assumed dilute,
whether or not the total polymer concentration is conserved. Furthermore, in
this case a consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic formulation can be
established and the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic enthalpy, entropy and free
energy can be identified. Such a framework is useful in complementing standard
kinetics studies with the dynamical evolution of thermodynamic quantities
during polymerization.

nonzero anapole moment. These phases are relevant to the physics of cuprate

  While the d-wave phase preserves translation, parity and time reversal
symmetry, the striped phases break translations spontaneously. Parity and
time-reversal are preserved when combined with discrete half-periodic shift of
the wave. In anapole phase translation symmetry is preserved, but parity and
time reversal are spontaneously broken. All of the considered solutions brake

with high-energy heavy ions can be used to create nanoscale defects that act as
deep pinning potentials for vortices. This approach holds unique promise for
high current applications of iron-based superconductors because Jc
amplification persists to much higher radiation doses than in cuprate
superconductors without significantly altering the superconducting critical
temperature. However, for these compounds virtually nothing is known about the
atomic scale interplay of the crystal damage from the high-energy ions, the
superconducting order parameter, and the vortex pinning processes. Here, we
visualize the atomic-scale effects of irradiating FeSexTe1-x with 249 MeV Au

disruption or 'columnar defects', plus a higher density of single atomic-site
'point' defects probably from secondary scattering. We show directly that the
superconducting order is virtually annihilated within the former while
suppressed by the latter. Simultaneous atomically-resolved images of the
columnar crystal defects, the superconductivity, and the vortex configurations,
then reveal how a mixed pinning landscape is created, with the strongest
pinning occurring at metallic-core columnar defects and secondary pinning at
clusters of pointlike defects, followed by collective pinning at higher fields.

the International Halley Watch (IHW), narrowband photometry was obtained with
telescopes at 18 observatories. Following submissions to and basic reductions
by the Photometry and Polarimetry Network of the IHW, we computed production
rates and created composite lightcurves for each species. These were used to
measure how the apparent rotational period (~7.35 day), along with its shape,
evolved with time during the apparition. The lightcurve shape systematically
varied from double-peaked to triple-peaked and back again every 8-9 weeks, due
to Halley's non-principal axis (complex) rotation and the associated component
periods. Unexpectedly, we found a phase shift of one-half cycle also took place
during this interval, and therefore the actual beat frequency between the
component periods is twice this interval or 16-18 weeks. Preliminary modeling
suggests that a single source might produce the entire post-perihelion
lightcurve variability and associated evolution. The detailed evolution of the
apparent period varied in a non-smooth manner between 7.2 and 7.6 day, likely
due to a combination of synodic effects and the interaction of solar
illumination with isolated source regions on a body in complex rotation. The
need to simultaneously reproduce each of these characteristics will provide
very strong additional constraints on Halley's component periods associated
with its complex rotation. To assist in these and future analyses, we created a
synthetic lightcurve based directly on the measured data. We unexpectedly
discovered a strong correlation of ion tail disconnection event start times
with minima in the comet's gas production, implying that a decrease in
outgassing is another cause of these events.

the pre-defined MRF dictionary entries, we proposed a parameter separable MRF
DGS method, which breaks the multiplicative computation complexity into an
additive one and enabling a resolution scalable multi-resolution DGS process,
which was dubbed as MRF ZOOM. The evaluation results showed that MRF ZOOM was
hundreds or thousands of times faster than the original brute-force DGS method.
The acceleration was even higher when considering the time difference for
generating the dictionary. Using a high precision quantification, MRF can find
the right parameter values for a 64x64 imaging slice in 117 secs. Our data also
showed that spatial constraints can be used to further speed up MRF ZOOM.

experiment recorded 16 radio signals that were emitted by cosmic-ray induced
air showers. For 14 of these events, this radiation was reflected from the ice.
The dominant contribution to the radiation from the deflection of positrons and
electrons in the geomagnetic field, which is beamed in the direction of motion
of the air shower. This radiation is reflected from the ice and subsequently
detected by the ANITA experiment at a flight altitude of 36km. In this paper,
we estimate the energy of the 14 individual events and find that the mean
energy of the cosmic-ray sample is 2.9 EeV. By simulating the ANITA flight, we
calculate its exposure for ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We estimate for the
first time the cosmic-ray flux derived only from radio observations. In
addition, we find that the Monte Carlo simulation of the ANITA data set is in
agreement with the total number of observed events and with the properties of
those events.

nonthermal THz magnetic switching may never be reachable in conventional

coherently precess with the THz magnetic field, the deposited THz energy
initiates ultrafast demagnetization and ultimately material damage. These

reliable scheduling and provision of frequency reserves by aggregations of
commercial buildings. The framework incorporates energy-constrained frequency
signals, which are adopted by several transmission system operators for loads
and storage devices. We use a hierarchical approach with three levels: (i)
reserve capacities are allocated among buildings (e.g., on a daily basis) using
techniques from robust optimization, (ii) a robust model predictive controller
optimizes the HVAC system consumption typically every 30 minutes, and (iii) a
feedback controller adjusts the consumption to provide reserves in real time.
We demonstrate how the framework can be used to estimate the reserve capacities
in simulations with typical Swiss office buildings and different reserve
product characteristics. Our results show that an aggregation of approximately
100 buildings suffices to meet the 5 MW minimum bid size of the Swiss reserve
market.

attention was paid on the percentage contribution to the total muon-capture

  Maximization",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a high-performance hybrid algorithm, called Hybrid
Hypervolume Maximization Algorithm (H2MA), for multi-objective optimization
that alternates between exploring the decision space and exploiting the already
obtained non-dominated solutions. The proposal is centered on maximizing the
hypervolume indicator, thus converting the multi-objective problem into a
single-objective one. The exploitation employs gradient-based methods, but
considering a single candidate efficient solution at a time, to overcome
limitations associated with population-based approaches and also to allow an
easy control of the number of solutions provided. There is an interchange
between two steps. The first step is a deterministic local exploration, endowed
with an automatic procedure to detect stagnation. When stagnation is detected,
the search is switched to a second step characterized by a stochastic global
exploration using an evolutionary algorithm. Using five ZDT benchmarks with 30
variables, the performance of the new algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms for multi-objective optimization, more specifically NSGA-II, SPEA2,
and SMS-EMOA. The solutions found by the H2MA guide to higher hypervolume and
smaller distance to the true Pareto frontier with significantly less function
evaluations, even when the gradient is estimated numerically. Furthermore,
although only continuous decision spaces have been considered here, discrete
decision spaces could also have been treated, replacing gradient-based search
by hill-climbing. Finally, a thorough explanation is provided to support the
expressive gain in performance that was achieved.

Schemmel totient functions, that generalizes the Euler totient function. For
each Schemmel totient function $L_m$, we define two new functions, denoted
$R_m$ and $H_m$, that arise from iterating $L_m$. Roughly speaking, $R_m$
counts the number of iterations of $L_m$ needed to reach either $0$ or $1$, and
$H_m$ takes the value (either $0$ or $1$) that the iteration trajectory
eventually reaches. Our first major result is a proof that, for any positive
integer $m$, the function $H_m$ is completely multiplicative. We then introduce
an iterate summatory function, denoted $D_m$, and define the terms
$D_m$-deficient, $D_m$-perfect, and $D_m$-abundant. We proceed to prove several
results related to these definitions, culminating in a proof that, for all
positive even integers $m$, there are infinitely many $D_m$-abundant numbers.
Many open problems arise from the introduction of these functions and terms,
and we mention a few of them, as well as some numerical results.

identify computational primitives that theory and experiments suggest as
generic and reusable cognitive elements. One such element is provided by
attractor dynamics in recurrent networks. Point attractors are equilibrium
states of the dynamics (up to fluctuations), determined by the synaptic
structure of the network; a `basin' of attraction comprises all initial states
leading to a given attractor upon relaxation, hence making attractor dynamics
suitable to implement robust associative memory. The initial network state is
dictated by the stimulus, and relaxation to the attractor state implements the
retrieval of the corresponding memorized prototypical pattern. In a previous
work we demonstrated that a neuromorphic recurrent network of spiking neurons
and suitably chosen, fixed synapses supports attractor dynamics. Here we focus
on learning: activating on-chip synaptic plasticity and using a theory-driven
strategy for choosing network parameters, we show that autonomous learning,
following repeated presentation of simple visual stimuli, shapes a synaptic
connectivity supporting stimulus-selective attractors. Associative memory
develops on chip as the result of the coupled stimulus-driven neural activity
and ensuing synaptic dynamics, with no artificial separation between learning

by having all interaction terms in the Lagrangian be couplings between null
fields, specific combinations of positive and negative-metric PV fields. The
construction is done in steps, beginning with a gauge-invariant Lagrangian with
massless PV gluons and degenerate-mass PV quarks. Auxiliary scalars are
introduced to give mass to the PV gluons, and break the mass degeneracy of the
PV quarks, following a method due to Stueckelberg. Gauge fixing terms for the
gluon fields are a part of this construction. The ghost terms are then obtained
and shown to provide the BRST invariance. A lack of dependence on the gauge
parameter can be checked by the calculation of physical quantities for a range
of values of the parameter.

transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDCs), and black phosphorus (BP) have
intriguing fundamental physical properties and bear promise of numerous
important applications in electronics and optics. Of them, BP is a novel 2D
material that has been theoretically predicted to acquire plasmonic behavior
for frequencies below ~0.4 eV when highly doped. The electronic properties of
BP are unique due to an anisotropic structure, which could strongly influence
collective electronic excitations. Advantages of BP as a material for
nanoelectronics and nanooptics are due to the fact that, in contrast to metals,
the free carrier density in it can be dynamically controlled by electrostatic
gating, which has been demonstrated by its use in field-effect transistors.
Despite all the interest that BP attracts, near-field and plasmonic properties
of BP have not yet been investigated experimentally. Here we report the first
observation of nanoscopic near-field properties of BP. We have discovered near
field patterns of outside bright fringes and high surface polarizability of
nanofilm BP consistent with its surface-metallic, plasmonic behavior at
mid-infrared (mid-IR) frequencies. This behavior is highly
frequency-dispersive, disappearing above frequency, {\omega} =1070 cm-1, which
allowed us to estimate the plasma frequency and carrier density. We have also
observed similar behavior in other 2D semiconductors such as TMDCs but not in
2D insulators such as boron nitride. This new phenomenon is attributed to
surface charging of the semiconductor nanofilms. This discovery opens up a new
field of research and potential applications in nanoplasmonics and
optoelectronics.

most modern applications, auto-scaling is an economic matter of great
importance. For applications like stream computing that process ever changing
amounts of data, modifying the number and configuration of resources to meet
performance requirements becomes essential. Current solutions on auto-scaling
are mostly rule-based using infrastructure level metrics such as
CPU/memory/network utilization, and system level metrics such as throughput and
response time. In this paper, we introduce a study on how effective
auto-scaling can be using data generated by the application itself. To make
this assessment, two algorithms are proposed that use a priori knowledge of the
data stream and use sentiment analysis from soccer-related tweets, triggering
auto-scaling operations according to rapid changes in the public sentiment
about the soccer players that happens just before big bursts of messages. Our
application-based auto-scaling was able to reduce the number of SLA violations
by up to 95% and reduce resource requirements by up to 33%.

also found evidence that the XLF of LMXBs in globular clusters (GCs) is overall
flatter than that of field LMXBs. Thus our results for this galaxy do not
support the idea that all LMXBs are formed in GCs. The XLF of field LMXBs seems
to show spatial variation, with the XLF in the inner region of the galaxy being
flatter than that in the outer region, probably due to contamination of LMXBs
from undetected and/or disrupted GCs in the inner region. The XLF in the outer
region is probably the XLF of primordial field LMXBs, exhibiting dN/dL \propto
L^{-1.2\pm0.1} up to a break close to the Eddington limit of neutron star LMXBs
(~1.7x10^38 erg/s). The break of the GC LMXB XLF is lower, at ~1.1x10^37 erg/s.
We also confirm previous findings that the metal-rich/red GCs are more likely
to host LMXBs than the metal-poor/blue GCs, which is more significant for more
luminous LMXBs, and that more massive GCs are more likely to host LMXBs.

Galactic LMXBs. We found that in the L_X versus photon index \Gamma_PL and L_X

track in which the spectral shape hardens with increasing luminosity below
L_X~7x10^37 erg/s but is relatively constant (\Gamma_PL~1.5 or kT_MCD~1.5 keV)
above this luminosity, similar to the spectral evolution of Galactic neutron
star (NS) LMXBs in the soft state in the Chandra bandpass. Therefore we
identified the track as the NS LMXB soft-state track and suggested sources with
L_X<7x10^37 erg/s as atolls in the soft state and those with L_X>7x10^37 erg/s

causal order, where the order of a set of events can depend on other events in
the past. Starting from a general definition of causality, we derive an
iteratively formulated canonical decomposition of multipartite causal
processes, and show that for a fixed number of settings and outcomes for each

inequalities. In the case of quantum processes, we investigate the link between
causality and the theory-dependent notion of causal separability, which we here
extend to the multipartite case based on concrete principles. We show that
causality and causal separability are not equivalent in general by giving an
example of a physically admissible tripartite quantum process that is causal
but not causally separable. We also show that there exist causally separable
(and hence causal) quantum processes that become non-causal if extended by
supplying the parties with entangled ancillas. This example of activation of
non-causality motivates the concepts of extensibly causal and extensibly
causally separable (ECS) processes, for which the respective property remains
invariant under extension with arbitrary ancillas. We characterize the class of
tripartite ECS processes in terms of simple conditions on the form of the
process matrix, which generalize the form of bipartite causally separable
process matrices. We show that the processes realizable by classically
controlled quantum circuits are ECS and conjecture that the reverse also holds.

distributions, the linear-mean SFR of AGNs derived from our distributions is
remarkably consistent with that of MS galaxies, and thus with previous results

These mappings connect topologically inequivalent systems of fermions, jumping

our study to established classification tables, we define and characterize
mathematically Gaussian dualities as dualities mapping free fermions to free

We run a large number of long-term numerical integrations and use the Support
Vector Machine algorithm to search for an empirical boundary that best
separates stable systems from systems experiencing either ejections or
collisions with the star. We propose the following new criterion for dynamical
stability: $a_{\rm out}(1-e_{\rm out})/[a_{\rm in}(1+e_{\rm
in})]>2.4\left[\max(\mu_{\rm in},\mu_{\rm out})\right]^{1/3}(a_{\rm out}/a_{\rm
in})^{1/2}+1.15$, which should be applicable to planet-star mass ratios
$\mu_{\rm in},\mu_{\rm out}=10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, integration times up to $10^8$
orbits of the inner planet, and mutual inclinations $\lesssim40^\circ$. Systems
that do not satisfy this condition by a margin of $\gtrsim0.5$ are expected to
be unstable, mostly leading to planet ejections if $\mu_{\rm in}>\mu_{\rm
out}$, while slightly favoring collisions with the star for $\mu_{\rm
in}<\mu_{\rm out}$. We use our numerical integrations to test other stability
criteria that have been proposed in the literature and show that our stability
criterion performs significantly better for the range of system parameters that
we have explored.

the other hand, the disk axis is misaligned initially with ~ 30[deg.] for
i_tilt,0 = 60[deg.], and the alignment with the remnant BH spin is achieved at
~ 50--60 ms after the onset of merger. The accretion time scale of the remnant
disk is typically ~ 100 ms and depends only weakly on the misalignment angle

rising power-law continuum of hot dust (T_D ~ 200-1000K) in the near-IR
indicating that their mid-IR luminosity is dominated by an an active galactic

formation. Alternatively, it may be that the mid-IR emission arising from AGN
activity is dominant but the torus is sufficiently opaque to make the near-IR
emission from the AGN negligible with respect to the emission from the host
component. In an effort to characterize the astrophysical nature of the
processes responsible for the IR emission in DOGs, this paper exploits Herschel
data (PACS + SPIRE) on a sample of 95 DOGs within the COSMOS field. We derive a
wealth of far-IR properties (e.g., total IR luminosities; mid-to-far IR colors;
dust temperatures and masses) based on SED fitting. Of particular interest are
the 24 um-bright DOGs (F_24um > 1mJy). They present bluer far-IR/mid-IR colors
than the rest of the sample, unveiling the potential presence of an AGN. The
AGN contribution to the total 8-1000 um flux increases as a function of the
rest-frame 8 um-luminosity irrespective of the redshift. This confirms that
faint DOGs (L_8 um< 10^12 L_sun) are dominated by star-formation while brighter

asymptotically optimal in the sense that the determinant of the posterior

asymptotically minimal. Using this result, we also obtain an asymptotic
expression for the posterior entropy based on a novel definition of almost sure

of trials that converges to one). Then, we extend the results to a recently
published framework, which generalizes the usual adaptive estimation setting by
allowing different trial placements to be associated with different, random
costs of observation. For this setting, the author has proposed the heuristic
of maximizing the expected information gain divided by the expected cost of
that placement. In this paper, we show that this myopic strategy satisfies an
analogous asymptotic optimality result when the convergence of the posterior

of asynchronous distributed quadratic programming (QP) with dual decomposition
technique. In general, distributed optimization requires synchronization of
data at each iteration step due to the interdependency of data. This
synchronization latency may incur a large amount of waiting time caused by an
idle process during computation. We aim to attack this synchronization penalty
in distributed QP problems by implementing asynchronous update of dual
variable. The price to pay for adopting asynchronous computing algorithms is
unpredictability of the solution, resulting in a tradeoff between speedup and
accuracy. Thus, the convergence to an optimal solution is not guaranteed owing
to the stochastic behavior of asynchrony. In this paper, we employ the switched
system framework as an analysis tool to investigate the convergence of
asynchronous distributed QP. This switched system will facilitate analysis on
asynchronous distributed QP with dual decomposition, providing necessary and
sufficient conditions for the mean square convergence. Also, we provide an
analytic expression for the rate of convergence through the switched system,
which enables performance analysis of asynchronous algorithms as compared with
synchronous case. To verify the validity of the proposed methods, numerical

the accelerating and focusing wake phase, leading to the formation of
high-quality witness-bunches [Martinez de la Ossa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,
245003 (2013)]. The electron-beam drivers must feature high-peak currents
($I_b^0\gtrsim 8.5~\mathrm{kA}$) and a duration comparable to the plasma
wavelength to excite plasma waves in the blowout regime and enable WII
injection. In this regime, the disparity of the magnitude of the electric field
in the driver region and the electric field in the rear of the ion cavity
allows for the selective ionization and subsequent trapping from a narrow phase
interval. The witness bunches generated in this manner feature a short duration
and small values of the normalized transverse emittance ($k_p\sigma_z \sim
k_p\epsilon_n \sim 0.1$). In addition, we show that the amount of injected
charge can be adjusted by tuning the concentration of the dopant gas species,
which allows for controlled beam loading and leads to a reduction of the total
energy spread of the witness beams. Electron bunches, produced in this way,
fulfil the requirements to drive blowout regime plasma wakes at a higher
density and to trigger WII injection in a second stage. This suggests a
promising new concept of self-similar staging of WII injection in steps with
increasing plasma density, giving rise to the potential of producing electron
beams with unprecedented energy and brilliance from plasma-wakefield

their extent depends on the interface scattering strength and the relative $F$

layer magnetization orientations, we find that the charge supercurrent can
reverse directions or vanish altogether. These findings are discussed in the
context of the generation and long-range nature of triplet pair correlation. We
also investigate the spin currents and associated spin transfer torques

non-conserved spin currents in a given $F$ region gives rise to net torques

galaxies of which Leo P is clearly a member. The star responsible for ionizing
the HII region is most likely an O7V or O8V spectral type, with a stellar mass
>25 Msun. The presence of this star provides observational evidence that
massive stars at the upper-end of the initial mass function are capable of
being formed at star formation rates as low as ~10^-5 Msun/yr. The best-fitting

of reionization on its star formation history is subtle at best, and consistent

although our definitions are 2-categorical in natural, making no use of the
combinatorial details that differentiate each model.
  In this paper, we introduce cartesian fibrations, a certain class of
$\infty$-functors, and their groupoidal variants. Cartesian fibrations form a
cornerstone in the abstract treatment of ""category-like"" structures a la Street
and play an important role in Lurie's work on quasi-categories. After setting
up their basic theory, we state and prove the Yoneda lemma, which has the form
of an equivalence between the quasi-category of maps out of a representable
fibration and the quasi-category underlying the fiber over its representing
element. A companion paper will apply these results to establish a calculus of
modules between $\infty$-categories, which will be used to define and study
pointwise Kan extensions along $\infty$-functors.

atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets from the viewpoint of an astrophysicist.
Starting from the first law of thermodynamics, we demonstrate that the van't
Hoff equation (which describes the equilibrium constant), Arrhenius equation
(which describes the rate coefficients) and procedures associated with the
Gibbs free energy (minimisation, rescaling) have a common physical and
mathematical origin. We address an ambiguity associated with the equilibrium
constant, which is used to relate the forward and reverse rate coefficients,
and restate its two definitions. By necessity, one of the equilibrium constants
must be dimensionless and equate to an exponential function involving the Gibbs
free energy, while the other is a ratio of rate coefficients and must therefore
possess physical units. We demonstrate that the Arrhenius equation takes on a
functional form that is more general than previously stated without recourse to
tagging on ad hoc functional forms. Finally, we derive analytical models of
chemical systems, in equilibrium, with carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. We include
acetylene and are able to reproduce several key trends, versus temperature and
carbon-to-oxygen ratio, published in the literature. The rich variety of
behavior that mixing ratios exhibit as a function of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio
is merely the outcome of stoichiometric book-keeping and not the direct
consequence of temperature or pressure variations.

randomized source signals and receiver sensitivities. The method is designed to

overdetermined set of functions are formed from the Hadamard product between a

that this particular type of randomization tends to produce well-conditioned

from a Shepp-Logan phantom, successful image reconstructions are achieved for
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as 1. Evaluation of the randomization
approach is conducted by comparing condition numbers with other forms of signal
randomization. Image quality resulting from tomographic reconstructions is then
compared with an idealized synthetic aperture approach, which is subjected to a
comparable SNR. By root-mean-square-difference comparisons it is concluded that
- provided a sufficient level of oversampling - the dynamic transmit and
dynamic receive approach produces superior images, particularly in the presence
of low SNR.

is, one pentagon connected with one hexagon, which is indene like molecule
(C9H7) n+ (n=0 to 4). DFT based harmonic frequency analysis resulted that
observed spectrum could be almost reproduced by a suitable sum of ionized

expect to reproduce total spectrum. For a comparison, hexagon-hexagon molecule
naphthalene (C10H8) n+ was studied. Unfortunately, ionized naphthalene shows
little coincidence with observed one. Carbon pentagon- hexagon molecules may

energies in six uniform magnetic fields of varying strengths. The magnetic
moments are presented in a recent Letter. For the charged states, the
extraction of the polarizability requires careful treatment of Landau levels,
which enter non-trivially in the method that is employed. The nucleon
polarizabilities are found to be of similar magnitude to their physical values,

deuteron state and the spin-singlet $np$ state induced by the background
magnetic field is used to extract the short-distance two-nucleon counterterm,
${\bar L}_1$, of the pionless effective theory for $NN$ systems (equivalent to
the meson-exchange current contribution in nuclear potential models), that
dictates the cross-section for the $np\to d\gamma$ process near threshold.
Combined with previous determinations of NN scattering parameters, this enables
an ab initio determination of the threshold cross-section at these unphysical

couple to dark matter inhomogeneities. Through this coupling energy could be
transferred to/from the scalar field, which could possibly enter an accelerated

natural trigger for the onset of the acceleration of the universe, since dark
energy starts driving the expansion of the universe when matter inhomogeneities
become sufficiently strong. Here we study a possible realization of this idea
by coupling dark energy to dark matter via the linear growth function of matter
perturbations. The numerical results show that it is indeed possible to obtain
a viable cosmology with the expected series of radiation, matter and
dark-energy dominated eras. In particular, the current density of dark energy
is given by the value of the coupling parameters rather than by very special
initial conditions for the scalar field. In other words, this model - unlike
standard models of cosmic late acceleration - does not suffer from the
so-called ""coincidence problem"" and its related fine tuning of initial
conditions.

Way-size halo by comparing a high-resolution, moving-mesh cosmological
simulation with its dark matter-only counterpart. We identify three main
processes related to baryons -- adiabatic contraction, tidal disruption and
reionization -- which jointly shape the dark matter distribution in both the
main halo and its subhalos. The relative effect of each baryonic process
depends strongly on the subhalo mass. For massive subhalos with maximum
circular velocity $v_{\rm max} > 35 km/s$, adiabatic contraction increases the
dark matter concentration, making these halos less susceptible to tidal
disruption. For low-mass subhalos with $v_{\rm max} < 20 km/s$, reionization
effectively reduces their mass on average by $\approx$ 30% and $v_{\rm max}$ by
$\approx$ 20%. For intermediate subhalos with $20 km/s < v_{\rm max} < 35
km/s$, which share a similar mass range as the classical dwarf spheroidals,
strong tidal truncation induced by the main galaxy reduces their $v_{\rm max}$.
Moreover, the stellar disk of the main galaxy effectively depletes subhalos
near the central region. As a combined result of reionization and increased
tidal disruption, the total number of low-mass subhalos in the hydrodynamic
simulation is nearly halved compared to that of the $\textit{N-}$body
simulation. We do not find dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies, unlike previous
studies that employed bursty feedback-driven outflows. The substantial impact
of baryons on the abundance and internal structure of subhalos suggests that
galaxy formation and evolution models based on $\textit{N}$-body simulations
should include these physical processes as major components.

expressed mRNAs. Mapping-based assembly of RNA-seq reads sometimes is
infeasible due to lack of high-quality references. However, de novo assembly is
very challenging due to uneven expression levels among transcripts and also the
read coverage variation within a single transcript. Existing methods either
apply de Bruijn graphs of single-sized k-mers to assemble the full set of
transcripts, or conduct multiple runs of assembly, but still apply graphs of
single-sized k-mers at each run. However, a single k-mer size is not suitable
for all the regions of the transcripts with varied coverage. Contribution: This
paper presents a de novo assembler Bermuda with new insights for handling
uneven coverage. Opposed to existing methods that use a single k-mer size for
all the transcripts in each run of assembly, Bermuda self-adaptively uses a few
k-mer sizes to assemble different regions of a single transcript according to
their local coverage. As such, Bermuda can deal with uneven expression levels
and coverage not only among transcripts, but also within a single transcript.
Extensive tests show that Bermuda outperforms popular de novo assemblers in
reconstructing unevenly-expressed transcripts with longer length, better
contiguity and lower redundancy. Further, Bermuda is computationally efficient
with moderate memory consumption.

sparsity parameter is given. The focus is then on the problem of adaptation to
sparsity for the construction of confidence intervals. Ideally, an adaptive
confidence interval should have its length automatically adjusted to the
sparsity of the unknown regression vector, while maintaining a prespecified
coverage probability. It is shown that such a goal is in general not
attainable, except when the sparsity parameter is restricted to a small region
over which the confidence intervals have the optimal length of the usual
parametric rate. It is further demonstrated that the lack of adaptivity is not
due to the conservativeness of the minimax framework, but is fundamentally
caused by the difficulty of learning the bias accurately.

closed subspaces and relatively compact perturbation of their operator parts
are first established. This gives a characterization of compact perturbation in
terms of difference between the operator parts of perturbed and unperturbed
subspaces. It is shown that a self-adjoint subspace is still self-adjoint under
either relatively bounded perturbation with relative bound less than one or
relatively compact perturbation or compact perturbation with a certain
additional condition. By using these results, invariance of essential spectra
of self-adjoint subspaces is proved under relatively compact and compact

discussed. The results obtained in this paper generalize the corresponding

finite dimensional associative algebra that arose in the context of statistical
mechanics. Later in 1971, Penrose showed that this algebra can be realized in
terms of certain diagrams. Then in 1987, Jones showed that the Temperley--Lieb
algebra occurs naturally as a quotient of the Hecke algebra arising from a
Coxeter group of type $A$. This realization of the Temperley--Lieb algebra as a
Hecke algebra quotient was later generalized to the case of an arbitrary
Coxeter group by Graham.
  Cellular algebras were introduced by Graham and Lehrer, and are a class of
finite dimensional associative algebras defined in terms of a ""cell datum"" and
three axioms. The axioms allow one to define a set of modules for the algebra
known as cell modules, and one of the main strengths of the theory is that it
is relatively straightforward to construct and to classify the irreducible
modules for a cellular algebra in terms of quotients of the cell modules. In
this thesis, we present an associative diagram algebra that is a faithful
representation of a particular quotient of the Temperley--Lieb algebra of type
$D$, which has a basis indexed by the so-called type II fully commutative
elements of the Coxeter group of type $D$. By explicitly constructing a cell
datum for the corresponding diagram algebra, we show that the quotient is
cellular.

a capacity-constrained renewable power supplier (RPS) and a base station (BS)
that faces a predictable random connection demand from mobile user equipments

source and the conventional electric grid, seeks to specify the renewable power
inventory policy, i.e., the power storage level. On the other hand, the RPS
must strategically choose the energy amount that is supplied to the BS. An
M/M/1 make-to-stock queuing model is proposed to investigate the decentralized
decisions when the two parties optimize their individual costs in a
noncooperative manner. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game whose
Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies are characterized in order to identify the
causes of inefficiency in the decentralized operation. A set of simple linear
contracts are introduced to coordinate the system so as to achieve an optimal
system performance. The proposed approach is then extended to a setting with
one monopolistic RPS and N BSs that are privately informed of their optimal
energy inventory levels. In this scenario, we show that the widely-used
proportional allocation mechanism is no longer socially optimal. In order to
make the BSs truthfully report their energy demand, an incentive compatible

by taking into account the strange ($\sigma^{\ast}$ and $\phi$) mesons as well
as the light non-strange ($\sigma$, $\omega$, $\vec{\pi}$ and $\vec{\rho}$)
mesons. Relevant coupling constants are determined to reproduce the
experimental data of nuclear matter and hypernuclei in SU(3) flavor symmetry.
For quark matter, we employ the MIT bag model with one-gluon-exchange
interaction, and Gibbs criteria for chemical equilibrium in the phase
transition from hadrons to quarks. We find that the strange vector ($\phi$)
meson and the Fock contribution make the hadronic EoS stiff, and that the
maximum mass of a neutron star can be consistent with the observed mass of
heavy neutron stars even if the coexistence of hadrons and quarks takes place
in the core. However, in the present calculation the transition to pure quark
matter does not occur in stable neutron stars. Furthermore, the lower bound of
the critical chemical potential of the quark-hadron transition at zero
temperature turns out to be around 1.5 GeV in order to be consistent with the
recent observed neutron star data.

surfaces is vitally important in diverse situations and potentially controlled
by small-scale surface heterogeneity on the particle. Differences in the
behavior of patchy particles (flowing over uniform collectors) relative to the
reverse case of uniform particles (flowing over patchy collectors) are
quantified. Because a particle rotates more slowly than it translates in the
shear field near a collecting surface, the effective interaction time of a
patch on a particle is larger than that of a patch on the collector, suggesting
distinct particle capture tendencies in each case. This paper presents a new
computational approach to simulate the near-surface motion (rotation and
translation) of particles having nanoscale surface heterogeneities flowing over
uniform collectors. Small amounts of ~10 nm cationic patches randomly
distributed on a net-negative particle surface produced spatially varying DLVO
interactions that were computed via the Grid Surface Integration (GSI)
technique and then combined with hydrodynamic forces in a mobility tensor
formulation. Statistical analysis of simulated trajectories revealed fewer
extrema in the fluctuating particle-collector separation of heterogeneous
particles, compared with the reverse system geometry of uniform particles
flowing past a heterogeneous fixed surface. Additionally, the patchy particles
were captured to a lesser extent on uniform surfaces compared with the case of
uniform particles flowing above patchy collectors. Such behavior was dependent
on ionic strength, with the greatest differences obtained near a Debye length
of $\kappa^{-1} = 4$ nm for the $2a = 500$ nm simulated particles.

showed that we could treat our grammatical framework as a logic (as opposed to

treatment of many linguistic phenomena, it was also clear that a slightly more
expressive logical calculus was needed for many other cases. Therefore, many
extensions and variants of the Lambek calculus have been proposed, since the
eighties and up until the present day. As a result, there is now a large class
of calculi, each with its own empirical successes and theoretical results, but
also each with its own logical primitives. This raises the question: how do we
compare and evaluate these different logical formalisms? To answer this
question, I present two unifying frameworks for these extended Lambek calculi.
Both are proof net calculi with graph contraction criteria. The first calculus
is a very general system: you specify the structure of your sequents and it
gives you the connectives and contractions which correspond to it. The calculus
can be extended with structural rules, which translate directly into graph
rewrite rules. The second calculus is first-order (multiplicative
intuitionistic) linear logic, which turns out to have several other,
independently proposed extensions of the Lambek calculus as fragments. I will
illustrate the use of each calculus in building bridges between analyses
proposed in different frameworks, in highlighting differences and in helping to

that give rise to finite rank multidimensional Hankel and Toeplitz type
operators defined on general domains. In this paper we study how the additional
assumption of positive semidefinite affects the characterization of the
corresponding symbols, which we refer to as Carath\'eodory-Fejer type theorems.
We show that these theorems become particularly transparent in the continuous
setting, by providing elegant if and only if statements connecting the rank
with sums of exponential functions. We also discuss how these objects can be
discretized, giving rise to an interesting class of structured matrices that
inherit these desirable properties from their continuous analogs. We describe
how the continuous Kronecker theorem also applies to these structured matrices,
given sufficient sampling. We also provide a new proof for the
Carath\'eodory-Fejer theorem for block Toeplitz matrices, based on tools from
tensor algebra.

a theoretical framework, which was recently proposed by Schweizer et al. and
considers coupled local hopping and elastic distortion. For confined water, we
correctly describe the variation of the alpha-relaxation time tau_alpha as a
function of both temperature and position with respect to the interface.
Exploiting our knowledge of a cooperative length scale xi(T) from the
confinement studies, we quantitatively rationalize the glassy slowdown,
tau_alpha(T), and the Stokes-Einstein breakdown of bulk water. For both
confined and bulk liquid, variations of the alpha-relaxation time are
intimately related to changes of the cage-rattling amplitude.

so-called Galton-Watson process.We introduce in the first chapter of this

construct GW trees that describe the genealogy of a GW process. It is very easy
to recover the GW process from theGW tree as it is just the number of
individuals at each generation. We then give alternativeproofs of classical
results on GW processes using the tree formalism. We focus in particular onthe
extinction probability (which was the first question of F. Galton) and on the
description ofthe processes conditioned on extinction or non extinction.In a
second chapter, we focus on local limits of conditioned GW trees. In the
critical andsub-critical cases, the population becomesa.s. extinct and the
associated genealogical tree is finite. However, it has a small but
positiveprobability of being large (this notion must be precised). The question
that arises is to describethe law of the tree conditioned of being large, and
to say what exceptional event has occurredso that the tree is not typical. A
first answer to this question is due to H. Kesten whoconditioned a GW tree to
reach height n and look at the limit in distribution when n tends toinfinity.
There are however other ways of conditioning a tree to be large: conditioning
on havingmany vertices, or many leaves... We present here very recent general
results concerning this kindof problems due to the authors of this course and

the convectively excited internal waves propagating in the stratified zone.
Most of the convective energy is at low frequency, and corresponding waves are
localized to the vicinity of the interface. However, we show that some energy

higher frequency waves. Our data suggest that the internal wave field is
passively excited by the convective fluctuations, and the wave propagation is

failures. After a storage node fails, the lost data should be regenerated at a
replacement storage node as soon as possible to maintain the same level of
redundancy. Minimizing such a regeneration time is critical to the reliability
of distributed storage systems. Existing work commits to reduce the
regeneration time by either minimizing the regenerating traffic, or adjusting
the regenerating traffic patterns, whereas nodes participating data
regeneration are generally assumed to be given beforehand. However, such
regeneration time also depends heavily on the selection of the participating
nodes. Selecting different participating nodes actually involve different data
links between the nodes. Real-world distributed storage systems usually exhibit
heterogeneous link capacities. It is possible to further reduce the
regeneration time via exploiting such link capacity differences and avoiding
the link bottlenecks. In this paper, we consider the minimization of the
regeneration time by selecting the participating nodes in heterogeneous
networks. We analyze the regeneration time and propose node selection
algorithms for overlay networks and real-world topologies. Considering that the
flexible amount of data blocks from each provider may deeply influence the
regeneration time, several techniques are designed to enhance our schemes in
overlay networks. Experimental results show that our node selection schemes can
significantly reduce the regeneration time for each topology, especially in
practical networks with heterogeneous link capacities.

energy consumption in next-generation cellular networks. However, CSO poses
serious challenges not only from the resource allocation perspective but also
from the implementation point of view. Indeed, CSO represents a difficult
optimization problem due to its NP-complete nature. Moreover, there are a
number of important practical limitations in the implementation of CSO schemes,
such as the need for minimizing the real-time complexity and the number of
on-off/off-on transitions and CSO-induced handovers. This article introduces a
novel approach to CSO based on multiobjective optimization that makes use of
the statistical description of the service demand (known by operators). In
addition, downlink and uplink coverage criteria are included and a comparative
analysis between different models to characterize intercell interference is
also presented to shed light on their impact on CSO. The framework
distinguishes itself from other proposals in two ways: 1) The number of
on-off/off-on transitions as well as handovers are minimized, and 2) the
computationally-heavy part of the algorithm is executed offline, which makes
its implementation feasible. The results show that the proposed scheme achieves
substantial energy savings in small cell deployments where service demand is
not uniformly distributed, without compromising the Quality-of-Service (QoS) or
requiring heavy real-time processing.

resolve some of the largest GMCs. Using a Bayesian fitting approach, we
generate scaling relations for the sizes, line widths, and virial masses of the
structures identified in this work. We do not find evidence for a tight power
law relation between size and line width, although the limited dynamic range in
cloud size remains a clear issue in our analysis. Additionally, we use a
Bayesian approach to analyze the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation for the
identified structures. We find that the distribution of slopes are broadly
distributed, mainly due to the limited dynamic range of our measured H2 mass
surface density, and being most consistent with super-linear relations. On the
other hand, when we use the Bayesian approach to analyze the K-S relation for a
uniform grid, the distributions of slopes is consistent with sub-linear
relations. On-arm regions tend to have higher star formation rates than
inter-arm regions. As in NGC 6946, in M101 we find regions where the star
formation efficiency shows marked peaks at specific galoctocentric radii. On

constraint-based and score-based. The constraint-based approach is able to
detect common causes of the observed variables but the use of independence
tests makes it less reliable. The score-based approach produces a result that
is easier to interpret as it also measures the reliability of the inferred
causal relationships, but it is unable to detect common confounders of the
observed variables. A drawback of both score-based and constrained-based
approaches is the inherent instability in structure estimation. With finite
samples small changes in the data can lead to completely different optimal
structures. The present work introduces a new hypothesis-free score-based
causal discovery algorithm, called stable specification search, that is robust
for finite samples based on recent advances in stability selection using
subsampling and selection algorithms. Structure search is performed over
Structural Equation Models. Our approach uses exploratory search but allows
incorporation of prior background knowledge. We validated our approach on one
simulated data set, which we compare to the known ground truth, and two

Unbounded-time reachability analysis that can cope with industrial-scale models

acceleration, a method for unbounded-time polyhedral reachability analysis for
linear systems. Existing variants of the method are restricted to closed
systems, i.e., dynamical models without inputs or non-determinism. In this
paper, we present an extension of abstract acceleration to linear loops with
inputs, which correspond to discrete-time LTI control systems under guard
conditions. The new method relies on a relaxation of the solution of the linear
dynamical equation that leads to a precise over-approximation of the set of
reachable states, which are evaluated using support functions. In order to
increase scalability, we use floating-point computations and ensure soundness
by interval arithmetic. Our experiments show that performance increases by
several orders of magnitude over alternative approaches in the literature. In
turn, this tremendous gain allows us to improve on precision by computing more
expensive abstractions. We outperform state-of-the-art tools for unbounded-time

the occurrence of radio loudness and of the fractional radio luminosity
function on the dynamical state of the hosting cluster. We studied the radio
properties of the BCGs in the Extended GMRT Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS). We
obtained a statistical sample of 59 BCGs, which was divided into two classes,
depending on the dynamical state of the host cluster, i.e. merging (M) and
relaxed (R). Among the 59 BCGs, 28 are radio-loud, and 31 are radio--quiet. The
radio-loud sources are located favourably located in relaxed clusters (71\%),
while the reverse is true for the radio-quiet BCGs, mostly located in merging
systems (81\%). The fractional radio luminosity function (RLF) for the BCGs is
considerably higher for BCGs in relaxed clusters, where the total fraction of
radio loudness reaches almost 90\%, to be compared to the $\sim$30\% in merging
clusters. For relaxed clusters, we found a positive correlation between the
radio power of the BCGs and the strength of the cool core, consistent with
previous studies on local samples. Our study suggests that the radio loudness
of the BCGs strongly depends on the cluster dynamics, their fraction being
considerably higher in relaxed clusters. We compared our results with similar

show that the coupling of the lightest KK graviton with the SM matter fields
gets a significant suppression due to the inclusion of the backreaction of the

weakens the signals from RS scenario in collider experiments which in turn
explains the non-visibility of KK graviton in colliders. Thus we show that the

Inertial-range asymptotic behavior is studied by means of the field theoretic

of the signal is determined by consumption through cells. In contrast to
related Keller-Segel-type problems with scalar sensitivities, in presence of
such tensor-valued sensitivities this system in general apparently does not
possess any useful gradient-like structure. Accordingly, its analysis needs to
be based on new types of a priori bounds.
  Using a spatio-temporal $L^2$ estimate for the gradient of the logarithm of
the cell density as a starting point, we derive a series of compactness
properties of solutions to suitably regularized versions of the system.
Motivated by these, we develop a generalized solution concept which requires
solutions to satisfy very mild regularity hypotheses only.
  On the basis of the above compactness properties, it is finally shown that
within this framework, under a mild growth assumption on the sensitivity matrix
and for all sufficiently regular nonnegative initial data, the corresponding
initial-boundary value problem possesses at least one global generalized
solution.
  This extends known results which in the case of such general matrix-valued
sensitivities provide statements on global existence only in the
two-dimensional setting and under the additional restriction that the initial
signal concentration be suitably small.

work by Costa and Muniz who study damping numerically by direct calculation of
the dynamical transverse spin susceptibility in the presence of spin-orbit

$Z$ decay muons are replaced by $\tau$ leptons from simulated

calorimeter cells. The $\tau$ lepton kinematics are derived from the kinematics
of the original muons. Thus, only the well-understood decays of the $Z$ boson

particularly relevant for Higgs boson searches and analyses in $\tau\tau$ final

an asymptotic analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations. A multi-scale analysis
is performed in order to take into account that the velocity of the sediment
layer is smaller than the one of the fluid layer. This leads us to consider a
shallow water type system for the fluid layer and a lubrication Reynolds
equation for the sediment one. This deduction provides some improvements with
respect to the classical Saint-Venant-Exner model: (i) the deduced model has an
associated energy. Moreover, it allows us to explain why classical models do
not have an associated energy and how to modify them in order to recover a
model with this property. (ii) The model incorporates naturally a necessary
modification that must be taken into account in order to be applied to
arbitrarily sloping beds. Furthermore, we show that this modification is
different of the ones considered classically, and that it coincides with a
classical one only if the solution has a constant free surface. (iii) The
deduced solid transport discharge naturally depends on the thickness of the
moving sediment layer, what allows to ensure sediment mass conservation.
Moreover, we include a simplified version of the model for the case of
quasi-stationary regimes. Some of these simplified models correspond to the
generalization of classical ones such as Meyer-Peter$\&$M\""uller and
Ashida-Michiue models. Three numerical tests are presented to study the
evolution of a dune for several definition of the repose angle, to see the
influence of the proposed definition of the effective shear stress in

effectively handling the wild dynamics, that is, the allele frequency prior to

evolution is highly sensitive to it, moreover it is extremely difficult to
measure in the agricultural field. In this paper we propose a model for weed
control that handles the allele frequency in a direct manner, grounded on the
very dynamics of the weed life cycle, with no need of a priori distributions
nor the use of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The proposed model is individual
based, stochastic, and considers some phenomena like the relative fitnesses and
mutation that are prominent in the resistance dynamics without herbicide. A
case study is presented for the herbicide nicosulfuron in a field with the weed
Bidens pilosa. Another two models having a standard deterministic dynamics are

the Dark Matter (DM) contribution to the emission observed in the different

different non-thermal models to study the different regions, and we compare our
results with the available observations in the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray
bands, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect data. We find that the radio
emission coming from the main DM subhalo can be produced by secondary electrons
produced by DM annihilations. In this scenario there are however some open
issues, like the difficulty to explain the observed flux at 8.8 GHz, the high
value of the required annihilation cross section, and the lack of observed
emission coming from the minor DM subhalo. We also find that part of the radio
emission originated by DM annihilation could be associated with a slightly
extended radio source present near the main DM subhalo. Regarding the baryonic
subhalos, the radio measurements do not allow to discriminate between a primary
or secondary origin of the electrons, while the SZ effect data point towards a
primary origin for the non-thermal electrons in the Main Subcluster. We
conclude that in order to better constrain the properties of the DM subhalos,
it is important to perform detailed measurements of the radio emission in the
regions where the DM halos have their peaks, and that the separation of the
complex radio halo in different subhalos is a promising technique to understand
the properties of each specific subhalo.

exactly known geometries, e.g. as domains of forward problems modeled by
partial differential equations. This makes it desirable to use methods which
are robust with respect to perturbed or not well resolved domains, and which
allow for efficient discretizations not resolving any fine detail of those
geometries. For forward problems in partial differential equations methods
based on diffuse interface representations gained strong attention in the last
years, but so far they have not been considered systematically for inverse
problems. In this work we introduce a diffuse domain method as a tool for the
solution of variational inverse problems. As a particular example we study ECG
inversion in further detail. ECG inversion is a linear inverse source problem
with boundary measurements governed by an anisotropic diffusion equation, which
naturally cries for solutions under changing geometries, namely the beating
heart.
  We formulate a regularization strategy using Tikhonov regularization and,
using standard source conditions, we prove convergence rates. A special
property of our approach is that not only operator perturbations are introduced
by the diffuse domain method, but more important we have to deal with
topologies which depend on a parameter $\eps$ in the diffuse domain method,
i.e. we have to deal with $\eps$-dependent forward operators and
$\eps$-dependent norms. In particular the appropriate function spaces for the
unknown and the data depend on $\eps$. This prevents to apply some standard
convergence techniques for inverse problems, in particular interpreting the
perturbations as data errors in the original problem does not yield suitable
results. We consequently develop a novel approach based on saddle-point
problems.

helium reionization is mostly driven by the contribution of energetic quasars
at $z<6$, we study here how helium reionization proceeds if there is an
additional contribution due to the annihilation of dark matter. We explore the
effects of different dark matter profiles for the dark matter clumping factor,
which can significantly enhance the annihilation rate at late times. We find
that the presence of dark matter annihilation enhances the He$^{++}$ abundance
at early stages where it would be zero within the standard model, and it can
further increase during structure formation, reflecting the increase of the
dark matter clumping factor. The latter is, however, degenerate with the
build-up of the quasar contribution, and we therefore expect no significant
changes at late times. We expect that future studies of the He$^+$ Lyman
$\alpha$ forest may help to assess whether the evolution is consistent with the
contribution from quasars alone, or if an additional component may be required.

rigorous mathematical approach for solving the full nonlinear inverse problem
directly, i.e. without iterations. It is based on a low-pass filtering in the

inherently smoothed leading to a loss of edge distinction. In this paper, a
novel approach that combines the rigor of the D-bar approach with the
edge-preserving nature of Total Variation regularization is presented. The
method also includes a data-driven contrast adjustment technique guided by the
key functions (CGO solutions) of the D-bar method. The new TV-Enhanced D-bar
Method produces reconstructions with sharper edges and improved contrast while
still solving the full nonlinear problem. This is achieved by using the
TV-induced edges to increase the truncation radius of the scattering data in
the nonlinear frequency domain thereby increasing the radius of the low pass
filter. The algorithm is tested on numerically simulated noisy EIT data and
demonstrates significant improvements in edge preservation and contrast which
can be highly valuable for absolute EIT imaging.

cannot remove often provide rich information beyond the linear independent
components. It would thus be very useful to estimate the dependency structure
from data. While such models have been proposed, they usually concentrated on
higher-order correlations such as energy (square) correlations. Yet, linear
correlations are a most fundamental and informative form of dependency in many
real data sets. Linear correlations are usually completely removed by ICA and
related methods, so they can only be analyzed by developing new methods which
explicitly allow for linearly correlated components. In this paper, we propose
a probabilistic model of linear non-Gaussian components which are allowed to
have both linear and energy correlations. The precision matrix of the linear
components is assumed to be randomly generated by a higher-order process and
explicitly parametrized by a parameter matrix. The estimation of the parameter
matrix is shown to be particularly simple because using score matching, the
objective function is a quadratic form. Using simulations with artificial data,
we demonstrate that the proposed method improves identifiability of
non-Gaussian components by simultaneously learning their correlation structure.
Applications on simulated complex cells with natural image input, as well as
spectrograms of natural audio data show that the method finds new kinds of

  There are four central critical regions for the triple product $L$-functions
and two opposite settings, according to the sign of the functional equation. In
the first case, three of these regions are of interpolation, having positive
sign; they are called the unbalanced regions and one gets three $p$% -adic
$L$-functions, one for each region of interpolation (this is the
Harris-Tilouine setting). In the other setting there is only one region of
interpolation, called the balanced region. An especially interesting feature of
our construction is that we get three different $p$-adic triple product $% L
$-functions with the same (balanced) region of interpolation. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first case where an interpolation problem
is solved on a single critical region by different $p$-adic $L$% -functions at
the same time. This is possible due to the structure of the Euler-like factors
at $p$ arising in the interpolation formulas, the vanishing of which are
related to the dimensions of certain Nekovar period spaces. Our triple product
$p$-adic $L$-functions arise as specializations of $p$-adic period integrals
interpolating normalizations of the local archimedean period integrals. The
latter encode information about classical representation theoretic branching
laws. The main step in our construction of $p$-adic period integrals is showing
that these branching laws vary in a $% p$-adic analytic fashion. This relies
crucially on the Ash-Stevens theory of highest weight representations over

conducted which reveals the role of van der Waals attraction. It is shown that
the prediction of crystal structure of metal tellurohalides is systematically
improved thanks to the inclusion of van der Waals dispersion. It is found for
BiTeI and AuTeI that the energy versus volume curve is anomalously flat in the
vicinity of equilibrium volume and the calculated equation of state has an
excessively steep slope in the low-pressure region; these are also fixed in the
dispersion-corrected calculations. Analysis based on the computation of the
volume and axial compressibilities shows that predicting the anisotropy of
BiTeI via the semilocal calculations yields an unrealistic result, whereas the
results of dispersion-corrected calculations agree with the experimental
compressibility data. Our calculations render that BiTeI (AuTeI) is a narrow
band gap semiconductor with Rashba-type spin splitting at the band edges (with
an indirect band gap) while PdTeI is a metal with relatively low density of
states at the Fermi level. The band gaps of BiTeI and AuTeI obtained via
semilocal (dispersion-corrected) calculations are found to be greater (smaller)
than the respective experimental values, which is against (in line with) the
expected trend. Similarly, the Rashba parameters of BiTeI are bracketed by the
respective values obtained via semilocal and dispersion-corrected calculations.
Excellent agreement with the experimental Rashba parameters is obtained via
interpolation of the calculated (semilocal and dispersion-corrected) values.

state of the nodes have attracted much attention. One simple case of such an
adaptive dynamics is a model of social networks in which individuals are
typically comfortable with a certain number of contacts, i.e., preferred
degrees. This paper is partly a review of earlier work of single homogeneous
systems and ones with two interacting networks, and partly a presentation of
some new results. In general, the dynamics does not obey detailed balance and
the stationary distributions are not known analytically. A particular limit of
the latter is a system of extreme introverts and extroverts - the XIE model.
Remarkably, in this case, the detailed balance condition is satisfied, the
exact distribution and an effective Hamiltonian can be found explicitly.
Further, the model exhibits a phase transition in which the total number of
links in the system - a macroscopically interesting quantity, displays an
extreme Thouless effect. We show that in the limit of large populations and
away from the transition, the model reduces to one with non-interacting agents
of the majority subgroup. We determine the nature of fluctuations near the
transition. We also introduce variants of the model where the agents show
preferential attachment or detachment. There are significant changes to the
degree distributions in the steady state, some of which can be understood by
theoretical arguments and some remain to be explored. Many intriguing questions
are posed, providing some food for thought and avenues for future research.

no mass inflation. Therefore, we conclude that to induce a Cauchy horizon and

performs a Bayesian-scoring greedy hill-climbing search to orient the edges.
The algorithm is based on divide-and-conquer constraint-based subroutines to
learn the local structure around a target variable. We conduct two series of
experimental comparisons of H2PC against Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC), which is
currently the most powerful state-of-the-art algorithm for Bayesian network
structure learning. First, we use eight well-known Bayesian network benchmarks
with various data sizes to assess the quality of the learned structure returned
by the algorithms. Our extensive experiments show that H2PC outperforms MMHC in
terms of goodness of fit to new data and quality of the network structure with
respect to the true dependence structure of the data. Second, we investigate
H2PC's ability to solve the multi-label learning problem. We provide
theoretical results to characterize and identify graphically the so-called
minimal label powersets that appear as irreducible factors in the joint
distribution under the faithfulness condition. The multi-label learning problem
is then decomposed into a series of multi-class classification problems, where
each multi-class variable encodes a label powerset. H2PC is shown to compare
favorably to MMHC in terms of global classification accuracy over ten
multi-label data sets covering different application domains. Overall, our
experiments support the conclusions that local structural learning with H2PC in
the form of local neighborhood induction is a theoretically well-motivated and
empirically effective learning framework that is well suited to multi-label
learning. The source code (in R) of H2PC as well as all data sets used for the

infrastructure and without centralized network management. Traditional
techniques of routing are not well adapted. Indeed, their lack of reactivity
with respect to the variability of network changes makes them difficult to use.
Moreover, conserving energy is a critical concern in the design of routing
protocols for ad hoc networks, because most mobile nodes operate with limited
battery capacity, and the energy depletion of a node affects not only the node
itself but also the overall network lifetime. In all proposed single-path
routing schemes a new path-discovery process is required once a path failure is
detected, and this process causes delay and wastage of node resources. A
multipath routing scheme is an alternative to maximize the network lifetime. In
this paper, we propose an energy-efficient multipath routing protocol, called
AOMR-LM (Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Routing with Lifetime Maximization), which
preserves the residual energy of nodes and balances the consumed energy to
increase the network lifetime. To achieve this goal, we used the residual
energy of nodes for calculating the node energy level. The multipath selection
mechanism uses this energy level to classify the paths. Two parameters are
analyzed: the energy threshold beta and the coefficient alpha. These parameters
are required to classify the nodes and to ensure the preservation of node
energy. Our protocol improves the performance of mobile ad hoc networks by
prolonging the lifetime of the network. This novel protocol has been compared
with other protocols: AOMDV and ZD-AOMDV. The protocol performance has been
evaluated in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, and end-to-end
delay.

that while hidden order provides an environment for superconductivity and

nonlinear plate strongly coupled to a convected wave equation on the half
space. In the absence of imposed energy dissipation the plate dynamics converge
to a compact and finite dimensional set [16,17]. With a sufficiently large
velocity feedback control on the structure we show that the full flow-plate
system exhibits strong convergence to the stationary set in the natural energy
topology. In doing so, we demonstrate the existence of an exponential attractor
for the plate dynamics. That the exponential attractor exhibits additional
smoothness is the technical crux of the main result. This property cannot be
taken for granted, as exponential attractors are often compact but not
necessarily smooth (in contrast with global maximal attractors).
  Our result implies that flutter (a periodic or chaotic end behavior) can be
eliminated (in subsonic flows) with sufficient frictional damping in the
structure. While such a result has been proved in the past for regularized
plate models (with rotational inertia terms or thermal considerations

  Matrices and Statistics,2015",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tensor-valued data are being encountered increasingly more commonly, in the
biological, natural as well as the social sciences. The learning of the unknown
model parameter vector given such data, involves covariance modelling of such
data, though this can be difficult owing to the high-dimensional nature of the
data, where the numerical challenge of such modelling can only be compounded by
the largeness of the available data set. Assuming such data to be modelled
using a correspondingly high-dimensional Gaussian Process (${\cal
  GP}$), the joint density of a finite set of such data sets is then a tensor
normal distribution, with density parametrised by a mean tensor
$\boldsymbol{M}$ (that is of the same dimensionality as the $k$-tensor valued
observable), and the $k$ covariance matrices
$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_1,...,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k$. When aiming to model the
covariance structure of the data, we need to estimate/learn
$\{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_1,...,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k \}$ and $\boldsymbol{M}$,
given tha data. We present a new method in which we perform such covariance
modelling by first expressing the probability density of the available data
sets as tensor-normal. We then invoke appropriate priors on these unknown
parameters and express the posterior of the unknowns given the data. We sample
from this posterior using an appropriate variant of Metropolis Hastings. Since
the classical MCMC is time and resource intensive in high-dimensional state
spaces, we use an efficient variant of the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm--Transformation based MCMC--employed to perform efficient sampling
from a high-dimensional state space. Once we perform the covariance modelling
of such a data set, we will learn the unknown model parameter vector at which a
measured (or test) data set has been obtained, given the already modelled data
(training data), augmented by the test data.

in the asymptotic limit where the external radiation from the broad line region

includes BLR radiation. As its energy density in the emission region depends on
$\delta$ and the region's distance from the galactic center, we use the EM
cascade to determine a minimum distance for each value of $\delta$. We
complement the EM cascade constraint with one derived from variability

electron- and hole-bands and its relation to the superconductivity have been
seen as a key factor in unveiling the mechanism of high-Tc superconductors. So
far, the occurrence of electrons and holes in n-type copper oxides has been
achieved by chemical doping, pressure, and/or deoxygenation. However, the
observed electronic properties are blurred by the concomitant effects such as
change of lattice structure, disorder, etc. Here, we report on successful
tuning the electronic band structure of n-type Pr2-xCexCuO4 (x = 0.15)
ultrathin films, via the electric double layer transistor technique. Abnormal
transport properties, such as multiple sign reversals of Hall resistivity in
normal and mixed states, have been revealed within an electrostatic field in
range of -2 V to +2 V, as well as varying the temperature and magnetic field.
In the mixed state, the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity invokes the
contribution of both electron and hole-bands as well as the energy dependent
density of states near the Fermi level. The two-band model can also describe
the normal state transport properties well, whereas the carrier concentrations
of electrons and holes are always enhanced or depressed simultaneously in
electric fields. This is in contrast to the scenario of Fermi surface
reconstruction by antiferromagnetism, where an anti-correlation between
electrons and holes is commonly expected. Our findings paint the picture where
Coulomb repulsion plays an important role in the evolution of the electronic
states in n-type cuprate superconductors.

behavior of a system, is often insufficient for practical purposes. Observing
quantitative information is of interest, e.g. for the proper calibration of a
battery or a real-time scheduler. Historically, the focus has been on
quantities in a continuous domain, but recent years showed a renewed interest
for discrete quantitative domains.
  Cost Linear Temporal Logic (CLTL) is a quantitative extension of classical
LTL. It integrates into a nice theory developed in the past few years that
extends the qualitative setting, with counterparts in terms of logics, automata
and algebraic structure. We propose a practical usage of this logics for
model-checking purposes. A CLTL formula defines a function from infinite words
to integers. Finding the bounds of such a function over a given set of words
can be seen as an extension of LTL universal and existential model-checking. We
propose a CEGAR-like algorithm to find these bounds by relying on classical LTL
model-checking, and use B\""{u}chi automata with counters to implement it. This
method constitutes a first step towards the practical use of such a discrete
quantitative logic.

focus on optomechanics in the extremely-large-amplitude regime in which a

oscillation. We explicitly show that the mechanical resonator can present
self-sustained oscillations in a novel way with limit cycles in the shape of
sawtooth-edged ellipses and exhibit dynamical multistability. By analyzing the
mechanical oscillation process and the accompanied variation of the optical
cavity occupation, we develop an energy-balanced condition to ensure the
stability of self-sustained oscillation. The effect of the mechanical
nonlinearities on the dynamics of the mechanical resonator is also
investigated.

structures within single climatic fields directly on or parallel to the Earth's
surface. Here, we develop a novel approach of node weighted coupled network
measures to study correlations between ocean and atmosphere in the Northern
Hemisphere extratropics and construct 18 coupled climate networks, each
consisting of two subnetworks. In all cases, one subnetwork represents monthly
sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies, while the other is based on the
monthly geopotential height (HGT) of isobaric surfaces at different pressure
levels covering the troposphere as well as the lower stratosphere. The weighted
cross-degree density proves to be consistent with the leading coupled pattern
obtained from maximum covariance analysis. Network measures of higher order
allow for a further analysis of the correlation structure between the two
fields and consistently indicate that in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics
the ocean is correlated with the atmosphere in a hierarchical fashion such that
large areas of the ocean surface correlate with multiple statistically
dissimilar regions in the atmosphere. Ultimately we show that, this observed
hierarchy is linked to large-scale atmospheric variability patterns, such as
the Pacific North American pattern, forcing the ocean on monthly time scales.

turns out that the dGRT black hole solutions includes the known solutions to

the graviton mass in massive gravity naturally generates the cosmological

thermodynamical stability. It turns out that the presence of the graviton mass
completely changes the black hole thermodynamics, and it can provide the
Hawking-Page phase transition which is also true for the obtained charged black
holes. Interestingly, the entropy of a black hole is unaffected and still obeys
area law. In particular, our results, in the limit $m_g \rightarrow 0$, reduced

Reservoirs can be seen as socio-environmental systems at risk of regime shifts,
characteristic of tipping point transitions. We analyze data from stored water,
rainfall, and water inflow and outflow in the main reservoir serving the
metropolitan area of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, by means of indicators of critical
regime shifts, and find a strong signal of a transition. We furthermore build a
mathematical model that gives a mechanistic view of the dynamics and
demonstrates that alternative stable states are an expected property of water
reservoirs. We also build a stochastic version of this model that fits well to
the data. These results highlight the broader aspect that reservoir management
must account for their intrinsic bistability, and should benefit from dynamical
systems theory. Our case study illustrates the catastrophic consequences of
failing to do so.

our approach implies, in a pretty simple manner, that every horizon of

quantum gravity provides an explanation both to the presence and the smallness
