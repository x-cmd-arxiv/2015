its lyrical and audio features. Lyrical features are generated by segmentation
of lyrics during the process of data extraction. ANEW and WordNet knowledge is
then incorporated to compute Valence and Arousal values. In addition to this,
linguistic association rules are applied to ensure that the issue of ambiguity
is properly addressed. Audio features are used to supplement the lyrical ones
and include attributes like energy, tempo, and danceability. These features are
extracted from The Echo Nest, a widely used music intelligence platform.
Construction of training and test sets is done on the basis of social tags
extracted from the last.fm website. The classification is done by applying
feature weighting and stepwise threshold reduction on the k-Nearest Neighbors
algorithm to provide fuzziness in the classification.

red galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main galaxy sample. Because
this sample does not have multiple spectra at various radii in a single galaxy,
we measure these gradients statistically. We separate galaxies into stellar
mass bins, stack their spectra in redshift bins, and calculate the measured
absorption line indices in projected annuli by differencing spectra in
neighboring redshift bins. After determining the line indices, we use stellar
population modeling from the EZ\_Ages software to calculate ages,
metallicities, and abundance ratios within each annulus. Our data covers the
central regions of these galaxies, out to slightly higher than $1 R_{e}$. We
find detectable gradients in metallicity and relatively shallow gradients in
abundance ratios, similar to results found for direct measurements of
individual galaxies. The gradients are only weakly dependent on stellar mass,
and this dependence is well-correlated with the change of $R_e$ with mass.
Based on this data, we report mean equivalent widths, metallicities, and
abundance ratios as a function of mass and velocity dispersion for SDSS
early-type galaxies, for fixed apertures of 2.5 kpc and of 0.5 $R_e$.

They originate
from intestinal crypts, glands that descend from the intestinal lumen into the
underlying connective tissue. Normal crypts are thought to exist in a dynamic
equilibrium where the rate of cell production at the base of a crypt is matched
by that of loss at the top. Understanding how genetic alterations accumulate
and proceed to disrupt this dynamic equilibrium is fundamental to understanding
the origins of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer emerges from the
interaction of biological processes that span several spatial scales, from
mutations that cause inappropriate intracellular responses to changes at the
cell/tissue level, such as uncontrolled proliferation and altered motility and
adhesion. Multiscale mathematical modelling can provide insight into the
spatiotemporal organisation of such a complex, highly regulated and dynamic
system. Moreover, the aforementioned challenges are inherent to the multiscale
modelling of biological tissue more generally. In this review we describe the
mathematical approaches that have been applied to investigate multiscale
aspects of crypt behaviour, highlighting a number of model predictions that
have since been validated experimentally. We also discuss some of the key
mathematical and computational challenges associated with the multiscale
modelling approach. We conclude by discussing recent efforts to derive
coarse-grained descriptions of such models, which may offer one way of reducing
the computational cost of simulation by leveraging well-established tools of
mathematical analysis to address key problems in multiscale modelling.

an oscillator such that the qubit is protected against small shifts

processes of low rate can be expanded into small shift errors. The qubit space
is defined as an eigenspace of two mutually commuting displacement operators
$S_p$ and $S_q$ which act as large shifts/translations in phase space. We
propose and analyze the approximate creation of these qubit states by coupling
the oscillator to a sequence of ancilla qubits. This preparation of the states
uses the idea of phase estimation where the phase of the displacement operator,
say $S_p$, is approximately determined. We consider several possible forms of
phase estimation. We analyze the performance of repeated and adapative phase
estimation as the simplest and experimentally most viable schemes given a
realistic upper-limit on the number of photons in the oscillator. We propose a
detailed physical implementation of this protocol using the dispersive coupling
between a transmon ancilla qubit and a cavity mode in circuit-QED. We provide
an estimate that in a current experimental set-up one can prepare a good code
state from a squeezed vacuum state using $8$ rounds of adapative phase

out when looking at it. The trick is achieved by replicating a vertical strip
that sets a basic two-dimensional pattern with disparity shifts that encode a
three-dimensional scene. It is of interest to explore the dependency between
the ease of perceiving depth in autostereograms and the choice of the basic
pattern used for generating them. In this work we confirm a theory proposed by
Bruckstein et al. to explain the process of autostereographic depth perception,
providing a measure for the ease of ""locking into"" the depth profile, based on
the spectral properties of the basic pattern used. We report the results of
three sets of psychophysical experiments using autostereograms generated from
two-dimensional random noise patterns having power spectra of the form
$1/f^\beta$. The experiments were designed to test the ability of human
subjects to identify smooth, low resolution surfaces, as well as detail, in the
form of higher resolution objects in the depth profile, and to determine limits
in identifying small objects as a function of their size. In accordance with
the theory, we discover a significant advantage of the $1/f$ noise pattern
(pink noise) for fast depth lock-in and fine detail detection, showing that
such patterns are optimal choices for autostereogram design. Validating the
theoretical model predictions strengthens its underlying assumptions, and
contributes to a better understanding of the visual system's binocular
disparity mechanisms.

framework of initially stressed solids irrespective of how this stress formed.
An ideal way to do this is to write the free energy density $\Psi=
\Psi(\boldsymbol F, \boldsymbol {\tau})$ in terms of initial stress
$\boldsymbol \tau$ and the elastic deformation gradient $\boldsymbol F$. In
this paper we present a new constitutive condition for initially stressed
materials, which we call the initial stress symmetry (ISS). We focus on two
consequences of this symmetry. First we examine how ISS restricts the free
energy density $\Psi = \Psi (\boldsymbol F, \boldsymbol \tau) $ and present two
examples of $\Psi (\boldsymbol F, \boldsymbol \tau)$ that satisfy ISS. Second
we show that the initial stress can be derived from the Cauchy stress and the

biomechanics and calculate the optimal Cauchy stress within an artery subjected
to internal pressure. We then use ISS to derive the optimal target residual
stress for the material to achieve after remodelling.

Finally, we show that the argument previously used to rule out the

1-$\mathbf{k}$ structure in which spin fluctuations on ordered and disordered

In order to effectively suppress starlight for exoplanet imaging applications,

established the utility of pupil-plane masks (both
non-redundant/sparse-aperture and generally asymmetric aperture masks) for
wavefront sensing. Here we show how a sparse aperture mask (SAM) can be
integrated with a coronagraph to measure low-order, differential phase
aberrations. Starlight rejected by the coronagraph's focal plane stop is
collimated to a relay pupil, where the mask forms an interference fringe
pattern on a subsequent detector. Our numerical Fourier propagation models show
that the information encoded in the fringe intensity distortions is sufficient
to accurately discriminate and estimate Zernike phase modes extending from
tip-tilt up to radial degree $n=5$, with amplitude up to $\lambda/20$ RMS. The
SAM sensor can be integrated with both Lyot and shaped pupil coronagraphs (SPC)
at no detriment to the science beam quality. We characterize the reconstruction
accuracy and the performance under low flux/short exposure time conditions, and
place it in context of other coronagraph wavefront sensing schemes.

discrete data, even though a few approaches for hybrid SRL models have been
proposed that combine numerical and discrete variables. In this paper we
distinguish numerical random variables for which a probability distribution is
defined by the model from numerical input variables that are only used for
conditioning the distribution of discrete response variables. We show how
numerical input relations can very easily be used in the Relational Bayesian
Network framework, and that existing inference and learning methods need only
minor adjustments to be applied in this generalized setting. The resulting
framework provides natural relational extensions of classical probabilistic
models for categorical data. We demonstrate the usefulness of RBN models with
numeric input relations by several examples.
  In particular, we use the augmented RBN framework to define probabilistic
models for multi-relational (social) networks in which the probability of a
link between two nodes depends on numeric latent feature vectors associated
with the nodes. A generic learning procedure can be used to obtain a
maximum-likelihood fit of model parameters and latent feature values for a
variety of models that can be expressed in the high-level RBN representation.
Specifically, we propose a model that allows us to interpret learned latent
feature values as community centrality degrees by which we can identify nodes
that are central for one community, that are hubs between communities, or that
are isolated nodes. In a multi-relational setting, the model also provides a
characterization of how different relations are associated with each community.

large masses, with a very rapid crossover to classical behaviour at an energy

continues to favor a brown dwarf companion about 12 AU from the eclipsing

curves are solved simultaneously along with white dwarf and red dwarf RVs from
the literature, uvby data, the MOST mission light curve, and 40 years of

balance among the various datasets. Timewise variation of modeled starspots
allows unified solution of multiple data eras. Light curve amplitudes strongly
suggest decreasing spottedness from 1976 to about 1980, followed by
approximately constant spot coverage from 1981 to 2005. An explanation is
proposed for lack of noticeable variation in 1981 light curves, in terms of
competition between spot and tidal variations. Photometric spectroscopic

R-band and H-alpha imaging for a volume-limited subset of the 21-cm ALFALFA
survey. We identify eight starbursts based on H-alpha equivalent width and six
with enhanced star formation relative to the main sequence. Both starbursts and
non-starbursts have similar HI to stellar mass ratios (MHI/M*), which suggests
that feedback is not depleting the starbursts' HI. Consequently, the starbursts
do have shorter HI depletion times (t_dep), implying more efficient HI-to-H2
conversion. While major mergers likely drive this enhanced efficiency in some
starbursts, the lowest mass starbursts may experience periodic bursts,
consistent with enhanced scatter in t_dep at low M*. Two starbursts appear to
be pre-coalescence mergers; their elevated MHI/M* suggest that HI-to-H2
conversion is still ongoing at this stage. By comparing with the GASS sample,
we find that t_dep anti-correlates with stellar surface density for disks,
while spheroids show no such trend. Among early-type galaxies, t_dep does not
correlate with bulge-to-disk ratio; instead, the gas distribution may determine
the star formation efficiency. Finally, the weak connection between galaxies'
specific star formation rates and MHI/M* contrasts with the well-known
correlation between MHI/M* and color. We show that dust extinction can explain
the HI-color trend, which may arise from the relationship between M*, MHI, and
metallicity.

find that the physics of the Majorana bands is well described by tight binding
models of Majorana fermions coupled to a static Z2 gauge field with a
non-trivial gauge flux through each plaquette, in accord with expectations
based on very general arguments. In the case of the Fu-Kane model we also find
that, irrespective of the lattice geometry, the Majorana band becomes
completely flat at the so called neutrality point (chemical potential
coincident with the Dirac point) where the model exhibits an extra chiral
symmetry. In this limit the low energy physics will be dominated by
four-fermion interaction terms which are permitted by symmetries and may arise
from the Coulomb interaction between the constituent electron degrees of

of locality in distributed graph algorithms. This paper presents an extremely
simple randomized algorithm providing a near-optimal local complexity for this
problem, which incidentally, when combined with some recent techniques, also
leads to a near-optimal global complexity.
  Classical algorithms of Luby [STOC'85] and Alon, Babai and Itai [JALG'86]
provide the global complexity guarantee that, with high probability, all nodes
terminate after $O(\log n)$ rounds. In contrast, our initial focus is on the
local complexity, and our main contribution is to provide a very simple
algorithm guaranteeing that each particular node $v$ terminates after $O(\log
\mathsf{deg}(v)+\log 1/\epsilon)$ rounds, with probability at least
$1-\epsilon$. The guarantee holds even if the randomness outside $2$-hops
neighborhood of $v$ is determined adversarially. This degree-dependency is
optimal, due to a lower bound of Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer [PODC'04].
  Interestingly, this local complexity smoothly transitions to a global
complexity: by adding techniques of Barenboim, Elkin, Pettie, and Schneider
[FOCS'12, arXiv: 1202.1983v3], we get a randomized MIS algorithm with a high
probability global complexity of $O(\log \Delta) + 2^{O(\sqrt{\log \log n})}$,
where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree. This improves over the $O(\log^2
\Delta) + 2^{O(\sqrt{\log \log n})}$ result of Barenboim et al., and gets close
to the $\Omega(\min\{\log \Delta, \sqrt{\log n}\})$ lower bound of Kuhn et al.
  Corollaries include improved algorithms for MIS in graphs of upper-bounded
arboricity, or lower-bounded girth, for Ruling Sets, for MIS in the Local
Computation Algorithms (LCA) model, and a faster distributed algorithm for the
Lov\'asz Local Lemma.

M_Jup to 60 M_Jup follow a tight linear relationship with no distinguishing
feature to separate the low mass end (giant planets) from the high mass end

seems arbitrary. We propose a new definition of giant planets based simply on
changes in the slope of the log $M$ versus log rho relationship. By this
criterion, objects with masses less than ~ 0.3 M_Jup are low mass planets,
either icy or rocky. Giant planets cover the mass range 0.3 M_Jup to 60 M_Jup.

narrower and peaking at smaller separations than the distribution for
solar-type binaries. This is often interpreted to mean that M-dwarfs constitute
a continuous transition from brown dwarfs (BDs) to stars. Here a prediction for
the M-dwarf separation distribution is presented, using a dynamical population
synthesis (DPS) model in which ""star-like"" binaries with late-type primaries
($\lesssim1.5 M_{\rm sun}$) follow universal initial distribution functions and
are dynamically processed in their birth embedded clusters. A separate
""BD-like"" population has both its own distribution functions for binaries and
initial mass function (IMF), which overlaps in mass with the IMF for stars.
Combining these two formation modes results in a peak on top of a wider
separation distribution for late M-dwarfs consistent with the late ASTRALUX
sample. The DPS separation distribution for early M-dwarfs shows no such peak
and is in agreement with the M-dwarfs in Multiples (MinMS) data. We note that
the latter survey is potentially in tension with the early ASTRALUX data.
Concluding, the ASTRALUX and MinMS data are unable to unambiguously distinguish
whether or not BDs are a continuous extension of the stellar IMF. Future
observational efforts are needed to fully answer this interesting question. The
DPS model predicts that binaries outside the sensitivity range of the ASTRALUX
survey remain to be detected. For application to future data, we present a
means to observationally measure the overlap of the putative BD-like branch and
the stellar branch. We discuss the meaning of universal star formation and

shape of the total gamma-ray flux distribution is very sensitive to the
contribution of a dark matter component, allowing us to forecast promising
one-point upper limits on the annihilation cross section. We show that by using

increases up to $\sim25\deg$, the maximum M$_{sp}$ is $\sim1\%$ of the disk
mass independently in this case of morphological type. For values larger than
these limits, spiral arms would likely act as transient features. Regarding the
limits posed by extreme chaotic behavior, we find a strong restriction on the
maximum plausible values of spiral arms parameters on disk galaxies beyond
which, chaotic behavior becomes pervasive. We find that for $i$ smaller than
$\sim20\deg$, $\sim25\deg$, $\sim30\deg$, for Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies,

is $\sim1\%$, $\sim2\%$, $\sim3\%$ of the mass of the disk. Beyond these
values, chaos dominates phase space, destroying the main periodic and the
neighboring quasi-periodic orbits.

four-dimensional physical models.
  Here, we show that a Randall-Sundrum brane universe can be regarded as a
vacuum solution of Chern-Simons gravity in five-dimensional spacetime, with non
vanishing torsion along the dimension perpendicular to the brane. Linearized
perturbations around this solution not only exist, but behave as standard
gravitational waves on a four-dimensional Minkowski background. In the
non-perturbative regime, the solution leads to a four-dimensional ""cosmological

brane.
  Interestingly, the fact that the solution admits nontrivial linear
perturbations seems to be related to an often neglected property of the
Randall-Sundrum spacetime: that it is a group manifold, or, more precisely, two
identical group manifolds glued together along the brane. The gravitational
theory is then built around this fact, adding the Lorentz generators and one
scalar generator needed to close the algebra. In this way, a conjecture
emerges: a spacetime that is also a group manifold can be regarded as the
ground state of a Chern-Simons theory for an appropriate Lie algebra.

bulge stellar velocity dispersion. More compact, high-dispersion galaxies need

a conserved parity, under which the top partner is odd and all SM states are
even. In this case, decays of top partners may involve new particle-odd
scalars, leading to signal topologies more commonly associated with
supersymmetry, either with or without R-parity conservation. We study a
simplified model in which this possibility is realized, and estimate the bounds
on the top partner mass in this model implied by LHC searches for
supersymmetry. We find that the bounds can be significantly weaker than in the
conventional top partner decay scenario. For example, if the new parity is
exact, a 500 GeV top partner is allowed as long as the lightest parity-odd
scalar mass is between 325 and 500 GeV. The lower allowed top partner mass
reduces the need for fine-tuning in the Higgs mass parameter, compared to the

First, we fit the $\gamma$-ray spectrum with a two-component photon model,
namely synchrotron+blackbody, and then fit the recovered evolution of the
synchrotron $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak to an analytic model derived considering the
emission of a relativistic blast-wave expanding into an external medium. The
prediction of the model for the $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak evolution matches well with
the observations. We observe the blast-wave transitioning into the deceleration
phase. Further we assume the expansion of the blast-wave to be nearly
adiabatic, motivated by the low magnetic field deduced from the observations.
This allows us to recover within an order of magnitude the flux density at the
$\nu F_{\nu}$ peak, which is remarkable considering the simplicity of the
analytic model. Across all wavelengths, synchrotron emission from a single
forward shock provides a sufficient solution for the observations. Under this
scenario we argue that the distinction between $\textit{prompt}$ and $\textit{
afterglow}$ emission is superfluous as both early and late time emission
emanate from the same source. While the external shock model is clearly not a
universal solution, this analysis opens the possibility that at least some
fraction of GRBs can be explained with an external shock origin of their prompt
phase.

confine the high energy fusion-born helium nuclei ($\alpha$-particles) to
maintain the energy equilibrium of the plasma. However, energetic ions can
excite various instabilities which can lead to their enhanced radial transport.
Consequently, these instabilities may degrade the heating efficiency and they
can also cause harmful power loads on the plasma-facing components of the
device. Therefore, the understanding of these modes is a key issue regarding
future burning plasma experiments.
  One of the main open questions concerning energetic particle (EP) driven
instabilities is the non-linear evolution of the mode structure. In this
thesis, I present my results on the investigation of $\beta$-induced Alfv\'{e}n
eigenmodes (BAEs) and EP-driven geodesic acoustic modes (EGAMs) observed in the
ramp-up phase of off-axis NBI heated plasmas in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak.
These modes were well visible on several line-of-sights (LOSs) of the soft
X-ray cameras which made it possible to analyse the time evolution of their
spatial structure.
  In order to investigate the radial structure, the mode amplitude has to be
determined on different LOSs. I developed an advanced amplitude reconstruction
method which can handle the rapidly changing mode frequency and the low
signal-to-noise ratio. This method is based on short time Fourier transform
which is widely applied in the thesis, because it is ideal to investigate the
time evolution of transient wave-like phenomena.
  The radial structure analysis showed that in case of the observed downward
chirping BAEs the changes in the radial eigenfunction were smaller than the
uncertainty of the measurement, while in case of rapidly upward chirping EGAMs
the analysis shows shrinkage of the mode structure. These experimental results
are shown to be consistent with the corresponding theory.

shows signs of subsiding accretion after one second. By contrast, the growth of
the explosion energy in 2D is unsteady, and accretion lasts for several seconds
as confirmed by additional long-time simulations of stars of similar masses.
Appreciable explosion energies can still be reached, albeit at the expense of
rather high neutron star masses. In 2D, the binding energy at the gain radius
is larger because the strong excitation of downward-propagating g-modes removes
energy from the freshly accreted material in the downflows. Consequently, the
mass outflow rate is considerably lower in 2D than in 3D. This is only
partially compensated by additional heating by outward-propagating acoustic
waves in 2D. Moreover, the mass outflow rate in 2D is reduced because much of
the neutrino energy deposition occurs in downflows or bubbles confined by
secondary shocks without driving outflows. Episodic constriction of outflows
and vertical mixing of colder shocked material and hot, neutrino-heated ejecta
due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability further hamper the growth of the explosion

(2014). From WISE and 2MASS data we identify 544 and 418 candidate YSOs in the
vicinity of Lambda and Sigma respectively. Based on our followup spectroscopy
for some candidates and the existing literature for others, we found that
$\sim$80% of the K14-selected candidates are probable or likely members of the
Orion star forming region. The yield from the photometric selection criteria
shows that WISE sources with $K_S -w3 > 1.5$ mag and $K_S $ between 10--12 mag
are most likely to show spectroscopic signs of youth, while WISE sources with
$K_S -w3 > 4$ mag and $K_S > 12$ were often AGNs when followed up
spectroscopically. The population of candidate YSOs traces known areas of
active star formation, with a few new `hot spots' of activity near Lynds 1588
and 1589 and a more dispersed population of YSOs in the northern half of the
HII region bubble around $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ Ori. A minimal spanning tree
analysis of the two regions to identify stellar groupings finds that roughly
two-thirds of the YSO candidates in each region belong to groups of 5 or more
members. The population of stars selected by WISE outside the MST groupings
also contains spectroscopically verified YSOs, with a local stellar density as
low as 0.5 stars per square degree.

generation wireless systems. However, there are many open problems for the
implementation of those technologies. In particular, beamforming is necessary
in mm-wave systems in order to counter high propagation losses. However,
conventional beamsteering is not always appropriate in rich scattering
multipath channels with frequency selective fading, such as those found in
indoor environments. In this context, time-reversal (TR) is considered a
promising beamforming technique for such mm-wave massive MIMO systems. In this
paper, we analyze a baseband TR beamforming system for mm-wave multi-user
massive MIMO. We verify that, as the number of antennas increases, TR yields
good equalization and interference mitigation properties, but inter-user
interference (IUI) remains a main impairment. Thus, we propose a novel
technique called interference-nulling TR (INTR) to minimize IUI. We evaluate
numerically the performance of INTR and compare it with conventional TR and
equalized TR beamforming. We use a 60 GHz MIMO channel model with spatial
correlation based on the IEEE 802.11ad SISO NLoS model. We demonstrate that
INTR outperforms conventional TR with respect to average BER per user and
achievable sum rate under diverse conditions, providing both diversity and
multiplexing gains simultaneously.

ensembles, voting power and collective efficiency are described in brief.
Analytical (matrix) and extended (tree-graph) forms of game representation is

""rational irrationality"". Finally, a brief reference is presented for several
other more advanced concepts of gaming, including emergence of cooperation,
evolutionary stable strategies, two-level games, metagames, hypergames and the

block diagonal matrices is established. The group ring $RG$ of a finite group
$G$ is isomorphic to the set of {\em group ring matrices} over $R$. It is shown
that for any group ring matrix $A$ of $\mathbb{C} G$ there exists a matrix $P$
(independent of the entries of $A$) such that $P^{-1}AP=
\text{diag}(T_1,T_2,\ldots, T_r)$ for block matrices $T_i$ of fixed size
$s_i\times s_i$ where $r$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $G$ and $s_i$
are the ranks of the group ring matrices of the primitive idempotents. Using
the isomorphism of the group ring to the ring of group ring matrices followed
by the mapping $A\mapsto P^{-1}AP$ (where $P$ is of course fixed) gives an
isomorphism from the group ring to the ring of such block matrices.
Specialising to the group elements gives a faithful representation of the
group. Other representations of $G$ may be derived using the blocks in the
images of the group elements.
  Examples are given demonstrating how interesting and useful representations
of groups can be derived using the method.
  For a finite abelian group $Q$ an explicit matrix $P$ is given which
diagonalises any group ring matrix of $\mathbb{C} Q$. The matrix $P$ is defined
directly in terms of roots of unity depending only on an expression for $Q$ as
a product of cyclic groups. The characters and character table of $Q$ may be
read off directly from the rows of the diagonalising matrix $P$. This has
applications to signal processing and generalises the cyclic case.

treatment plans from flattened and flattening-filter-free (FFF) beam for three
anatomic cancer sites. Methods and Materials: Treatment plans with static
intensity-modulated radiotherapy beams and volumetric modulated arc therapy
beams were generated for 13 patients for both the flattened beam and the FFF
beam of the TrueBeam system. Beam energies of 6 MV and 10 MV were chosen for
planning. A total of 104 treatment plans were generated in 13 patients. In
order to analyze the biological effectiveness of treatment plans, dose volume
histograms (DVH) were utilized. Flattened and FFF beam plans are quantitatively
compared. Results: In head and neck cases, for VMAT plans, dose reduction in
the FFF beam plans compared to the flattened beam in left cochlea, right
submandibular gland and right parotid gland reached up to 2.36 Gy, 1.21 Gy and
1.45 Gy, respectively. Similarly, for static IMRT plans, the dose reduction of
the FFF beam plans compared to the flattened beam plans for the same organs
reached up to 0.34 Gy, 1.36 Gy and 1.46 Gy, respectively. Overall, for head and
neck, the FFF beam plans achieved mean dose reduction of up to 5%, 7% and 9%,
respectively for above organs at risk. For lung and prostate cases, the FFF
beams provided lower or comparable NTCP values to organ-at-risk (OAR) compared
to the flattened beam for all plans. Conclusions: In general, we observed
treatment plans utilizing FFF beams can improve dose sparing to OARs without
compromising the target coverage. Significant dose sparing effect is obtained
for head and neck cancer cases, especially for the cases with relatively large
field sizes (about 16x20 cm^2). For lung and prostate cases, compared to the
flattened beam, the FFF beam based treatment plans provide lower or comparable
dose to most OARs.

between the center of the stellar bar and photometric center of the stellar
disk; the bar center coincides with the kinematic center of the disk determined
from previous HI observations. Although the undisturbed shape of the disk
suggests that NGC 3906 has not undergone a significant merger event in its

interaction. Given the relatively isolated nature of NGC 3906 this interaction
could be with dark matter sub structure in the galaxy's halo or from a recent

have studied earlier a multi-scale percolation, employing any kxk basic cluster
for non-interacting particles. Here, with interactions included, we examine in
what way they alter the percolation threshold for any cluster case. We found
that at a fixed length scale k the interaction reduces the range of shifts of
the percolation threshold. To determine the critical concentrations, the
simplified model is used. It diminishes the number of local conductivities into
two main ones. In the presence of a dominance of the repulsive interaction over
the thermal energy, the exact percolation thresholds at scales k=2 and 3 can be
obtained from analytical formulas. Furthermore, by a simple reasoning, we
obtain the limiting threshold formula for odd k. When k>>1, the odd-even

(ABC-) stacked trilayer offer the unique possibility to open an electric field
tunable energy gap. To date, this energy gap has been experimentally confirmed
in optical spectroscopy. Here we report the first direct observation of the
electric field tunable energy gap in electronic transport experiments on doubly
gated suspended ABC-trilayer graphene. From a systematic study of the
non-linearities in current \textit{versus} voltage characteristics and the
temperature dependence of the conductivity we demonstrate that thermally
activated transport over the energy-gap dominates the electrical response of
these transistors. The estimated values for energy gap from the temperature
dependence and from the current voltage characteristics follow the
theoretically expected electric field dependence with critical exponent $3/2$.
These experiments indicate that high quality few-layer graphene are suitable
candidates for exploring novel tunable THz light sources and detectors.

phenotypic differences between species, populations and individuals.
Sequence-specific binding of transcription factors to the regulatory regions on
the DNA is a key regulatory mechanism that determines gene expression and hence
heritable phenotypic variation. We use a biophysical model for directional
selection on gene expression to estimate the rates of gain and loss of
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in finite populations under both
point and insertion/deletion mutations. Our results show that these rates are
typically slow for a single TFBS in an isolated DNA region, unless the
selection is extremely strong. These rates decrease drastically with increasing
TFBS length or increasingly specific protein-DNA interactions, making the
evolution of sites longer than ~10 bp unlikely on typical eukaryotic speciation
timescales. Similarly, evolution converges to the stationary distribution of
binding sequences very slowly, making the equilibrium assumption questionable.
The availability of longer regulatory sequences in which multiple binding sites
can evolve simultaneously, the presence of ""pre-sites"" or partially decayed old
sites in the initial sequence, and biophysical cooperativity between
transcription factors, can all facilitate gain of TFBS and reconcile
theoretical calculations with timescales inferred from comparative genetics.

paper, we want to predict anchor links between partially aligned social
networks, which is formally defined as the partial network alignment problem.
The partial network alignment problem is very difficult to solve because of the
following two challenges: (1) the lack of general features for anchor links,
and (2) the ""one-to-one$_\le$"" (one to at most one) constraint on anchor links.
To address these two challenges, a new method PNA (Partial Network Aligner) is
proposed in this paper. PNA (1) extracts a set of explicit anchor adjacency
features and latent topological features for anchor links based on the anchor
meta path concept and tensor decomposition techniques, and (2) utilizes the
generic stable matching to identify the non-anchor users to prune the redundant
anchor links attached to them. Extensive experiments conducted on two
real-world partially aligned social networks demonstrate that PNA can solve the
partial network alignment problem very well and outperform all the other
comparison methods with significant advantages.

We propose Ubora, an approach to measure the effect of slow running components

them twice. The first execution elides data from slow components and provides
fast online answers; the second execution waits for all components to complete.
Ubora uses memoization to speed up mature executions by replaying network

for a wide range of platforms, including Hadoop/Yarn, Apache Lucene, the
EasyRec Recommendation Engine, and the OpenEphyra question answering system.
Ubora computes answer quality much faster than competing approaches that do not
use memoization. With Ubora, we show that answer quality can and should be used

transverse momentum power spectrum contains the four-point function of density
and velocity fields, $\langle\delta\delta v v\rangle$. In the post-reionization
epoch, nonlinear effects dominate in the power spectrum. We use perturbation
theory and cosmological $N$-body simulations to calculate this nonlinearity. We
derive the next-to-leading order expression for the power spectrum with a
particular emphasis on the connected term that has been ignored in the
literature. While the contribution from the connected term on small scales
($k>0.1\,h\,\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$) is subdominant relative to the unconnected term, we
find that its contribution to the kSZ power spectrum at $\ell = 3000$ at $z<6$
can be as large as ten percent of the unconnected term, which would reduce the
allowed contribution from the reionization epoch ($z>6$) by twenty percent. The
power spectrum of transverse momentum on large scales is expected to scale as
$k^2$ as a consequence of momentum conservation. We show that both the leading

the Jacobian of $C$, provided that $C$ is smooth. We extend this result to the

case the set of matrix polynomials with spectral curve $C$ turns out to be
naturally stratified into smooth pieces, each one being an open subset in a
certain generalized Jacobian. We give a description of this stratification in

also make a conjecture on the relation between completely reducible matrix

toward a statistically significant sample of high-mass star forming cores. The
sources belong to the three main evolutionary categories of the high-mass star
formation process: high-mass starless cores, high-mass protostellar objects,
and ultracompact HII regions. Simultaneous measurements of 14N/15N in CN have
been made. The 14N/15N ratios derived from N2H+ show a large spread (from ~180
up to ~1300), while those derived from CN are in between the value measured in
the terrestrial atmosphere (~270) and that of the proto-Solar nebula (~440) for
the large majority of the sources within the errors. However, this different
spread might be due to the fact that the sources detected in the N2H+
isotopologues are more than those detected in the CN ones. The 14N/15N ratio
does not change significantly with the source evolutionary stage, which
indicates that time seems to be irrelevant for the fractionation of nitrogen.
We also find a possible anticorrelation between the 14N/15N (as derived from
N2H+) and the H/D isotopic ratios. This suggests that 15N enrichment could not
be linked to the parameters that cause D enrichment, in agreement with the
prediction by recent chemical models. These models, however, are not able to
reproduce the observed large spread in 14N/15N, pointing out that some
important routes of nitrogen fractionation could be still missing in the
models.

short orbital periods moving around the center of the Milky Way and the
corresponding hypothesis about the existence of a supermassive black hole
hosted at its center. In this paper we show how the mass and rotation
parameters of a Kerr black hole (assuming that the putative supermassive black
hole is of this type), as well as the distance that separates the black hole
from the Earth, can be estimated in a relativistic way in terms of i) the red
and blue shifts of photons that are emitted by geodesic massive particles
(stars and galactic gas) and travel along null geodesics towards a distant
observer, and ii) the radius of these star/gas orbits.
  As a concrete example and as a first step towards a full relativistic
analysis of the above mentioned star orbits around the center of our galaxy, we
consider stable equatorial circular orbits of stars and express their
corresponding red/blue shifts in terms of the metric parameters (mass and
angular momentum per unit mass) and the orbital radii of both the emitter star
(and/or galactic gas) and the distant observer.
  In principle, these expressions allow one to statistically estimate the mass
and rotation parameters of the Kerr black hole, and the radius of our orbit,
through a Bayesian fitting, i.e., with the aid of observational data: the
red/blue shifts measured at certain points of stars' orbits and their radii,
with their respective errors, a task that we hope to perform in the near
future. We also point to several astrophysical phenomena, like accretion discs
of rotating black holes, binary systems and active galactic nuclei, among
others, to which this formalism can be applied.

challenging, as the wavefront of the scattered light is highly disordered.
Recently developed ultrasound-guided wavefront shaping methods are addressing
this challenge, albeit with relatively low modulation efficiency and resolution
limitations. In this paper, we present a new technique, time-reversed
ultrasound microbubble encoded (TRUME) optical focusing, which is able to focus
light with improved efficiency and sub-ultrasound wavelength resolution. This
method ultrasonically destructs microbubbles, and measures the wavefront change
to compute and render a suitable time-reversed wavefront solution for focusing.
We demonstrate that the TRUME technique can create an optical focus at the site
of bubble destruction with a size of ~2 microns. Due to the nonlinear
pressure-to-destruction response, the TRUME technique can break the addressable
focus resolution barrier imposed by the ultrasound focus. We experimentally
demonstrate a 2-fold addressable focus resolution improvement in a microbubble
aggregate target.

representation in the transformed space not only incorporates the
discriminative aspects of the target dataset, but it also encodes the features
in terms of the general object categories that are present in indoor scenes. To
this end, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of 1300 object categories

activating only one tier of BSs, while the maximum area spectral efficiency
(ASE) is achieved by activating all the BSs. This reveals a unique tradeoff
between the ASE and link reliability in multiuser MIMO HetNets. To achieve the

efficient automatic analysis of real-world feature models (FM) of systems
ranging from cars to operating systems. It is well-known that solver-based
analysis of real-world FMs scale very well even though SAT instances obtained
from such FMs are large, and the corresponding analysis problems are known to
be NP-complete. To better understand why SAT solvers are so effective, we
systematically studied many syntactic and semantic characteristics of a
representative set of large real-world FMs. We discovered that a key reason why
large real-world FMs are easy-to-analyze is that the vast majority of the
variables in these models are unrestricted, i.e., the models are satisfiable
for both true and false assignments to such variables under the current partial
assignment. Given this discovery and our understanding of CDCL SAT solvers, we
show that solvers can easily find satisfying assignments for such models
without too many backtracks relative to the model size, explaining why solvers
scale so well. Further analysis showed that the presence of unrestricted
variables in these real-world models can be attributed to their high-degree of
variability. Additionally, we experimented with a series of well-known
non-backtracking simplifications that are particularly effective in solving
FMs. The remaining variables/clauses after simplifications, called the core,
are so few that they are easily solved even with backtracking, further
strengthening our conclusions.

accessible combinations of the cation and the anion. On top of that, cations
can be functionalized using methods of organic chemistry. This paper reports
gas-phase thermodynamics (enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy) of the
halogenation reactions (fluorination, chlorination, bromination) involving
protonated pyrrolidine C4H10N+, protic N-ethylpyrrolidinium C4H9N(C2H5)+, and
aprotic N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium C4H8N(CH3)(C2H5)+ cations. Substitution
of all symmetrically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms was compared based of the
thermodynamic favorability. Fluorination of all sites is much more favorable
than chlorination, whereas chlorination is somewhat more favorable than
bromination. This is not trivial, since electronegative fluorine and chlorine
have to compete for the already insufficient number of electrons with other
atoms belonging to the pyrrolidinium-based cations. The difference between
different reaction sites within the cations is modest, although it often
exceeds kT at simulated temperatures. The correlation between thermodynamics
and electronic density distribution has been established, which allows new
simple prediction of the reaction pathways. The reported results inspire
further chemical modifications of the pyrrolidinium-based RTILs to achieve ever
finer tunability of physical chemical properties.

describe particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Among these the ""New
minimal supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory"" (NMSGUT) based on Higgs
system 10+120+210+126+$\overline{126}$ has been developing since 1982. It now
successfully fits the whole standard Model gauge coupling, symmetry breaking
and fermion mass-mixing data as well as the neutrino mass and mixing data in
terms of NMSGUT parameters and just 6 soft supersymmetry breaking parameters
defined at the GUT scale. In this thesis we study the phenomenology of NMSGUT,
its implications for inflationary and Cold Dark matter cosmology and develop
Renormalization group(RG) equations for the flow of NMSGUT couplings in the
extreme ultraviolet. In the first part we show that superheavy threshold
effects can drastically lower the SO(10) yukawa couplings required for
realistic unification and this cures the long standing problem of fast proton
decay in Susy GUT. Then we propose a novel Supersymmetric Seesaw
inflection(SSI) scenario based upon a SU(2)_L x U(1)_R x U(1)_{B-L} invariant
model, where the inflation mass is controlled by the large conjugate sneutrino
mass. We show that it is much less fine-tuned and more stable than Dirac
sneutrino based MSSM inflation. NMSGUT can embed SSI, and even provide a large
tensor scalar ratio, but obstacles in achieving enough inflation remain. The
NMSGUT Bino LSP is a good dark matter candidate when it can co-annihilate with
a nearly degenerate sfermion as in fits with a light smuon. We also calculate
two loop NMSGUT gauge-Yukawa Renormalization Group(RG) beta functions and show
that GUT scale negative Higgs mass squared parameters required by NMSGUT fits
can arise by RG flows from positive values at the Planck scale.

may consider gauging matter by strongly coupled gauge theories at criticality
rather than by weakly coupled (asymptotic free) gauge theories. It often
triggers relevant deformations and possibly leads to a non-trivial fixed point.
In many examples such as the IR limit of SQCDs (and their variants), the
relevant RG flow induced by this strong gauging makes the total central charge
$a$ increase rather than decrease compared with the sum of the original
decoupled CFTs. The dilaton effective field theory argument given by
Komargodski and Schwimmer does not apply because strong gauging is not a simple
deformation by operators in the original two decoupled CFTs and it may not be
UV complete. When the added matter is vector-like, one may emulate strong
gauging in a UV completed manner by decoupling of ghost matter. While the UV
completed description makes the dilaton effective field theory argument
possible, due to the non-unitarity, we cannot conclude the positivity of the
central charge difference in accordance with the observations in various

vacuum fluctuation of an arbitrary field is modified by static or slowly
varying boundary. However, its spin version is rarely addressed, mainly due to
the fact that a macroscopic boundary in quantum spin systems is hard to define.
In this article, we explore the spin Casimir effect induced by the zero-point
fluctuation of spin waves in a general non-collinear ordered quantum
antiferromagnet. This spin Casimir effect results in a spin torque between
local spins and further causes various singular and divergent results in the
framework of spin-wave theory, which invalidate the standard $1/S$ expansion
procedure. To avoid this dilemma, we develop a self-consistent spin-wave
expansion approach, which preserves the spin-wave expansion away from
singularities and divergence. A detailed spin-wave analysis of the
antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a spatially anisotropic
triangular lattice is undertaken within our approach. Our results indicate that
the spiral order is only stable in the region $0.5<\alpha<1.2$, where $\alpha$
is the ratio of the coupling constants. In addition, the instability in the
region $1.2<\alpha<2$ is owing to the spin Casimir effect instead of the
vanishing sublattice magnetization. And this extended spiral instable region
may host some quantum disordered phases besides the quantum order by disorder
induced Neel phase. Furthermore, our method provides an efficient and
convenient tool that can estimate the correct exchange parameters and outline
the quantum phase diagrams, which can be useful for experimental fitting
processes in frustrated quantum magnets.

Since binary synapses are considered, learning happens through formation and
elimination of connections between the inputs and the dendritic branches to

algorithm inspired by the 'Tempotron', i.e., a recently proposed temporal
learning algorithm-is presented in this work. Unlike 'Tempotron', the proposed
learning rule uses a technique to automatically adapt the NNLD threshold during
training. Experimental results indicate that our NNLD with 1-bit synapses can
obtain similar accuracy as a traditional Tempotron with 4-bit synapses in
classifying single spike random latency and pair-wise synchrony patterns.
Hence, the proposed method is better suited for robust hardware implementation
in the presence of statistical variations. We also present results of applying

In applications where the covariance matrix naturally possesses a certain

estimation procedure is beneficial to improve the estimation accuracy. We
propose incorporating the prior structure information into Tyler's M-estimator
and formulate the problem as minimizing the cost function of Tyler's estimator
under the prior structural constraint. First, the estimation under a general
convex structural constraint is introduced with an efficient algorithm for
finding the estimator derived based on the majorization minimization (MM)
algorithm framework. Then, the algorithm is tailored to several special
structures that enjoy a wide range of applications in signal processing related
fields, namely, sum of rank-one matrices, Toeplitz, and banded Toeplitz
structure. In addition, two types of non-convex structures, i.e., the Kronecker
structure and the spiked covariance structure, are also discussed, where it is
shown that simple algorithms can be derived under the guidelines of MM.
Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves a smaller
estimation error than the benchmark estimators at a lower computational cost.

twentieth century with the discovery of the recession of galaxies by Hubble and
with the Lemaitre and Friedmann's interpretation in the 1920s.
  However, the concept of an evolving universe is intrinsically tied to the law
of universal gravitation, and it is surprising that it remained unrecognized
for more than two centuries. A remarkable exception to this lack of awareness
is represented by Poe. In Eureka (1848), the writer developed a conception of
an evolving universe following the reasoning that a physical universe cannot be
static and nothing can stop stars or galaxies from collapsing on each other.
Unfortunately this literary work was, and still is, very little understood both
by the literary critics and scientists of the time. We will discuss Poe's
cosmological views in their historical scientific context, highlighting the
remarkable insights of the writer, such as those dealing with the Olbers
paradox, the existence of other galaxies and of a multi-universe.

Many of these methods provide unprecedented temporal granularity by estimating
a functional connectivity network at each point in time; resulting in
high-dimensional output which can be studied in a variety of ways. One possible
method is to employ graph embedding algorithms. Such algorithms effectively map
estimated networks from high-dimensional spaces down to a low dimensional
vector space; thus facilitating visualization, interpretation and
classification. In this work, the dynamic properties of functional connectivity
are studied using working memory task data from the Human Connectome Project. A
recently proposed method is employed to estimate dynamic functional

embedding methods based on linear projections. These methods are shown to
provide informative embeddings that can be directly interpreted as functional

a convenient procedure of the elimination of the spurious inter-layer

the interpretation of the so-called $\pi$ and $\pi+\sigma$ excitations in

realistic path-loss and blockage models, which are derived from experimental

different distributions for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation
conditions and the blockage model includes an outage state that provides a
better representation of the outage possibilities of millimeter wave

Poisson point process and by relying upon a noise-limited approximation for
typical millimeter wave network deployments, exact integral expressions for
computing the coverage probability and the average rate are obtained. With the
aid of Monte Carlo simulations, the noise-limited approximation is shown to be
sufficiently accurate for typical network densities. Furthermore, it is shown
that sufficiently dense millimeter wave cellular networks are capable of
outperforming micro wave cellular networks, both in terms of coverage

vortices initially arranged on the vertices of a regular polygon. At low to
moderate Reynolds numbers, we find an additional stage in the merger process,
absent in the merger of two vortices, where an annular vortical structure is
formed and is long-lived. Vortex merger is slowed down significantly due to
this. Such annular vortices are known at far higher Reynolds numbers in studies
of tropical cyclones, which have been noticed to a break down into individual
vortices. In the pre-annular stage, vortical structures in a viscous flow are
found here to tilt and realign in a manner similar to the inviscid case, but
the pronounced filaments visible in the latter are practically absent in the
former. Interestingly at higher Reynolds numbers, the merger of an odd number
of vortices is found to proceed very differently from that of an even number.
The former process is rapid and chaotic whereas the latter proceeds more slowly
via pairing events. The annular vortex takes the form of a generalised
Lamb-Oseen vortex (GLO), and diffuses inwards until it forms a standard
Lamb-Oseen vortex. For lower Reynolds number, the numerical (fully nonlinear)
evolution of the GLO vortex follows exactly the analytical evolution until
merger. At higher Reynolds numbers, the annulus goes through instabilities
whose nonlinear stages show a pronounced difference between even and odd mode
disturbances. It is hoped that the present findings, that multiple vortex
merger is qualitatively different from the merger of two vortices, will
motivate studies on how multiple vortex interactions affect the inverse cascade

In margin bound, expected error is upper bounded by empirical margin error plus
Rademacher Average (RA) based capacity term. First, we derive an upper bound
for RA of DNN, and show that it increases with increasing depth. This indicates
negative impact of depth on test performance. Second, we show that deeper
networks tend to have larger representation power (measured by Betti numbers
based complexity) than shallower networks in multi-class setting, and thus can
lead to smaller empirical margin error. This implies positive impact of depth.
The combination of these two results shows that for DNN with restricted number
of hidden units, increasing depth is not always good since there is a tradeoff
between positive and negative impacts. These results inspire us to seek
alternative ways to achieve positive impact of depth, e.g., imposing
margin-based penalty terms to cross entropy loss so as to reduce empirical
margin error without increasing depth. Our experiments show that in this way,
we achieve significantly better test performance.

global globular cluster properties. We discuss two scenarios for intermediate
mass black hole formation. The SLOW and FAST scenarios. They occur later or
earlier in the cluster evolution and require smaller or extremely large central

black holes is highly stochastic. In general, higher formation probabilities
follow from larger cluster concentrations (i.e. central densities). We further
discuss possible observational signatures of the presence of intermediate mass

radio, X-ray and gravitational wave emissions due to dynamical collisions or

strong dynamical interactions between binaries and an intermediate mass black
hole. All simulations discussed in this paper were performed with the MOCCA

development case study on building a multi-layered agent-based ICN in which
agents cooperate to provide an effective supervision and control of a set of
control processes, basically controlled by a set of legacy control systems with
limited computing capabilities. The proposed ICN is designed to add an
intelligent layer on top of legacy control systems to compensate their limited
capabilities using a cost-effective agent-based approach, and also to provide
global synchronization and safety plans. It is tested and evaluated within a
simulation environment. The main conclusion of this research is that agents and
MAS can provide an effective, flexible, and cost-effective solution to handle
the emerged limitations of legacy control systems if they are properly
integrated with these systems.

around the common center of the system mass with perturbed mean motion. The
existence and stability of triangular equilibrium points have been explored. It
has been shown that triangular equilibrium points are stable for $0<\mu<\mu_c$

parameter. We find that, the oblateness up to $J_2$ of the primaries and the
radiation reduces the stability range while the oblateness up to $J_4$ of the
primaries increases the size of stability both in the context where PDP is
considered and ignored. The PDP has an effect of about $\approx0.01$ reduction
on the application of $\mu_c$ to Earth-Moon and Jupiter-Moons systems. We find
that the comprehensive effects of the perturbations have a stabilizing
proclivity. However, the oblateness up to $J_2$ of the primaries and the
radiation of the primaries have tendency for instability, while coefficients up
to $J_4$ of the primaries have stability predisposition. In the limiting case
$c=0$, and also by setting appropriate parameter(s) to zero, our results are in
excellent agreement with the ones obtained previously. Libration points play
very important role in space mission and as a consequence, our results have a

field for the whole day at the equator was not just weakened but actually was
flipped for several hours by the influence of tides related to the spectacular
Sun-Moon-Earth alignment near the middle of the day. The effect of flipping the
electric field was clearly seen in the equatorial ionosonde data and through
the large array of GPS receivers that accomplished the TEC data. The main
impact of the change in the electric field was the reduced EIA at all

equatorial F-region density profile was also showing an enhanced F region peak
in spite of a reduced VTEC. By comparison to the plasma density depletion
associated with the temporary lack of photo-ionization during the episode of
eclipse, the electrodynamical consequences of the eclipse were far more
important and influenced the plasma density over a wide range of latitudes.

challenges in collaborative filtering recommender systems (CFRSs). Many efforts
have been devoted to improve collaborative filtering techniques which can
eliminate the ""shilling"" attacks. However, most of them focused on detecting
push attack or nuke attack which is rated with the highest score or lowest
score on the target items. Few pay attention to grey attack when a target item
is rated with a lower or higher score than the average score, which shows a
more hidden rating behavior than push or nuke attack. In this paper, we present
a novel detection method to make recommender systems resistant to such attacks.
To characterize grey ratings, we exploit rating deviation of item to
discriminate between grey attack profiles and genuine profiles. In addition, we
also employ novelty and popularity of item to construct rating series. Since it
is difficult to discriminate between the rating series of attacker and genuine
users, we incorporate into discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to amplify these
differences based on the rating series of rating deviation, novelty and
popularity, respectively. Finally, we respectively extract features from rating
series of rating deviation-based, novelty-based and popularity-based by using
amplitude domain analysis method and combine all clustered results as our
detection results. We conduct a list of experiments on both the Book-Crossing

included to validate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the
benchmarked methods.

manner, the constraints from future large scale structure surveys on the local
non-gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ when the standard power law assumption
for the primordial power spectrum is relaxed. If the analyses are restricted to
the large scale-dependent bias induced in the linear matter power spectrum by
non-gaussianites, the errors on the $f_{\rm NL}$ parameter could be increased
by $60\%$ when exploiting data from the future DESI survey, if dealing with
only one possible dark matter tracer. In the same context, a nontrivial bias
$|\delta f_{\rm NL}| \sim 2.5$ could be induced if future data are fitted to

  Networks",,,,"TKN-15-002","cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neighbor discovery is a fundamental task for wireless networks deployment. It
is essential for setup and maintenance of networks and is typically a
precondition for further communication. In this work we focus on passive
discovery of networks operating in multi-channel environments, performed by
listening for periodically transmitted beaconing messages. It is well-known
that performance of such discovery approaches strongly depends on the structure
of the adopted Beacon Interval (BI) set, that is, set of intervals between
individual beaconing messages. However, although imposing constraints on this
set has the potential to make the discovery process more efficient, there is
demand for high-performance discovery strategies for BI sets that are as
general as possible. They would allow to cover a broad range of wireless
technologies and deployment scenarios, and enable network operators to select
BI's that are best suited for the targeted application and/or device
characteristics. In the present work, we introduce a family of novel
low-complexity discovery algorithms that minimize both the Expected Mean
Discovery Time (EMDT) and the makespan, for a quite general family of BI sets.
Notably, this family of BI sets completely includes BI's supported by IEEE
802.15.4 and a large part of BI's supported by IEEE 802.11. Furthermore, we
present another novel discovery algorithm, based on an Integer Linear Program
(ILP), that minimizes EMDT for arbitrary BI sets. In addition to analytically
proving optimality, we numerically evaluate the proposed algorithms using
different families of BI sets and compare their performance with the passive
scan of IEEE 802.15.4 w.r.t. various performance metrics, such as makespan,
EMDT, energy usage, etc.

which reduces network overhead and latency but requires service migrations as
users move to new locations. It is challenging to make migration decisions
optimally because of the uncertainty in such a dynamic cloud environment. In
this paper, we formulate the service migration problem as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP). Our formulation captures general cost models and provides a
mathematical framework to design optimal service migration policies. In order
to overcome the complexity associated with computing the optimal policy, we
approximate the underlying state space by the distance between the user and
service locations. We show that the resulting MDP is exact for uniform
one-dimensional user mobility while it provides a close approximation for
uniform two-dimensional mobility with a constant additive error. We also
propose a new algorithm and a numerical technique for computing the optimal
solution which is significantly faster than traditional methods based on
standard value or policy iteration. We illustrate the application of our
solution in practical scenarios where many theoretical assumptions are relaxed.
Our evaluations based on real-world mobility traces of San Francisco taxis show
superior performance of the proposed solution compared to baseline solutions.

Standard Model can couple to an arbitrary stringy gravitational background in
an $\mathbf{O}(4,4)$ T-duality covariant manner and manifest two independent
local Lorentz symmetries, $\mathbf{Spin}(1,3)\times\mathbf{Spin}(3,1)$. While
the diagonal gauge fixing of the twofold spin groups leads to the conventional
formulation on the flat Minkowskian background, the enhanced symmetry makes the
Standard Model more rigid, and also stringy, than it appeared. The CP violating
$\theta$-term may no longer be allowed by the symmetry, and hence the strong CP
problem is solved. There are now stronger constraints imposed on the possible
higher order corrections. We speculate that the quarks and the leptons may
possibly belong to the two different spin classes.

formal methods' focus on models rather than implementations. In this paper we
present formal methods and tools for designing protected code and proving its

between the model and the implementation by working on the latter rather than
on a high-level model. Indeed, our methods allow us (a) to automatically insert
a power balancing countermeasure directly at the assembly level, and to prove
the correctness of the induced code transformation; and (b) to prove that the
obtained code is balanced with regard to a reasonable leakage model. We also
show how to characterize the hardware to use the resources which maximize the
relevancy of the model. The tools implementing our methods are then
demonstrated in a case study on an 8-bit AVR smartcard for which we generate a
provably protected present implementation that reveals to be at least 250 times

aggregates of initially uniform porosity, melt segregates into high-porosity
sheets (bands in cross-section). The bands emerge at 15-20 degrees to the shear
plane. A model of viscous anisotropy can explain these low angles whereas
previous, simpler models have failed to do so. The anisotropic model is
complex, however, and the reason that it produces low-angle bands has not been
understood. Here we show that there are two mechanisms: (i) suppression of the
well-known tensile instability, and (ii) creation of a new, shear-driven
instability. We elucidate these mechanisms using linearised stability analysis
in a coordinate system that is aligned with the perturbations. We consider the
general case of anisotropy that varies dynamically with deviatoric stress, but
approach it by first considering uniform anisotropy that is imposed a priori
and showing the difference between static and dynamic cases. We extend the
model of viscous anisotropy to include a strengthening in the direction of
maximum compressive stress. Our results support the hypothesis that viscous
anisotropy is the cause of low band-angles in experiments.

explored by the new dwarf galaxy observation. Considering the case the WIMP
pair mass below top quark mass, a pseudoscalar $\phi$ is studied in this

shell-like structures, in which galaxy clusters have maxima in the distance
distribution to other galaxy groups and clusters at the distance of about 120
Mpc/h. The rich galaxy cluster A1795, the central cluster of the Bootes
supercluster, has the highest maximum in the distance distribution of other
groups and clusters around them at the distance of about 120 Mpc/h among our
rich cluster sample, and another maximum at the distance of about 240 Mpc/h.
The structures of galaxy systems causing the maxima at 120 Mpc/h form an almost
complete shell of galaxy groups, clusters and superclusters. The richest
systems in the nearby universe, the Sloan Great Wall, the Corona Borealis
supercluster and the Ursa Major supercluster are among them. The probability
that we obtain maxima like this from random distributions is lower than 0.001.
Our results confirm that shell-like structures can be found in the distribution
of nearby galaxies and their systems. The radii of the possible shells are
larger than expected for a BAO shell (approximately 109 Mpc/h versus
approximately 120 Mpc/h), and they are determined by very rich galaxy clusters
and superclusters with high density contrast while BAO shells are barely seen

beta decay. We show that a sizable contribution to the effective Majorana
neutrino mass from the exchange of heavy Majorana neutrinos is always possible,
provided one requires a fine-tuned cancellation between the tree-level and
one-loop contribution to the light neutrino masses. We quantify the level of
fine-tuning as a function of the seesaw parameters and introduce a

progressive development of a slow-rotators sequence. The observed clustering on
this sequence suggests that it corresponds to some equilibrium or asymptotic
condition that still lacks a complete theoretical interpretation, crucial to
our understanding of the stellar angular momentum evolution. We couple a
rotational evolution model, which takes into account internal differential
rotation, with classical and new proposals for the wind braking law, and fit
models to the data using a MCMC method. The description of the evolution of the
slow-rotators sequence requires taking into account the transfer of angular
momentum from the radiative core to the convective envelope; we find that, in
the mass range 0.85-1.10 $M_{\odot}$, the core-envelope coupling time-scale for
stars in the slow-rotators sequence scales as $M^{-7.28}$. Quasi-solid body
rotation is achieved only after 1-2 Gyr, depending on stellar mass, which
implies that observing small deviations from the Skumanich law ($P \propto
\sqrt{t}$) would require period data of older open clusters than available to
date. The observed evolution in the 0.1-2.5 Gyr age range and in the 0.85-1.10
$M_{\odot}$ mass range is best reproduced by assuming an empirical mass
dependence of the wind angular momentum loss proportional to the convective
turnover time-scale and to the stellar moment of inertia. Period isochrones
based on our MCMC fit provide a tool for inferring stellar ages of solar-like
main-sequence stars from their mass and rotation period largely independent
from the wind braking model adopted. These effectively represent
gyro-chronology relationships that take into account the physics of the
two-zone model for the stellar angular momentum evolution.

sample of ten spiral galaxies. Our analysis focused on the galaxy region where
the disc contributes more than 95 per cent of total surface brightness in order
to minimise the contamination of the bulge and bar. The luminosity-weighted age
and metallicity were obtained by fitting the galaxy spectra with a linear
combination of stellar population synthesis models, while the total
overabundance of {\alpha}-elements over iron was derived by measuring the
line-strength indices. Most of the sample discs display a bimodal age
distribution and they are characterised by a total [{\alpha}/Fe] enhancement
ranging from solar and supersolar. We interpreted the age bimodality as due to
the simultaneous presence of both a young (Age$\,\leq\,4$ Gyr) and an old
(Age$\,>\,$4 Gyr) stellar population. The old stellar component usually
dominates the disc surface brightness and its light contribution is almost
constant within the observed radial range. For this reason, no age gradient is
observed in half of the sample galaxies. The old component is slightly more
metal poor than the young one. The metallicity gradient is negative and
slightly positive in the old and young components, respectively. These results
are in agreement with an inside-out scenario of disc formation and suggest a
reduced impact of the radial migration on the stellar populations of the disc.
The young component could be the result of a second burst of star formation in
gas captured from the environment.

particle-in-cell ions to study the temporal evolution of ion temperatures,
temperature anisotropies and velocity distribution functions in relation to the
dissipation and turbulent evolution of a broad-band spectrum of parallel and
obliquely propagating Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves. The purpose of this paper is to
study the relative role of parallel versus oblique Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves in
the observed heating and acceleration of minor ions in the fast solar wind. We
consider collisionless homogeneous multi-species plasma, consisting of
isothermal electrons, isotropic protons and a minor component of drifting
$\alpha$ particles in a finite-$\beta$ fast stream near the Earth. The kinetic
ions are modeled by initially isotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution
functions, which develop non-thermal features and temperature anisotropies when
a broad-band spectrum of low-frequency non-resonant, $\omega \leq 0.34
\Omega_p$, Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves is imposed at the beginning of the
simulations. The initial plasma parameter values, such as ion density,
temperatures and relative drift speeds, are supplied by fast solar wind
observations made by the \textit{Wind} spacecraft at 1AU. The imposed
broad-band wave spectra is left-hand polarized and resembles \textit{Wind}
measurements of Alfv\'enic turbulence in the solar wind. The imposed magnetic
field fluctuations for all cases are within the inertial range of the solar
wind turbulence and have a Kraichnan-type spectral slope $\alpha=-3/2$. We vary
the propagation angle from $\theta= 0^\circ$ to $\theta=30^\circ$ and
$\theta=60^\circ$, and find that the minor ion heating is most efficient for
the highly-oblique waves propagating at $60^\circ$, whereas the protons exhibit
perpendicular cooling at all propagation angles.

coordinated parallel clients, has been the primary driver of Lustre development
over the last decade. With the advent of extreme scale computing and Big Data

diverse workloads that place new demands on Lustre. In March 2015, the
International Workshop on the Lustre Ecosystem: Challenges and Opportunities
was held in Annapolis, Maryland at the Historic Inns of Annapolis Governor
Calvert House. This workshop series is intended to help explore improvements in
the performance and flexibility of Lustre for supporting diverse application
workloads. The 2015 workshop was the inaugural edition, and the goal was to
initiate a discussion on the open challenges associated with enhancing Lustre

simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) algorithm is generalized to

SOMP-NS where NS stands for noise stabilization. To begin with, a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm is developed.
This framework is then used to build conservative lower bounds on the
probability of partial or full joint support recovery. Numerical simulations
show that the proposed algorithm outperforms SOMP and that the theoretical

\ion{Si}{4}~$1394/1403$ \AA\ become highly broadened both in red as well as
blue wings. Several absorption lines on top of the broadened profiles were
identified. In addition, emission lines corresponding to neutral lines such as
\ion{Cl}{1}~1351.66~{\AA}, \ion{C}{1}~1354.29~{\AA}, and
\ion{C}{1}~1355.84~{\AA} were identified. The \ion{C}{1}~1354.29~{\AA}, and

\ion{O}{4} is about $10^{13.5}$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the observed events
are most likely occurring at heights corresponding to lower chromosphere. To
the best of our knowledge, for the first time we have detected short-period
variability (30 s and 60--90 s) within the EE bursts. Observations of
photospheric magnetic field underneath EEs indicate that negative polarity
field emerges in the neighbourhood of oppositely directed positive fields which
undergo repetitive reconnection (magnetic flux cancellation) events. The
dynamic changes observed in AIA 1700 \AA, 1600 \AA, \ion{C}{2} 1330 \AA\ and
\ion{Si}{4} 1400 \AA\ intensity images corresponded very well with the
emergence and cancellation of photospheric magnetic field (negative polarity)
on the time scale of 3--5 min. The observations reported here suggests that
these EEs are formed due to magnetic reconnection and are occurring in the
lower chromosphere.

cosmic ALP background (CAB) analogous to the CMB, whose existence is suggested
by string models of inflation. ALP-photon conversion of a CAB in the magnetic
fields of galaxy clusters has been proposed as an explanation of the cluster

parameters required to explain the cluster soft X-ray excess, the photon flux
from ALP-photon conversion in the Milky Way would be unobservably small. The
ALP-photon conversion probability in galaxy clusters is 3 orders of magnitude
higher than that in the Milky Way. Furthermore, the morphology of the
unresolved cosmic X-ray background is incompatible with a significant component

second for the Euler class of an oriented orbibundle. In this approach, instead
of appearing as the zero set of a multivalued section, the Euler class is the
zero set of a single-valued section of the pullback bundle over the resolution,
and hence has the structure of a weighted branched manifold in which the
weights and branching are canonically defined by the atlas.

transition lines is investigated. These models belong to the class of the
spherical mean-field approximation of a spin-$1$ model with $p$-body quenched
disordered interaction, with $p>2$, termed spherical Blume-Emery-Griffiths
models. Depending on temperature and chemical potential the system is found in
a paramagnetic or in a glassy phase and the transition between these phases can
be of a different nature. In specific regions of the phase diagram coexistence
of low density and high density paramagnets can occur, as well as the
coexistence of spin-glass and paramagnetic phases. The exact static solution
for the glassy phase is known to be obtained by the one-step replica symmetry
breaking ansatz. Different scenarios arise for both the dynamic and the
thermodynamic transitions. These include: (i) the usual random first- order
transition (Kauzmann-like) for mean-field glasses preceded by a dynamic
transition, (ii) a thermodynamic first-order transition with phase coexistence
and latent heat and (iii) a regime of apparent inversion of static transition
line and dynamic transition lines, the latter defined as a non-zero complexity
line. The latter inversion, though, turns out to be preceded by a novel
dynamical arrest line at higher temperature. Crossover between different
regimes is analyzed by solving mode coupling theory equations throughout the
space of external thermodynamic parameters and the relationship with the
underlying statics is discussed.

have many more genotypes than phenotypes. But can the way that genotypes are
distributed over phenotypes determine evolutionary outcomes? Answering such
questions is difficult because the number of genotypes can be
hyper-astronomically large. By solving the genotype-phenotype (GP) map for RNA
secondary structure for systems up to length $L=126$ nucleotides (where the set
of all possible RNA strands would weigh more than the mass of the visible
universe) we show that the GP map strongly constrains the evolution of
non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Simple random sampling over genotypes predicts the
distribution of properties such as the mutational robustness or the number of
stems per secondary structure found in naturally occurring ncRNA with
surprising accuracy. Since we ignore natural selection, this strikingly close
correspondence with the mapping suggests that structures allowing for
functionality are easily discovered, despite the enormous size of the genetic
spaces. The mapping is extremely biased: the majority of genotypes map to an
exponentially small portion of the morphospace of all biophysically possible
structures. Such strong constraints provide a non-adaptive explanation for the
convergent evolution of structures such as the hammerhead ribozyme. These
results presents a particularly clear example of bias in the arrival of
variation strongly shaping evolutionary outcomes and may be relevant to Mayr's
distinction between proximate and ultimate causes in evolutionary biology.

dealing with its inherent parameter degeneracies. Including priors into a data
analysis can mask the information content of a given data set alone. However,
since the information content of a data set is usually estimated with the
Fisher matrix, priors are added in order to enforce an approximately Gaussian
likelihood. Here, we compare priorless forecasts to more conventional forecasts
that use priors. We find strongly non-Gaussian likelihoods for 2d-weak lensing
if no priors are used, which we approximate with the DALI-expansion. Without
priors, the Fisher matrix of the 2d-weak lensing likelihood includes unphysical
values of $\Omega_m$ and $h$, since it does not capture the shape of the
likelihood well. The Cramer-Rao inequality then does not need to apply. We find
that DALI and Monte Carlo Markov Chains predict the presence of a dark energy
with high significance, whereas a Fisher forecast of the same data set also
allows decelerated expansion. We also find that a 2d-weak lensing analysis
provides a sharp lower limit on the Hubble constant of $h > 0.4$, even if the
equation of state of dark energy is jointly constrained by the data. This is
not predicted by the Fisher matrix and usually masked in other works by a sharp
prior on $h$. Additionally, we find that DALI estimates Figures of Merit in the
presence of non-Gaussianities better than the Fisher matrix. We additionally
demonstrate how DALI allows switching to a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of
a highly curved likelihood with acceptance rates of $\approx 0.5$, an effective
covering of the parameter space, and numerically effectively costless leapfrog
steps. This shows how quick forecasts can be upgraded to accurate forecasts
whenever needed. Results were gained with the public code from

submillimeter (THz) burst occurred on 2003 November 2 was investigated in
detail for the first time. Observations show that the flux density of the THz
spectrum increased steeply with frequency above 200 GHz. Their average rising
rates reached a value of 235 sfu/GHz (corresponding spectral index $\alpha$ of
4.8) during the burst. The flux densities reached about 4,000 and 70,000 sfu at
212 and 405 GHz at maximum phase, respectively. The emissions at 405 GHz
maintained continuous high level that they exceed largely the peak values of
the microwave (MW) spectra during the main phase. Our studies suggest that only
energetic electrons with a low-energy cutoff of $\sim$1 MeV and number density
of $\sim$$10^{6}$--$10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$ can produce such strong and steeply
rising THz component via gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation based on numerical
simulations of burst spectra in the nonuniform magnetic field case. The
electron number density $N$, derived from our numerical fits to the THz
temporal evolution spectra, increased substantially from $8\times10^{6}$ to
$4\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$, i.e., $N$ value increased 50 times during the rise
phase. During the decay phase it decreased to $7\times10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$, i.e.,
decreased about five times from the maximum phase. The total electron number
decreased an order of magnitude from the maximum phase to the decay phase.
Nevertheless the variation amplitude of $N$ is only about one time in the MW
emission source during this burst, and the total electron number did not
decrease but increased by about 20$\%$ during the decay phase. Interestingly,
we find that the THz source radius decreased by about 24$\%$ while the MW
source one, on the contrary, increased by 28$\%$ during the decay phase.

We combined interior structures calculated using a Henyey-type evolution code
with optically thick wind solutions of hydrogen-rich envelopes, which give the
proper mass-loss rates, photospheric temperatures, and luminosities. The light
curve model is calculated for a 1.38 M_sun white dwarf (WD) with an accretion
rate of 1.6 \times 10^{-7} M_sun yr^{-1}. This model shows a very high
effective temperature (log T_ph (K) \geq 4.97) and a very small wind mass-loss
rate (\dot M_wind \leq 9.3 \times 10^{-6} M_sun yr^{-1}) even at the maximum
expansion of the photosphere. These properties are consistent with the faint
optical peak of M31N 2008-12a because the brightness of the free-free emission
is proportional to the square of the mass-loss rate. The model well reproduces
the short supersoft X-ray turn-on time of 6 days and turnoff time of 18 days
after the outburst. The ejecta mass of our model is calculated to be 6.3 \times
10^{-8} M_sun, corresponding to 37% of the accreted mass. The growth rate of
the WD is 0.63 times the mass accretion rate, making it a progenitor for a Type
Ia supernova. Our light curve model predicts a bright supersoft X-ray phase one
or two days before the optical peak. We encourage detection of this X-ray flash
in future outbursts.

tracking of sparse spatial channels in millimeter (mm) wave picocellular
networks. The base stations are equipped with antenna arrays with a large
number of elements (which can fit within compact form factors because of the
small carrier wavelength) and employ radio frequency (RF) beamforming, so that
standard least squares adaptation techniques (which require access to
individual antenna elements) are not applicable. We focus on the downlink, and
show that ""compressive beacons,"" transmitted using pseudorandom phase settings
at the base station array, and compressively processed using pseudorandom phase
settings at the mobile array, provide information sufficient for accurate
estimation of the two-dimensional (2D) spatial frequencies associated with the
directions of departure of the dominant rays from the base station, and the
associated complex gains. This compressive approach is compatible with coarse
phase-only control, and is based on a near-optimal sequential algorithm for
frequency estimation which can exploit the geometric continuity of the channel
across successive beaconing intervals to reduce the overhead to less than 1%
even for very large (32 x 32) arrays. Compressive beaconing is essentially
omnidirectional, and hence does not enjoy the SNR and spatial reuse benefits of
beamforming obtained during data transmission. We therefore discuss system
level design considerations for ensuring that the beacon SNR is sufficient for
accurate channel estimation, and that inter-cell beacon interference is
controlled by an appropriate reuse scheme.

solution to particle physics and cosmological fine-tuning problems (FTPs). Here
I explore the analogy between the Multiverse proposal and the proposal that
there exist an infinite number of stellar systems with planets in a flat
Universe, the Multiplanetverse. Although the measure problem is present in this
scenario, the idea of a Multiplanetverse has predictive power, even in the
absence of direct evidence for exoplanets that appeared since the 90s. We argue
that the fine-tuning of Earth to life (and not only the fine-tuning of life to
Earth) could predict with certainty the existence of exoplanets decades or even
centuries before that direct evidence. Several other predictions can be made by
studying only the Earth and the Sun, without any information about stars. The
analogy also shows that theories that defend that the Earth is the unique
existing planet and that, at the same time, is fine-tuned to life by pure
chance (or pure physical necessity from a parameter free Theory of Everything)
are misguided, and alike opinions about our Universe are similarly delusional.

action within $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, where $T$ and $\mathcal{T}$ denote
the torsion scalar and the trace of the energy momentum tensor, respectively.
We particularly focus our attention on the case where the algebraic function
$f(T,\mathcal{T})$ is decomposed as a sum of two functions $f_1(T)$ and
$f_2(\mathcal{T})$, i.e, $f(T,\mathcal{T})=f_{1}(T)+f_{2}(\mathcal{T})$. The
description is essentially based on the scale factor and then, we consider two
interesting and realistic expressions of this parameter and reconstruct the
action corresponding to each phase of the universe. Our results show that some
$f(T,\mathcal{T})$ models are able to describe the evolution of the universe
from the inflation phase to the late time dark energy dominated phase.

  networks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1410.1997",,,,"cs.SI math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the global clustering
coefficient in scale-free graphs. Many observed real-world networks of diverse
nature have a power-law degree distribution. Moreover, the observed degree
distribution usually has an infinite variance. Therefore, we are especially
interested in such degree distributions. In addition, we analyze the clustering
coefficient for both weighted and unweighted graphs.
  There are two well-known definitions of the clustering coefficient of a
graph: the global and the average local clustering coefficients. There are
several models proposed in the literature for which the average local
clustering coefficient tends to a positive constant as a graph grows. On the
other hand, there are no models of scale-free networks with an infinite
variance of the degree distribution and with an asymptotically constant global
clustering coefficient. Models with constant global clustering and finite
variance were also proposed. Therefore, in this paper we focus only on the most
interesting case: we analyze the global clustering coefficient for graphs with
an infinite variance of the degree distribution.
  For unweighted graphs, we prove that the global clustering coefficient tends
to zero with high probability and we also estimate the largest possible
clustering coefficient for such graphs. On the contrary, for weighted graphs,
the constant global clustering coefficient can be obtained even for the case of
an infinite variance of the degree distribution.

defined, it appears in well-known cases in quantum mechanics, such as the
double-slit experiment, the Bell-EPR experiment, and the Kochen-Specker
theorem. Here we examine contextuality in such cases, and discuss how each of
