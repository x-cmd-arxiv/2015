Chromo-Weibel instability on the dynamics of a heavy-quark (HQ) traversing in
the QGP medium is investigated within the framework of kinetic theory by
studying the momentum and temperature behavior of HQ drag and diffusion
coefficients. The physics of anisotropy is captured in an effective Vlasov term
in the transport equation. The effects of the instability are handled by making
a relation with the phenomenologically known jet quenching parameter in RHIC

temperature and momentum dependences of the HQ drag and diffusion coefficients.
These results may have appreciable impact on the experimental observables such
as, the nuclear suppression factor, $R_{AA}(p_T)$, and the elliptic flow,
$v_2(p_T)$, of heavy mesons in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies

scatter in mass at fixed richness is $\sigma_{\ln M|\lambda} =

that our model provides an adequate description of the matched sample, showing
that the fraction of SPT-SZ selected clusters with RM counterparts is
consistent with expectations and that the fraction of RM selected clusters with
SPT-SZ counterparts is in mild tension with expectation. We model the

Gaussians, showing that it is consistent with a dominant, centrally peaked
population and a sub-dominant population characterized by larger offsets. We
also cross-match the RM catalog with SPT-SZ candidates below the official
catalog threshold significance $\xi=4.5$, using the RM catalog to provide
optical confirmation and redshifts for additional low-$\xi$ SPT-SZ
candidates.In this way, we identify 15 additional clusters with $\xi\in

perspectives into how we design the next generation networks, where the number
of base stations/access points as well as the devices per subscriber will be
dramatically higher. In such dense environments, devices can communicate with
each other directly and can attach to multiple base stations (or access points)
for simultaneous data communication over multiple paths. This paper explores
how networks can maximally enable this multi-path diversity through network
programmability. In particular, we propose programmable flow clustering and set
policies for inter-group as well as intra-group wireless scheduling. Further,
we propose programmable demultiplexing of a single network flow onto multiple
paths before the congestion areas and multiplexing them together post
congestion areas. We show the benefits of such programmability first for legacy
applications that cannot take advantage of multi-homing without such
programmability. We then evaluate the benefits for smart applications that take
advantage of multi-homing by either opening multiple TCP connections over
multiple paths or utilizing a transport protocol such as MP-TCP designed for
supporting such environments. More specifically, we built an emulation
environment over Mininet for our experiments. Our evaluations using synthetic
and trace driven channel models indicate that the proposed programmability in
wireless scheduling and flow splitting can increase the throughput
substantially for both the legacy applications and the current state of the
art.

transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). This work
presents an exploratory lattice QCD study of a TMD observable in the pion
describing the Boer-Mulders effect, which is related to polarized quark
transverse momentum in an unpolarized hadron. Particular emphasis is placed on
the behavior as a function of a Collins-Soper evolution parameter quantifying
the relative rapidity of the struck quark and the initial hadron, e.g., in a
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process. The lattice
calculation, performed at the pion mass m_pi = 518 MeV, utilizes a definition
of TMDs via hadronic matrix elements of a quark bilocal operator with a
staple-shaped gauge connection; in this context, the evolution parameter is
related to the staple direction. By parametrizing the aforementioned matrix
elements in terms of invariant amplitudes, the problem can be cast in a Lorentz
frame suited for the lattice calculation. In contrast to an earlier nucleon
study, due to the lower mass of the pion, the calculated data enable
quantitative statements about the physically interesting limit of large
relative rapidity. In passing, the similarity between the Boer-Mulders effects
extracted in the pion and the nucleon is noted.

not include the origin. By providing an explicit formula, we show that for
planar symmetrically distributed random walks, $p_n$ does not depend on the
distribution of increments. This extends the well known result by Sparre
Andersen (1949) that a one-dimensional random walk satisfying the above
continuity and symmetry assumptions stays positive with a distribution-free
probability. We also find the asymptotics of $p_n$ as $n \to \infty$ for any
planar random walk with zero mean square-integrable increments.
  We further developed our approach from the planar case to study a wide class
of geometric characteristics of convex hulls of random walks in any dimension
$d \ge 2$. In particular, we give formulas for the expected value of the number
of faces, the volume, the surface area, and other intrinsic volumes, including
the following multidimensional generalization of the Spitzer--Widom formula
(1961) on the perimeter of planar walks: $$ E V_1 (conv(0, S_1, \dots, S_n)) =
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{E \|S_k\|}{k}, $$ where $V_1$ denotes the first intrinsic
volume, which is proportional to the mean width.
  These results have applications to geometry, and in particular, imply the
formula by Gao and Vitale (2001) for the intrinsic volumes of special
path-simplexes, called canonical orthoschemes, which are finite-dimensional
approximations of the closed convex hull of a Wiener spiral. Moreover, there is
a direct connection between spherical intrinsic volumes of these simplexes and
the probabilities $p_n$.
  We also prove similar results for convex hulls of random walk bridges, and
more generally, for partial sums of exchangeable random vectors.

a linear collider which can be operated at energies up to 500 GeV. This report
summarizes the outcome of a study of possible running scenarios, including a
realistic estimate of the real time accumulation of integrated luminosity based
on ramp-up and upgrade processes. The evolution of the physics outcomes is
emphasized, including running initially at 500 GeV, then at 350 GeV and 250
GeV. The running scenarios have been chosen to optimize the Higgs precision
measurements and top physics while searching for evidence for signals beyond
the standard model, including dark matter. In addition to the certain precision
physics on the Higgs and top that is the main focus of this study, there are
scientific motivations that indicate the possibility for discoveries of new
particles in the upcoming operations of the LHC or the early operation of the
ILC. Follow-up studies of such discoveries could alter the plan for the
centre-of-mass collision energy of the ILC and expand the scientific impact of
the ILC physics program. It is envisioned that a decision on a possible energy
upgrade would be taken near the end of the twenty year period considered in
this report.

defects which result in an increasing Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI) that
causes spurious image trailing. Most of the trailing can be corrected during
post-processing, by modelling the charge trapping and moving electrons back to
where they belong. However, such correction is not perfect -- and damage is
continuing to accumulate in orbit. To aid future development, we quantify the
limitations of current approaches, and determine where imperfect knowledge of
model parameters most degrade measurements of photometry and morphology. As a
concrete application, we simulate $1.5\times10^{9}$ ""worst case"" galaxy and
$1.5\times10^{8}$ star images to test the performance of the Euclid visual
instrument detectors. There are two separable challenges: If the model used to
correct CTI is perfectly the same as that used to add CTI, $99.68$ % of
spurious ellipticity is corrected in our setup. This is because readout noise
is not subject to CTI, but gets over-corrected during correction. Second, if we
assume the first issue to be solved, knowledge of the charge trap density
within $\Delta\rho/\rho\!=\!(0.0272\pm0.0005)$ %, and the characteristic
release time of the dominant species to be known within
$\Delta\tau/\tau\!=\!(0.0400\pm0.0004)$ % will be required. This work presents
the next level of definition of in-orbit CTI calibration procedures for Euclid.

finite. The gate-voltage variation of superconductivity is resolved in
different pairing channels, compared with experimental results and found to
match quite well. Interestingly, an enhancement of the superconducting
transition temperature by external in-plane magnetic field is found revealing
the existence of a hidden superconducting state above the observed one. As the
interface is known to possess high level of inhomogeneity, we explore the role
of non-magnetic disorder incorporating thermal phase fluctuations by using a

localised solutions are characterised by collective oscillations at the lattice

comparison principle for differential equations to demonstrate that at each
lattice site every half of the fundamental period of oscillations, contributing
to localised solutions of the nonlinear lattice, is sandwiched between two
oscillatory states of auxiliary linear equations. For soft (hard) on-site

prescribed to different physical scenarios -- NS-NS or NS-BH mergers, and
collapse of massive stars, for short and long GRBs, respectively. The existence
of two distinct populations was inferred through a bimodal distribution of the
observed durations $T_{90}$, and the commonly applied $2\,{\rm s}$ limit
between short and long GRBs was obtained by fitting a parabola between the two
peaks in binned data from BATSE 1B. Herein, by means of a maximum likelihood
(ML) method a mixture of two Gaussians is fitted to the datasets from BATSE,
$Swift$, $BeppoSAX$, and $Fermi$ in search for a local minimum that might serve
as a new, more proper, limit for the two GRB classes. It is found that $Swift$
and $BeppoSAX$ distributions are unimodal, hence no local minimum is present,
$Fermi$ is consistent with the conventional limit, whereas BATSE gives the
limit significantly longer (equal to $3.38\pm 0.27\,{\rm s}$) than $2\,{\rm
s}$. These new values change the fractions of short and long GRBs in the
samples examined, and imply that the observed $T_{90}$ durations are detector
dependent, hence no universal limiting value may be applied to all satellites
due to their different instrument specifications. Because of this, and due to
the strong overlap of the two-Gaussian components, the straightforward
association of short GRBs to mergers and long ones to collapsars is ambiguous.

in a variety of applications, including covariance sketching of
high-dimensional data streams, quadratic regression, quantum state tomography,
among others. A natural approach to this problem is to minimize the loss
function $f(U) = \sum_i (y_i - a_i^TUU^Ta_i)^2$ which has an entire manifold of
solutions given by $\{XO\}_{O\in\mathcal{O}_r}$ where $\mathcal{O}_r$ is the

isotropic gaussian $a_i$, with high probability {\em (a)} this function admits
a dimension-independent region of {\em local strong convexity} on lines
perpendicular to the solution manifold, and {\em (b)} with an additional
polynomial factor of $r$ samples, a simple spectral initialization will land
within the region of convexity with high probability. Together, this implies
that gradient descent with initialization (but no re-sampling) will converge
linearly to the correct $X$, up to an orthogonal transformation. We believe
that this general technique (local convexity reachable by spectral

propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma by investigating the
thermalization of the soft components of the jet. We argue that the following
scenario should hold: the leading particle emits a significant number of
mini-jets which promptly evolve via quasi-democratic branchings and thus
degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the order of the medium
temperature T. Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft
gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale
which is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet. The
thermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind the hard components of the
jet. We support this scenario, first, via parametric arguments and, next, by
studying a simplified kinetic equation, which describes the jet dynamics in
longitudinal phase-space. We solve the kinetic equation using both
(semi-)analytical and numerical methods. In particular, we obtain the first
exact, analytic, solutions to the ultrarelativistic Fokker-Planck equation in
one-dimensional phase-space. Our results confirm the physical picture
aforementioned and demonstrate the quenching of the jet via multiple branching

correspond to two flat, infinite, parallel planes, one of them static and
imposing perfect conductor boundary conditions, while the other performs a
rigid oscillatory motion. The systems differ just in the electrical properties
of the oscillating plane: one of them is just a planar dipole layer
(representing, for instance, a small-width electret). The other, instead, has a
dipole layer on the side which faces the static plane, but behaves as a
conductor on the other side: this can be used as a representation of a
conductor endowed with patch potentials (on the side which faces the conducting
plane). We evaluate, in both cases, the dissipative flux of energy between the
system and its environment, showing that, at least for small mechanical
oscillation amplitudes, it can be written in terms of the dipole layer
autocorrelation function. We show that there are resonances as a function of
the frequency of the mechanical oscillation.

unconventional quantum statistics determines a set of global symmetries (e.g.,
fermion parity for Majoranas) admitting no relevant perturbations. Any operator
that breaks these symmetries explicitly would violate locality if added to the
the Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the associated quasi-degeneracy of
topologically non-trivial phases is protected, at least partially, by locality

possible to bypass this type of protection by way of specifically engineered

ideas in a concrete setting, we focus on the \(\Z_6\) parafermion chain.
Starting in the topological phase of the chain (sixfold ground degeneracy), we
show that a gauge field with restricted dynamics acts as a relevant
perturbation, driving a transition to a phase with threefold degeneracy and
\(\Z_3\) parafermion edge modes. The transition from the \(\Z_3\) to the
topologically trivial phase occurs on a critical line in the three-state Potts

significantly variable ($\Delta f/f$ 10% on 100-day timescales), a necessary

confirm that continuum variability increases with timescale and decreases with

order to formulate the most effective experimentally feasible protocol, we
introduce the notion of average sense locally optimal (ASLO) feedback
protocols, which do not require real-time quantum state estimation, a difficult
component of real-time quantum feedback control. We use this notion of
optimality to construct two protocols which can deterministically create
maximal entanglement: a semiclassical feedback protocol for low efficiency
measurements and a quantum feedback protocol for high efficiency measurements.
The latter reduces to direct feedback in the continuous-time limit, whose
dynamics can be modeled by a Wiseman-Milburn feedback master equation which
yields an analytic solution in the limit of unit measurement efficiency. Our
formalism can smoothly interpolate between continuous-time and discrete-time
descriptions of feedback dynamics, and we exploit this feature to then derive a
superior hybrid protocol for arbitrary non-unit measurement efficiency that
switches between quantum and semiclassical protocols. Finally, we show using
simulations incorporating experimental imperfections that deterministic

pc of the Milky Way. K-band spectroscopy of these stars were obtained with the

the MARCS synthetic spectral grid, we find that there is large variation in
metallicity, with stars ranging from [M/H] $<$ -1.0 to above solar metallicity.
About 6\% of the stars have [M/H] $<$ -0.5. This result is in contrast to
previous observations, with smaller samples, that show stars at the Galactic
center have approximately solar metallicity with only small variations. Our
current measurement uncertainties are dominated by systematics in the model,
especially at [M/H] $>$ 0, where there are stellar lines not represented in the
model. However, the conclusion that there are low metallicity stars, as well as
large variations in metallicity is robust. The metallicity may be an indicator
of the origin of these stars. The low-metallicity population is consistent with
that of globular clusters in the Milky Way, but their small fraction likely
means that globular cluster infall is not the dominant mechanism for forming
the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. The majority of stars are at or above solar
metallicity, which suggests they were formed closer to the Galactic center or
from the disk. In addition, our results indicate that it will be important for
star formation history analyses using red giants at the Galactic center to

with a Mach number of 1.26 are passed through SF$_6$ bands, resulting in
transition to turbulence driven by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. The
system is followed as a rarefaction wave and a reflected secondary shock from
the back wall pass through the SF$_6$ band. We apply a variety of initial
perturbations to the interfaces between the two fluids in which the physical
standard deviation, wave number range, and the spectral slope of the
perturbations are held constant, but the number of modes initially present is
varied. By thus decreasing the density of initial spectral modes of the

effects, neutral collisions and anomalous transport is investigated using the
XGC0 code. The XGC0 code includes realistic X-point geometry, a neutral source
model, the effects of collisions, and a diffusion model for anomalous
transport. It is observed that width of the XGC0 neoclassical heat-load is
approximately inversely proportional to the total plasma current $I_{\rm p}$.
The scaling of the width of the divertor heat-load with plasma current is
examined for an Alcator C-Mod discharge and four DIII-D discharges. The scaling
of the divertor heat-load width with plasma current is found to be weaker in
the Alcator C-Mod discharge compared to scaling found in the DIII-D discharges.
The effect of neutral collisions on the $1/I_{\rm p}$ scaling of heat-load
width is shown not to be significant. Although inclusion of poloidally uniform
anomalous transport results in a deviation from the $1/I_{\rm p}$ scaling, the
inclusion of the anomalous transport that is driven by ballooning-type
instabilities results in recovering the neoclassical $1/I_{\rm p}$ scaling. The
Bohm or Gyro-Bohm scalings of anomalous transport does not strongly affect the
dependence of the heat-load width on plasma current. The inclusion of anomalous
transport, in general, results in widening the width of neoclassical divertor
heat-load and enhances the neoclassical heat-load fluxes on the divertor
plates. Understanding heat transport in the tokamak scrape-off layer plasmas is
important for strengthening the basis for predicting divertor conditions in

convection) refers to a type of double diffusive instability that occurs in
regions of planetary and stellar interiors which have a destabilizing thermal
stratification and a stabilizing mean molecular weight stratification. In this
series of papers, we use an extensive suite of three-dimensional (3D) numerical
simulations to quantify the transport of heat and chemical species by ODDC.
Rosenblum et al. (2011) first showed that ODDC can either spontaneously form
layers, which significantly enhance the transport of heat and chemical species
compared to mi- croscopic transport, or remain in a state dominated by large
scale gravity waves, in which there is a more modest enhancement of the
turbulent transport rates. Subsequent studies in this series have focused on
identifying under what condi- tions layers form (Mirouh et al. 2012), and
quantifying transport through layered systems (Wood et al. 2013). Here we
proceed to characterize transport through systems that are unstable to the ODDC
instability, but do not undergo spon- taneous layer formation. We measure the
thermal and compositional fluxes in non-layered ODDC from both 2D and 3D
numerical simulations and show that 3D simulations are well approximated by
similar simulations in a 2D domain. We find that the turbulent mixing rate in
this regime is weak and can, to a first level approximation, be neglected. We
conclude by summarizing the findings of papers I through III into a single
prescription for transport by ODDC.

with multiple selective optima and hypotheses with rate variation within and
across lineages. The statistical performance of these sophisticated models has
received relatively little systematic attention, however. We conducted an
extensive simulation study to quantify the statistical properties of a class of
models toward the simpler end of the spectrum that model phenotypic evolution
using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We focused on identifying where, how, and
why these methods break down so that users can apply them with greater
understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. Our analysis identifies three
key determinants of performance: a discriminability ratio, a signal-to-noise
ratio, and the number of taxa sampled. Interestingly, we find that
model-selection power can be high even in regions that were previously thought
to be difficult, such as when tree size is small. On the other hand, we find
that model parameters are in many circumstances difficult to estimate
accurately, indicating a relative paucity of information in the data relative

considerable attention for next-generation cellular networks due to vast

are extremely vulnerable to shadowing and poor high-frequency propagation.
Multi-hop relaying is therefore a natural technology for such systems to
improve cell range and cell edge rates without the addition of wired access
points. This paper studies the problem of scheduling for a simple
infrastructure cellular relay system where communication between wired base
stations and User Equipment follow a hierarchical tree structure through fixed
relay nodes. Such a systems builds naturally on existing cellular mmW backhaul
by adding mmW in the access links. A key feature of the proposed system is that
TDD duplexing selections can be made on a link-by-link basis due to directional
isolation from other links. We devise an efficient, greedy algorithm for
centralized scheduling that maximizes network utility by jointly optimizing the
duplexing schedule and resources allocation for dense, relay-enhanced OFDMA/TDD
mmW networks. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adapt to loading, channel
conditions and traffic demands. Significant throughput gains and improved
resource utilization offered by our algorithm over the static,
globally-synchronized TDD patterns are demonstrated through simulations based

that dust grains are a more efficient coolant than gas although gas cooling may
not be negligible. The IRX ratios of the LMC SNRs are systematically lower than
those of the Galactic SNRs. As both dust cooling and gas cooling pertain to the
properties of the interstellar medium, the lower IRX ratios of the LMC SNRs may
reflect the characteristics of the LMC, and the lower dust-to- gas ratio (a

observed IRX ratios are compared with theoretical predictions that yield IRX
ratios an order of magnitude larger. This discrepancy may originate from the
dearth of dust in the remnants due to either the local variation of the dust
abundance in the preshock medium with respect to the canonical abundance or the
dust destruction in the postshock medium. The non-equilibrium ionization

point out that a large number of these proposals rely, at least implicitly, on
the assumption of `closure' (or `partial closure') of the laws of Physics. I.e.
the assumption that laws of Physics as they are known today are either complete
(and hence closed) or that they possess features that a hypothetical future
`complete' theory must share (and hence are partially closed). Given that the
assumption of closure of laws of Physics can never be verified operationally,
it cannot justifiably be used to support the claim for non-existence of time.
  Some approaches against time are `timeless' at the primary level for the
universe as a whole. In these approaches time arises at a secondary level,
mostly in the sense of `time being abstracted from change'. On the other hand,
there are other approaches that deny the existence of time altogether. We argue
that metaphysical arguments of this type - similar to those based on closure -
by implicitly implying the absence of history, are by their nature circular.

for possible application to spintronic circuits because of its strong spin
orbit coupling. TIs are unique materials that have an insulating bulk but
conducting surface states due to band inversion and these surface states are
protected by time reversal symmetry. In this paper, we propose a physics-based
spin dynamics simulation framework for TI/Ferromagnet (TI/FM) bilayer
heterostructures that is able to capture the electronic band structure of a TI
while calculating the electron and spin transport properties. Our model differs
from TI/FM models proposed in the literature in that it is able to account for
the 3D band structure of TIs and the effect of exchange coupling and external
magnetic field on the band structure. Our proposed approach uses 2D surface
Hamiltonian for TIs that includes all necessary features for spin transport
calculations so as to properly model the characteristics of a TI/FM
heterostructure. Using this Hamiltonian and appropriate parameters, we show
that the effect of quantum confinement and exchange coupling are successfully
captured in the calculated surface band structure compared with the quantum
well band diagram of a 3D TI, and matches well with experimental data reported
in the literature. We then show how this calibrated Hamiltonian is used with
the self-consistent non equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) formalism to
determine the charge and spin transport in TI/FM bilayer heterostructures. Our
calculations agree well with experimental data and capture the unique features
of a TI/FM heterostructure such as high spin Hall angle, high spin conductivity
etc. Finally, we show how the results obtained from NEGF calculations may be
incorporated into the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) formulation to
simulate the magnetization dynamics of an FM layer sitting on top of a TI.

platform---Intel Xeon E5645, we compare the representative big data workloads
with SPECINT, SPECCFP, PARSEC, CloudSuite and HPCC. After a comprehensive
workload characterization, we have the following observations. First, the big
data workloads are data movement dominated computing with more branch
operations, taking up to 92% percentage in terms of instruction mix, which
places them in a different class from Desktop (SPEC CPU2006), CMP (PARSEC), HPC
(HPCC) workloads. Second, corroborating the previous work, Hadoop and Spark
based big data workloads have higher front-end stalls. Comparing with the
traditional workloads i. e. PARSEC, the big data workloads have larger

efficiencies among different big data workloads. Third, we found complex
software stacks that fail to use state-of-practise processors efficiently are
one of the main factors leading to high front-end stalls. For the same

observed in regular flux measurements of compact extragalactic sources. They
are characterized by a flux variation over a period of weeks, suggesting the
passage of a ""diverging plasma lens"" across the line of sight. Modeling the
refraction of such a lens indicates that the structure size must be of order AU
and the electron density of order 10s of cm^{-3}. Similar structures have been
observed in measurements of pulsar intensity scintillation and group delay.
Here we report observations of two ESEs showing increases in both intensity
scintillation and dispersion made with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA).
These allow us to make more complete models of the ESE, including an estimate
of the ""outer-scale"" of the turbulence in the plasma lens. These observations
show clearly that the ESE structure is fully turbulent on an AU scale. They
provide some support for the idea that the structures are extended along the
line of sight, such as would be the case for a scattering shell. The dispersion
measurements also show a variety of AU scale structures which would not be
called ESEs, yet involve electron density variations typical of ESEs and likely
have the same origin.

function. Large-scale explicit solvent simulations coupled to experimental

important insights into the structure and energetics of such atmospheres but
are time- and resource-intensive. In this paper, we use classical density
functional theory (cDFT) to explore the balance between ion-DNA, ion-water, and
ion-ion interactions in ionic atmospheres of RbCl, SrCl$_2$, and CoHexCl$_3$
(cobalt hexammine chloride) around a B-form DNA molecule. The accuracy of the
cDFT calculations was assessed by comparison between simulated and experimental
ASAXS curves, demonstrating that an accurate model should take into account
ion-ion correlation and ion hydration forces, DNA topology, and the discrete
distribution of charges on DNA strands. As expected, these calculations
revealed significant differences between monovalent, divalent, and trivalent
cation distributions around DNA. About half of the DNA-bound Rb$^+$ ions
penetrate into the minor groove of the DNA and half adsorb on the DNA strands.
The fraction of cations in the minor groove decreases for the larger Sr$^{2+}$
ions and becomes zero for CoHex$^{3+}$ ions, which all adsorb on the DNA
strands. The distribution of CoHex$^{3+}$ ions is mainly determined by Coulomb
and steric interactions, while ion-correlation forces play a central role in
the monovalent Rb$^+$ distribution and a combination of ion-correlation and
hydration forces affect the Sr$^{2+}$ distribution around DNA.

need for such protocol arises due to conflicting requirements (e.g., access to
the system should be restricted but emergency access should be provided). One
can design such systems with a tamper detection approach (based on the
intuition of ""break the glass door""). However, in a distributed system, such
tampering, which are denoted as auditable events, is visible only for a single
node. This is unacceptable since the actions they take in these situations can
be different than those in the normal mode. Moreover, eventually, the auditable
event needs to be cleared so that system resumes the normal operation.
  With this motivation, in this paper, we present a protocol for auditable
restoration, where any process can potentially identify an auditable event.
Whenever a new auditable event occurs, the system must reach an ""auditable
state"" where every process is aware of the auditable event. Only after the
system reaches an auditable state, it can begin the operation of restoration.
Although any process can observe an auditable event, we require that only
""authorized"" processes can begin the task of restoration. Moreover, these
processes can begin the restoration only when the system is in an auditable
state. Our protocol is self-stabilizing and has bounded state space. It can
effectively handle the case where faults or auditable events occur during the
restoration protocol. Moreover, it can be used to provide auditable restoration
to other distributed protocol.

the Coil to Globule transition of linear homopolymers. The temperature at which

temperature depends on the chosen lattices. The value of theta temperature for
ISAW on FCC lattice is reported as $6.46$ in a simulation study [J. Chem. Phys.

chains with over 2000 monomers. In this paper, we present a method that gives a
reliable estimate of the theta temperature of ISAW on FCC lattice using chains
of shorter walk lengths (less than 100 monomers). We compute density states of
ISAW on FCC lattice by employing growth walk algorithm and then we use the
recently introduced pseudo order parameter method to estimate the theta
temperature. The value obtained from our method agrees very well with latter
reported result of $7.614$. In order to corroborate our result we also estimate
the theta temperature using the celebrated partition function zeroes method.

selection issue by extending Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference to
FHMMs. First, we offer a better approximation of marginal log-likelihood than
the previous FAB inference. Our key idea is to integrate out transition
probabilities, yet still apply the Laplace approximation to emission
probabilities. Second, we prove that if there are two very similar hidden
states in an FHMM, i.e. one is redundant, then FAB will almost surely shrink
and eliminate one of them, making the model parsimonious. Experimental results
show that FAB for FHMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
nonparametric Bayesian iFHMM and Variational FHMM in model selection accuracy,

$B$(E3) strengths are substantially damped near the touching point, because the

parallel jobs in a parallel system. Scheduling parallel jobs is performed as a
means to balance the load of a system in order to improve the performance of a
parallel application. Parallel job scheduling is presented as a mapping between
two graphs: one represents the dependency of jobs and the other represents the
interconnection among processors. The usual implementation of parallel job
scheduling algorithms is via the master-slave paradigm. The master-slave
paradigm has inherent communication bottleneck that reduces the performance of
the system when more processors are needed to process the jobs. The multiagent
approach attempts to distribute the communication latency among the processors
which improves the performance of the system as the number of participating
processors increases. Presented in this paper is a framework for the behavior
of an autonomous agent that cooperates with other agents to achieve a community
goal of minimizing the processing time. Achieving this goal means an agent must
truthfully share information with other agents via {\em normalization}, {\em
task sharing}, and {\em result sharing} procedures. The agents consider a
parallel scientific application as a finite-horizon game where truthful
information sharing results into performance improvement for the parallel
application. The performance of the multiagent-based algorithm is compared to
that of an existing one via a simulation of the wavepacket dynamics using the
quantum trajectory method (QTM) as a test application. The average parallel
cost of running the QTM using the multiagent-based system is lower at higher

particular, the intensity of the central peak in the fluorescence spectrum
becomes a function of the electron coherence, allowing access to the coherence
time of a two dimensional electron gas through a fluorescence intensity

given by the relative entropy of coherence (in other words, we give the
relative entropy of coherence its operational interpretation), and the
coherence cost by the coherence of formation, which is an optimization over
convex decompositions of the state.
  An immediate corollary is that there exists no bound coherent state in the
sense that one would need to consume coherence to create the state but no
coherence could be distilled from it. Further we demonstrate that the coherence
theory is generically an irreversible theory by a simple criterion that
completely characterizes all reversible states.

of different genes (loci) do not display precisely matched topologies. This
phylogenetic incongruence is attributed to the reticulated evolutionary history
of most species due to meiotic sexual recombination in eukaryotes, or
horizontal transfers of genetic materials in prokaryotes. Nonetheless, most
genes do display topologically related phylogenies; this implies they form
cohesive subsets (clusters). In this work, we compare popular clustering
methods, and show how the performance of the normalized cut framework is
efficient and statistically accurate when obtaining clusters on the set of gene
trees based on the geodesic distance between them over the
Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) tree space. We proceed to present a computational
study on the performance of different clustering methods with and without
preprocessing under different distance metrics and using a series of dimension
reduction techniques. Results: First, we show using simulated data that indeed
the Ncut framework accurately clusters the set of gene trees given a species
tree under the coalescent process. We then depict the success of our framework
by comparing its performance to other clustering techniques, including k-means
and hierarchical clustering. The main computational results can be summarized
to the stellar performance of the Ncut framework even without dimension
reduction, the similar performance portrayed by k-means and Ncut under most
dimension reduction schemes, the utter failure of hierarchical clustering to
accurately capture clusters, as well as the significantly better performance of
the NJp method, as compared to MLE.

mean-field behavior by proving that the infrared bound holds, in turn implying
the finiteness of the percolation triangle diagram. The finiteness of the
triangle implies the existence and mean-field values of various critical
exponents, such as $\gamma=1, \beta=1, \delta=2$. We also prove sharp $x$-space
asymptotics for the two-point function and the existence of various arm
exponents. Such results had previously been obtained in unpublished work by
Hara and Slade for nearest-neighbor percolation in dimension $d\geq 19$, so
that we bring the dimension above which mean-field behavior is rigorously
proved down from $19$ to $11$. Our results also imply sharp bounds on the
critical value of nearest-neighbor percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, which are
provably at most $1.306\%$ off in $d=11$. We make use of the general method
analyzed in the accompanying paper ""Generalized approach to the
non-backtracking lace expansion"" by Fitzner and van der Hofstad, which proposes
to use a lace expansion perturbing around non-backtracking random walk. This
proof is {\em computer-assisted}, relying on (1) rigorous numerical upper
bounds on various simple random walk integrals as proved by Hara and Slade
(1992) and (2) a verification that the derived numerical conditions hold true.
These two ingredients are implemented in two Mathematica notebooks that can be
downloaded from the website of the first author. The main steps of this paper
are (a) to derive a non-backtracking lace expansion for the percolation
two-point function; (b) to bound the non-backtracking lace expansion
coefficients, thus showing that the general methodology applies, and (c) to
describe the numerical bounds on the coefficients. In the appendix of this

dominant part of the event yield in large-volume underground particle
detectors. The IceCube detector, with an instrumented volume of about a cubic
kilometer, has the potential to conduct unique investigations on atmospheric
muons by exploiting the large collection area and the possibility to track
particles over a long distance. Through detailed reconstruction of energy
deposition along the tracks, the characteristics of muon bundles can be
quantified, and individual particles of exceptionally high energy identified.
The data can then be used to constrain the cosmic ray primary flux and the
contribution to atmospheric lepton fluxes from prompt decays of short-lived
hadrons.
  In this paper, techniques for the extraction of physical measurements from
atmospheric muon events are described and first results are presented. The
multiplicity spectrum of TeV muons in cosmic ray air showers for primaries in
the energy range from the knee to the ankle is derived and found to be
consistent with recent results from surface detectors. The single muon energy
spectrum is determined up to PeV energies and shows a clear indication for the
emergence of a distinct spectral component from prompt decays of short-lived
hadrons. The magnitude of the prompt flux, which should include a substantial
contribution from light vector meson di-muon decays, is consistent with current
theoretical predictions.

use the VIDE toolkit to identify voids in mock galaxy populations embedded

We compare the resulting void populations to assess the impact on void
properties. We find that void abundances and spherically-averaged radial
density profiles are mildly affected by peculiar velocities. However, peculiar
velocities can distort by up to 10% the shapes for a particular subset of voids
depending on the void size and density contrast, which can lead to increased
variance in Alcock-Paczy\'nski test. We offer guidelines for performing optimal
cuts on the void catalogue to reduce this variance by removing the most
severely affected voids while preserving the unaffected ones. In addition,
since this shape distortion is largely limited to the line of sight, we show
that the void radii are only affected at the $\sim$ 10% level and the
macrocenter positions at the $\sim$ 20% (even before performing cuts), meaning
that cosmological probes based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe and gravitational
lensing are not severely impacted by peculiar velocities.

activity beyond a zone where water ice sublimation is negligible (up to 5 AU).
Significant spatial variations both in the intensity and polarization are found
in both comets. The slope of radial profiles of intensity changes gradually
with the distance from the photocenter: from - 0.7 near the nucleus up to about
- 1.3 for larger distances (up to 100000 km). The variation in polarization
profiles indicates the non uniformity in the polarization distribution over the
coma. The polarization degree over the coma gradually increases (in absolute
value) with increasing the photocentric distance from of about - 1.9% up to -
3% for comet C/2010 S1 (LINEAR), and from of about - 2.5% up to - 3.5% for

quantum counter concept. Its operation consists of a two-step excitation
process of a four level system, that can be realized in rare earth-doped
crystals when a cw pump laser is tuned to the transition from the second to the
fourth level. The incident particle raises the atoms of the active material
into a low lying, metastable energy state, triggering the absorption of the
pump laser to a higher level. Following a rapid non-radiative decay to a
fluorescent level, an optical signal is observed with a conventional detectors.
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of such a scheme, we have investigated
the emission from the fluorescent level $^4$S$_{3/2}$ (540 nm band) in an
Er$^{3+}$-doped YAG crystal pumped by a tunable titanium sapphire laser when it
is irradiated with 60 keV electrons delivered by an electron gun. We have

predictive modeling is important but challenging task. The difficulty lies in
the fact that, for a recent applications with high-dimensional covariates, the
number of possible high-order interaction features would be extremely large.
Identifying statistically significant features from such a huge pool of
candidates would be highly challenging both in computational and statistical
senses. To work with this problem, we consider a two stage algorithm where we
first select a set of high-order interaction features by marginal screening,
and then make statistical inferences on the regression model fitted only with
the selected features. Such statistical inferences are called post-selection
inference (PSI), and receiving an increasing attention in the literature. One
of the seminal recent advancements in PSI literature is the works by Lee et al.
where the authors presented an algorithmic framework for computing exact
sampling distributions in PSI. A main challenge when applying their approach to
our high-order interaction models is to cope with the fact that PSI in general
depends not only on the selected features but also on the unselected features,
making it hard to apply to our extremely high-dimensional high-order
interaction models. The goal of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by
introducing a novel efficient method for PSI. Our key idea is to exploit the
underlying tree structure among high-order interaction features, and to develop
a pruning method of the tree which enables us to quickly identify a group of
unselected features that are guaranteed to have no influence on PSI. The
experimental results indicate that the proposed method allows us to reliably
identify statistically significant high-order interaction features with
reasonable computational cost.

create three-mode entanglement by acting on two modes of a three-mode fully

many practical regression problems. This is, however, computationally
challenging task because the number of high-order interaction features to be
considered would be extremely large unless the number of covariates is
sufficiently small. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient algorithm for
LASSO-based sparse learning of such high-order interaction models. Our basic
strategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently
proposed safe feature screening (SFS) rule. An SFS rule has a property that, if
a feature satisfies the rule, then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active
in the LASSO solution, meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the
LASSO training process. If a large number of features can be screened-out
before training the LASSO, the computational cost and the memory requirment can
be dramatically reduced. However, applying such an SFS rule to each of the
extremely large number of high-order interaction features would be
computationally infeasible. Our key idea for solving this computational issue
is to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction
features. Specifically, we introduce a pruning condition called safe feature
pruning (SFP) rule which has a property that, if the rule is satisfied in a
certain node of the tree, then all the high-order interaction features
corresponding to its descendant nodes can be guaranteed to be non-active at the
optimal solution. Our algorithm is extremely efficient, making it possible to
work, e.g., with 3rd order interactions of 10,000 original covariates, where
the number of possible high-order interaction features is greater than 10^{12}.

the exact discovery of top-k sequential patterns under a given measure of
interest. Our interestingness measure employs the partition approach. A pattern
is interesting to the extent that it is more frequent than can be explained by
assuming independence between any of the pairs of patterns from which it can be
composed. The larger the support compared to the expectation under
independence, the more interesting is the pattern. We build on these two
elements to exactly extract the k sequential patterns with highest leverage,
consistent with our definition of expected support. We conduct experiments on
both synthetic data with known patterns and real-world datasets; both

provide fast statistical approximations to model physical processes. The
training of these surrogates depends on the set of design points chosen to run
the simulator. Due to computational cost, such training set is bound to be
limited and quantifying the resulting uncertainty in the hyper-parameters of
the emulator by uni-modal distributions is likely to induce bias. In order to
quantify this uncertainty, this paper proposes a computationally efficient
sampler based on an extension of Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling, a
recently developed algorithm for Bayesian inference. Structural uncertainty of
the emulator is obtained as a by-product of the Bayesian treatment of the
hyper-parameters. Additionally, the user can choose to perform stochastic
optimisation to sample from a neighbourhood of the Maximum a Posteriori
estimate, even in the presence of multimodality. Model uncertainty is also
acknowledged through numerical stabilisation measures by including a nugget
term in the formulation of the probability model. The efficiency of the
proposed sampler is illustrated in examples where multi-modal distributions are
encountered. For the purpose of reproducibility, further development, and use

studies of different -inequivalent- loop quantizations have shown, to date
there exists no fully satisfactory quantum theory for this model. This fact
poses challenges to the validity of some scenarios to address the black hole
information problem. Here we put forward a novel viewpoint to construct the
quantum theory that builds from some of the models available in the literature.
The final picture is a quantum theory that is both independent of any auxiliary
structure and possesses a correct low curvature limit. It represents a subtle
but non-trivial modification of the original prescription given by Ashtekar and
Bojowald. It is shown that the quantum gravitational constraint is well defined
past the singularity and that its effective dynamics possesses a bounce into an
expanding regime. The classical singularity is avoided, and a semiclassical
spacetime satisfying vacuum Einstein's equations is recovered on the ""other
side"" of the bounce. We argue that such metric represents the interior region
of a white-hole spacetime, but for which the corresponding ""white-hole mass""
differs from the original black hole mass. Furthermore, we find that the value
of the white-hole mass is proportional to the third power of the starting black
hole mass.

energies up to a few PeV heralds the beginning of neutrino astronomy. At such
high energies, the conventional neutrino flux is suppressed and the prompt
component from charm meson decays is expected to become the dominant background
to astrophysical neutrinos. Charm production at high energies is however
theoretically uncertain, both since the charm mass is at the boundary of
applicability of perturbative QCD, and also because the calculations are
sensitive to the poorly-known gluon PDF at small-x. In this work we provide
detailed perturbative QCD predictions for charm and bottom production in the
forward region, and validate them by comparing with recent data from the LHCb
experiment at 7 TeV. Finding good agreement between data and theory, we use the
LHCb measurements to constrain the small-x gluon PDF, achieving a substantial
reduction in its uncertainties. Using these improved PDFs, we provide
predictions for charm and bottom production at LHCb at 13 TeV, as well as for
the ratio of cross-sections between 13 and 7 TeV. The same calculations are
used to compute the energy distribution of neutrinos from charm decays in pA
collisions, a key ingredient towards achieving a theoretically robust estimate

2-homogenic rational functions, as vector fields, give rise to rational flows.
The main ingredient in the proof of the classifying theorem is a reduction
algorithm for a pair of 2-homogenic rational functions. This reduction method
in fact allows to derive more results.
  Namely, in this work we find all projective flows with rational vector fields
whose orbits are algebraic curves. We call these flows abelian projective
flows, since either these flows are parametrized by abelian functions and with
the help of 1-homogenic birational plane transformations (1-BIR) the orbits of
these flows can be transformed into algebraic curves
$x^{A}(x-y)^{B}y^{C}\equiv\mathrm{const.}$ (abelian flows of type I), or there
exists a 1-BIR which transforms the orbits into the lines
$y\equiv\mathrm{const.}$ (abelian flows of type II), and generally the latter
flows are described in terms of non-arithmetic functions.
  Our second result classifies all abelian flows which are given by two

finite-range interactions. Combining a strong-coupling expansion, the replica
method, and a one-loop renormalization group analysis, we investigate the
nature of the glass phases formed. We find that away from the tips of the Mott
lobes, the transition is from a Mott insulator to a compressible Bose glass,
however the compressibility at the tips is strongly suppressed. We identify
this finding with the presence of a rare Mott glass phase not previously
described by any analytic theory for this model and demonstrate that the
inclusion of replica symmetry breaking is vital to correctly describe the
glassy phases. This result suggests that the formation of Bose and Mott glass
phases is not simply a weak localization phenomenon but is indicative of much
richer physics. We discuss our results in the context of both ultracold atomic

logarithmic branch points, in the second case they both have branch points of
second order, and finally, in the third case they both have branch points of

  All three cases may be considered as representative of the asymptotic theory
of Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials. In the first two cases the numerical zero

evolution of the photospheric magnetic flux and the coronal structure, we find
that the flux emergence triggered the eruption by interaction with overlying
flux in a non-standard way. The new flux neither had the opposite orientation
nor a location near the polarity inversion line, which are favorable for strong
reconnection with the arcade flux under which it emerged. Moreover, its flux
content remained significantly smaller than that of the arcade (approximately
40 %). However, a loop system rooted in the trailing active region ran in part
under the arcade between the active regions, passing over the site of flux
emergence. The reconnection with the emerging flux, leading to a series of jet
emissions into the loop system, caused a strong but confined rise of the loop
system. This lifted the arcade between the two active regions, weakening its
downward tension force and thus destabilizing the considerably sheared flux
under the arcade. The complex event was also associated with supporting
precursor activity in an enhanced network near the active regions, acting on
the large-scale overlying flux, and with two simultaneous confined flares
within the active regions.

have been interpreted as the effect of relativistic beaming on the emission

amplification of the jet emission makes them ideal targets for studying jet
physics. In particular, low-power BL Lacs (LPBL) are very interesting because
they probe the jet formation and emission processes at the lowest levels of
accretion. However, they are difficult to identify since their emission is
swamped by the radiation from the host galaxy in most observing bands. In this
paper we propose a new LPBL selection method based on the mid-infrared
emission, in addition to the traditional optical indices. We considered the
radio-selected sample of Best & Heckman (2012, MNRAS, 421, 1569) and
cross-matched it with the WISE all-sky survey. In a new diagnostic plane
including the W2-W3 color and the Dn(4000) index, LPBL are located in a region
scarcely populated by other sources. By filtering objects with small emission
line equivalent width, we isolated 36 LPBL candidates up to redshift 0.15.
Their radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz spans the range log L_r = 39.2-41.5 [erg/s].
Considering the completeness of our sample, we analyzed the BL Lac luminosity
function (RLF), finding a dramatic paucity of LPBL with respect to the
extrapolation of the RLF toward low power. This requires a break in the RLF
located at log L_r~40.6 [erg/s]. The consequent peak in the BL Lacs number
density is possibly the manifestation of a minimum power required to launch a
relativistic jet.

worm-like chains, whose thermal bending fluctuations are restricted by the
leading edge cell membrane, resulting in an effective force. Branching can
increase the stiffness considerably; however the effect depends on branch point
position and filament orientation, being most pronounced for intermediate tilt
angles and intermediate branch point positions. We describe filament networks
without cross-linkers to focus on the effect of branching. We use randomly
positioned branch points, as generated in the process of treadmilling, and
orientation distributions as measured in lamellipodia. These networks reproduce
both the weak and strong force response of lamellipodia as measured in
force-velocity experiments. We compare properties of branched and unbranched
networks. The ratio of the network average of the force per branched filament
to the average force per unbranched filament depends on the orientation
distribution of the filaments. The ratio exhibits compression dependence and
may go up to about 4.5 in networks with a narrow orientation distribution. With
orientation distributions measured in lamellipodia, it is about two and

and prevention of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). Efficient strategies for the
extraction of information about ADRs from free text resources are essential to
support the work of experts, employed in the crucial task of detecting and
classifying unexpected pathologies possibly related to drug assumptions.
Narrative ADR descriptions may be collected in several way, e.g. by monitoring
social networks or through the so called spontaneous reporting, the main method
pharmacovigilance adopts in order to identify ADRs. The encoding of free-text
ADR descriptions according to MedDRA standard terminology is central for report
analysis. It is a complex work, which has to be manually implemented by the
pharmacovigilance experts. The manual encoding is expensive (in terms of time).
Moreover, a problem about the accuracy of the encoding may occur, since the
number of reports is growing up day by day. In this paper, we propose
MagiCoder, an efficient Natural Language Processing algorithm able to
automatically derive MedDRA terminologies from free-text ADR descriptions.
MagiCoder is part of VigiWork, a web application for online ADR reporting and
analysis. From a practical view-point, MagiCoder radically reduces the revision
time of ADR reports: the pharmacologist has simply to revise and validate the
automatic solution versus the hard task of choosing solutions in the 70k terms
of MedDRA. This improvement of the expert work efficiency has a meaningful
impact on the quality of data analysis. Moreover, our procedure is general
purpose. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language, but
preliminarily analyses show that it is robust to language and dictionary
changes.

dynamics simulations for three model glass-forming liquids, we show that the
$\beta$-relaxation is actually cooperative in nature. Using finite-size scaling
analysis, we extract a growing length-scale associated with $\beta$-relaxation

Remarkably, the temperature dependence of this length scale is found to be the
same as that of the length scale that describes the spatial heterogeneity of

Existence of geodesics in the space of positive Lagrangians is an important
step in a program for proving existence and uniqueness of special Lagrangians.
Moreover, it would imply certain cases of the strong Arnold conjecture from
Hamiltonian dynamics.
  We show the DSL is degenerate elliptic. We introduce a space-time Lagrangian
angle for one-parameter families of graph Lagrangians, and construct its
regularized lift. The superlevel sets of the regularized lift define
subequations for the DSL in the sense of Harvey--Lawson. We extend the
existence theory of Harvey--Lawson for subequations to the setting of domains
with corners, and thus obtain solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the DSL in
all branches. Moreover, we introduce the calibration measure, which plays a
r\^ole similar to that of the Monge--Amp\`ere measure in convex and complex
geometry. The existence of this measure and regularity estimates allow us to
prove that the solutions we obtain in the outer branches of the DSL have a
well-defined length in the space of positive Lagrangians.

Although three stars were tagged with similar elemental abundances ratios, we
find that, statistically, it is not certain that they originate from a

of [Fe/H] ($\sigma_{\rm{[Fe/H]}} = 0.29$) among the 16 stream members. We find
that our stars are $\alpha$ enhanced and that the abundance patterns of the

unstable flows generated in a rotating tank with topographic beta-effect are
presented. We study zonal jets of alternating direction which occur in these
flows. The primary system we model includes lighter fluid in the South and
heavier fluid in the North with resulting slow meridional circulation and fast
mean zonal motion. In a two-layer system the velocity shear between the layers
results in baroclinic instability which equilibrates with time and, due to
interaction with beta-effect generates zonal jets. This system is archetypal
for various geophysical systems including the general circulation and jet
streams in the Earths atmosphere, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current or the
areas in the vicinity of western boundary currents where baroclinic instability
and multiple zonal jets are observed. The gradient of the surface elevation and
the thickness of the upper layer are measured in the experiments using the
Altimetric Imaging Velocimetry and the Optical Thickness Velocimetry techniques
respectively. Barotropic and baroclinic velocity fields are then derived from
the measured quantities. The results demonstrate that the zonal jets are driven
by eddy forcing due to continuously created baroclinic perturbations. The flow
is baroclinic to a significant degree and the jets are surface intensified. The
meridional wavelength of the jets varies linearly with the baroclinic radius of
deformation and is also in a good agreement with a modified Rhines scale. This
suggests a linear dependence of the perturbation velocity in the equilibrated
baroclinically unstable flow on the beta-parameter.

enjoys important integrability properties which manifest themselves by the
existence of infinite hierarchies of conservation laws (both local and
non-local) and the presence associated linear problems. It thus contains many
important known examples of integrable equations, like the sine-Gordon,
Liouville, KdV, mKdV, Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations, and is
also home to many new families of integrable equations. Our paper is concerned
with the question of the local isometric immersion in ${\bf E}^{3}$ of the
pseudospherical surfaces defined by the solutions of equations belonging to the
class of Chern and Tenenblat. In the case of the sine-Gordon equation, it is a
classical result that the second fundamental form of the immersion depends only
on a jet of finite order of the solution of the pde. A natural question is
therefore to know if this remarkable property extends to equations other than
the sine-Gordon equation within the class of differential equations describing
pseudospherical surfaces. In the present paper, we consider third-order
equations of the form $u_{t}-u_{xxt}=\lambda u u_{xxx} + G(u,u_x,u_{xx}),\,
\lambda \in \mathbb{R}, $ which describe pseudospherical surfaces. This class
contains the Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations as special cases. We
show that whenever there exists a local isometric immersion in ${\bf E}^3$ for
which the coefficients of the second fundamental form depend on a jet of finite
order of $u$, then these coefficients are universal in the sense of being
independent on the choice of solution $u$.

aim of determining the chaoticity of this system. We calculate different
independent statistical properties to check their degree of agreement with
random matrix theory (RMT), and analyze if they are consistent with the
possibility of having missing resonances. The analysis of the short-range
fluctuations as a function of the magnetic field points to a steady increase of
chaoticity until $B \sim 30$ G. The repulsion parameter decreases for higher
magnetic fields, an effect that can be interpreted as due to missing
resonances. The analysis of long-range fluctuations allows us to be more
quantitative and estimate a $20-25\%$ fraction of missing levels. Finally, a
study of the distribution of resonance widths provides additional evidence
supporting missing resonances of small width compared with the experimental
magnetic field resolution. We conclude that further measurements with increased
resolution will be necessary to give a final answer to the problem of missing
resonances and the agreement with RMT.

order to study into detail the uncertainties of retrieved parameters. On
Emission Phase Function (EPF) data, we demonstrate that the uncertainties of

this relation is due to the fact that b and c are coupled parameters in the

the Bayesian method is a good tool to test if the sampling geometry is
sufficient to constrain the parameters (single scattering albedo, surface
roughness, b, c, opposition effect). We performed sensitivity tests by
mimicking various surface scattering properties and various single

that is confined to the vortex, so flux is not present both inside and outside.
We construct vortices for which this is not true, where the flux carried by the
vortex also permeates the `bulk' far from the vortex. The idea is to mix the
vortex's internal gauge flux with an external flux using off-diagonal kinetic
mixing. Such `dark' vortices could play a phenomenological role in models with
both cosmic strings and a dark gauge sector. When coupled to gravity they also
provide explicit ultra-violet completions for codimension-two brane-localized
flux, which arises in extra-dimensional models when the same flux that
stabilizes extra-dimensional size is also localized on space-filling branes
situated around the extra dimensions. We derive simple formulae for observables
such as defect angle, tension, localized flux and on-vortex curvature when
coupled to gravity, and show how all of these are insensitive to much of the
microscopic details of the solutions, and are instead largely dictated by
low-energy quantities. We derive the required effective description in terms of
a world-sheet brane action, and derive the matching conditions for its
couplings. We consider the case where the dimensions transverse to the bulk
compactify, and determine how the on- and off-vortex curvatures and other bulk
features depend on the vortex properties. We find that the brane-localized flux
does not gravitate, but just renormalizes the tension in a magnetic-field
independent way. The existence of an explicit UV completion puts the effective
description of these models on a more precise footing, verifying that
brane-localized flux can be consistent with sensible UV physics and resolving
some apparent paradoxes that can arise with a naive (but commonly used)
delta-function treatment of the brane's localization within the bulk.

number of small holes $D_m$'s of maximum radius $a$, $a<<1$, modeled by surface
impedance functions. Precisely, we are in the regime described by the number of
holes of the order $M:=O(a^{\beta-2})$, the minimum distance between the holes
is $d\sim a^t$ and the surface impedance functions of the form $\lambda_m \sim

$\beta, t$ and $\lambda_{m,0}$, we characterize the equivalent medium
generating, approximately, the same scattered waves as the original perforated
acoustic medium. We give an explicit error estimate between the scattered waves
generated by the perforated medium and the equivalent one respectively, as $a
\rightarrow 0$. As applications of these results, we discuss the following
findings:
  1. If we choose negative valued imaginary surface impedance functions,
attached to each surface of the holes, then the equivalent medium behaves as a
passive acoustic medium only if it is an acoustic metamaterial with index of
refraction $\tilde{n}(x)=-n(x),\; x \in \Omega$ and $\tilde{n}(x)=1,\; x \in
\mathbb{R}^3\setminus{\overline{\Omega}}$. This means that, with this process,
we can switch the sign of the index of the refraction from positive to negative
values.
  2. We can choose the surface impedance functions attached to each surface of
the holes so that the equivalent index of refraction $\tilde{n}$ is
$\tilde{n}(x)=1,\; x \in \mathbb{R}^3$. This means that the region $\Omega$
modeled by the original index of refraction $n$ is approximately cloaked.

intensity across a wavelength bin of non-zero size. It is assigned to the
wavelength position at the center of the bin. However, the actual intensity at
that discrete position will be different if the profile is curved, as it
invariably is. Standard fitting routines (spline, Gaussian, etc.) do not
account for this difference, and this can result in significant errors when
making sensitive measurements. Detection of asymmetries in solar coronal
emission lines is one example. Removal of line blends is another. We have
developed an iterative procedure that corrects for this effect. It can be used

Bi-2212 single crystal by performing a fine tuned doping study. We found three
distinct energy scales in A1g, B1g and B2g symmetries which show three distinct
doping dependencies. Above p=0.22 the three energies merge, below p=0.12, the
A1g scale is no more detectable while the B1g and B2g scales become constant in
energy. In between, the A1g and B1g scales increase monotonically with
under-doping while the B2g one exhibits a maximum at p=0.16. The three
superconducting energy scales appear to be an universal feature of hole-doped
cuprates. We propose that the non trivial doping dependence of the three scales
originates from Fermi surface topology changes and reveals competing orders
inside the superconducting dome.

directional probability distributions. To model asymmetrically distributed data
on a three-dimensional sphere, Kent distributions are often used. The moment
estimates of the parameters are typically used in modelling tasks involving
Kent distributions. However, these lack a rigorous statistical treatment. The
focus of the paper is to introduce a Bayesian estimation of the parameters of
the Kent distribution which has not been carried out in the literature, partly
because of its complex mathematical form. We employ the Bayesian
information-theoretic paradigm of Minimum Message Length (MML) to bridge this
gap and derive reliable estimators. The inferred parameters are subsequently
used in mixture modelling of Kent distributions. The problem of inferring the
suitable number of mixture components is also addressed using the MML
criterion. We demonstrate the superior performance of the derived MML-based
parameter estimates against the traditional estimators. We apply the MML
principle to infer mixtures of Kent distributions to model empirical data
corresponding to protein conformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
Kent models to act as improved descriptors of protein structural data as
compared to commonly used von Mises-Fisher distributions.

developed in paper I, is applied to examine the influence of chain stiffness on
the average degree of self-assembly and the basic thermodynamic properties of
linear telechelic polymer melts. Our calculations imply that chain stiffness
promotes self-assembly of linear telechelic polymer melts that assemble on
cooling when either polymer volume fraction $\phi$ or temperature $T$ is high,
but opposes self-assembly when both $\phi$ and $T$ are sufficiently low. This
allows us to identify a boundary line in the $\phi$-$T$ plane that separates
two regions of qualitatively different influence of chain stiffness on
self-assembly. The enthalpy and entropy of self-assembly are usually treated as
adjustable parameters in classical Flory-Huggins type theories for the
equilibrium self-assembly of polymers, but they are demonstrated here to
strongly depend on chain stiffness. Moreover, illustrative calculations for the
dependence of the entropy density of linear telechelic polymer melts on chain

semiconductors for a wide range of applications in electronics and
optoelectronics. Most studies have focused on binary monolayers that share
common properties: direct optical bandgap, spin-orbit (SO) splittings of
hundreds of meV, light-matter interaction dominated by robust excitons and
coupled spin-valley states of electrons. Studies on alloy-based monolayers are
more recent, yet they may not only extend the possibilities for TMDC
applications through specific engineering but also help understanding the
differences between each binary material. Here, we synthesized highly
crystalline Mo$_{(1-x)}$W$_{x}$Se$_2$ to show engineering of the direct optical
bandgap and the SO coupling in ternary alloy monolayers. We investigate the
impact of the tuning of the SO spin splitting on the optical and polarization
properties. We show a non-linear increase of the optically generated valley
polarization as a function of tungsten concentration, where 40% tungsten
incorporation is sufficient to achieve valley polarization as high as in binary
WSe2. We also probe the impact of the tuning of the conduction band SO spin
splitting on the bright versus dark state population i.e. PL emission
intensity. We show that the MoSe2 PL intensity decreases as a function of
temperature by an order of magnitude, whereas for WSe2 we measure surprisingly
an order of magnitude increase over the same temperature range (T=4-300K). The
ternary material shows a trend between these two extreme behaviors. These
results show the strong potential of SO engineering in ternary TMDC alloys for
optoelectronics and applications based on electron spin- and valley-control.

does not depend strongly on electron energy. In the case of gentle evaporation,
lower energy electrons are significantly more efficient at heating the
atmosphere and driving up-flows sooner than higher energy electrons. We also
find that the threshold between explosive and gentle evaporation is not fixed
at a given beam energy flux, but also depends strongly on the electron energy
and duration of heating. Further, at low electron energies, a much weaker beam
flux is required to drive explosive evaporation.

branches $U_i(t), i=1,...,I$ necessary for coping with different types of
risks, which must all be kept above $0$, and b) a central branch (CB) which
bails out the subsidiaries whenever necessary. Ruin occurs when the central
branch is ruined. We find out that with one subsidiary ($I=1$), the finite time
ruin probability of the central branch may be explicitly written out in terms
of the finite time ruin probability of the subsidiary, provided that the CB in
the absence of subsidiary bailouts is a deterministic drift. To study other
problems, like for example the optimization of dividends to the CB with one
subsidiary over a barrier, it is convenient to restrict to the case of
phase-type claims to the subsidiary, and study the Markovian phase process at
the moments when the CB process reaches new minima. The resulting structure is
quite close to that of the phase of a PH/G/1 queue at the moments when it
reaches new minima, and this yields in principle numeric approaches to several
problems, based on the iterative calculation of the Laplace transforms of the
upwards and downwards ladder times (also called excursions, and busy periods).
In this work we propose a different approach of further providing matrix
exponential approximations for the distributions of the ladder times. The
advantage of this approach is that once a SNMAP approximation is obtained, many
similar problems may be solved just by applying the recently developed scale
matrix methodology. A numeric experiment for the CB barrier optimization
problem is provided.

readers to pick the funniest one. We describe an experiment that compares a
dozen automatic methods for selecting the funniest caption. We show that
negative sentiment, human-centeredness, and lexical centrality most strongly
match the funniest captions, followed by positive sentiment. These results are
useful for understanding humor and also in the design of more engaging
conversational agents in text and multimodal (vision+text) systems. As part of
this work, a large set of cartoons and captions is being made available to the

a male taxi driver. Among statistical predictors for retention and in-game high

scientists to provide solutions to research problems. While citizen science
games Foldit, EteRNA and EyeWire have been used successfully to study protein

gamifying optimization problems in quantum physics. We show that human players
are able to find solutions to difficult problems associated with the task of
quantum computing. Players succeed where purely numerical optimization fails,
and analyses of their solutions provide insights into the problem of
optimization of a more profound and general nature. Based on player strategies,
we have thus developed a new, few-parameter heuristic optimization method which
efficiently outperforms the most prominent established numerical methods. The
numerical complexity associated with time-optimal solutions increases for
shorter process durations. To better understand this, we have made a
low-dimensional rendering of the optimization landscape. These studies show why
traditional optimization methods fail near the quantum speed limit, and they
bring promise that combined analyses of optimization landscapes and heuristic

  paper. This part remained in IEEE (resubmission on April 27, 2015). arXiv
  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1506.07820, arXiv:1506.06952",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uninorms with continuous underlying t-norm and t-conorm are discussed and
properties of the set of discontinuity points of such a uninorm are shown. This
set is proved to be a subset of the graph of a special symmetric, surjective,
non-increasing multi-function. A sufficient condition for a uninorm to have
continuous underlying operations is also given.
  Several examples are included.

Through skill and chance, the
script of each game is dynamically written in real time by players acting out
possible trajectories allowed by a sport's rules. By properly characterizing a
given sport's ecology of `game stories', we are able to capture the sport's
capacity for unfolding interesting narratives, in part by contrasting them with
random walks. Here, we explore the game story space afforded by a data set of
1,310 Australian Football League (AFL) score lines. We find that AFL games
exhibit a continuous spectrum of stories rather than distinct clusters. We show
how coarse-graining reveals identifiable motifs ranging from last minute
comeback wins to one-sided blowouts. Through an extensive comparison with
biased random walks, we show that real AFL games deliver a broader array of
motifs than null models, and we provide consequent insights into the narrative
appeal of real games.

space, wireless, optical link. The retro-modulator is made up of a
retro-reflecting cornercube onto which 2 cascaded V-shape smectics liquid
crystal modulators are mounted. The communication link differs with respect to
more conventional optical links in not using amplitude (nor frequency)
modulation, but instead state-of-polarisation (SOP) modulation known as
Polarisation Shift Keying (PolSK). PolSK has the advantage over amplitude
modulation, that it is less sensitive to changes in the visibility of the
atmosphere, and increases inherently the bandwidth of the link. The
implementation of PolSK both in liquid crystal based and in retro-modulated
communication are novelties.
