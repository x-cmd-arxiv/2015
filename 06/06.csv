with an arbitrary number of layers. The model is derived from partially
self-consistent $GW_0$ approach, where the screened Coulomb interaction $W_0$
is calculated within the random phase approximation on the basis of density
functional theory. We thoroughly validate the model by performing a series of
benchmark calculations, and determine the limits of its applicability. The
application of the model to the calculations of electronic and optical
properties of multilayer BP demonstrates good quantitative agreement with
\emph{ab initio} results in a wide energy range. We also show that the proposed
model can be easily extended for the case of external fields, yielding the
results consistent with those obtained from first principles. The model is
expected to be suitable for a variety of realistic problems related to the
electronic properties of multilayer BP including different kinds of disorder,
external fields, and many-body effects.

large-scale overdetermined or underdetermined systems of linear equations. The
computation is performed efficiently and stably based on the modified
alternating least squares (MALS) scheme using low-rank tensor train (TT)
decompositions and tensor network contractions. The formulated large-scale
optimization problem is reduced to sequential smaller-scale problems for which
any standard and stable algorithms can be applied. Regularization technique is
incorporated in order to alleviate ill-posedness and obtain robust low-rank
approximations. Numerical simulation results illustrate that the regularized
pseudoinverses of a wide class of non-square or nonsymmetric matrices admit
good approximate low-rank TT representations. Moreover, we demonstrated that
the computational cost of the proposed method is only logarithmic in the matrix
size given that the TT-ranks of a data matrix and its approximate pseudoinverse
are bounded. It is illustrated that a strongly nonsymmetric
convection-diffusion problem can be efficiently solved by using the

pattern matching. There have been two completely different directions for
supporting efficient subgraph pattern matching. One direction is to develop
specialized RDF query processing engines exploiting the properties of RDF data

searching strategies for navigating in metropolitan maps has been observed for
large, complex metropolitan networks. This evidence suggests the existence of
another limit associated to the cognitive overload and caused by large amounts
of information to process. In this light, we analyzed the world's 15 largest
metropolitan networks and estimated the information limit for determining a

""Dunbar number,"" which represents a limit to the size of an individual's

more than about $250$ connections points to be easily readable. We also show
that including connections with other transportation modes dramatically
increases the information needed to navigate in multilayer transportation
networks: in large cities such as New York, Paris, and Tokyo, more than $80\%$
of trips are above the 8-bit limit. Multimodal transportation systems in large

16-15 with GREAT/SOFIA and analyzed the spatial and velocity structure to
assign the emission to individual heating sources. We measure the optical depth
of the [CII] line and perform radiative transfer computations for all observed
transitions. By comparing the line intensities with the far-infrared continuum
we can assess the total cooling budget and measure the gas heating efficiency.
The main emission of fine structure lines in S 140 stems from a 8.3'' region
close to the infrared source IRS 2 that is not prominent at any other
wavelength. It can be explained by a photon-dominated region (PDR) structure
around the embedded cluster if we assume that the [OI] line intensity is
reduced by a factor seven due to self-absorption. The external cloud interface
forms a second PDR at an inclination of 80-85 degrees illuminated by an UV
field of 60 times the standard interstellar radiation field. The main radiation
source in the cloud, IRS 1, is not prominent at all in the fine structure
lines. We measure line-to-continuum cooling ratios below 10^(-4), i.e. values
lower than in any other Galactic source, rather matching the far-IR line
deficit seen in ULIRGs. In particular the low intensity of the [CII] line can
only be modeled by an extreme excitation gradient in the gas around IRS 1. We
found no explanation why IRS 1 shows no associated fine-structure line peak,
while IRS 2 does. The inner part of S 140 mimics the far-IR line deficit in
ULIRGs thereby providing a template that may lead to a future model.

significant spectral variation. A model combining a multi-temperature thermal

good description of the NuSTAR spectrum. Although relativistic broadening of
the iron line is observed, it is not possible to constrain the black hole spin
with these data. The variability of the power-law component, which can also be

change during the flare, suggesting that changes in the corona (or possibly
continued jet activity) are the likely cause of the flare.

"1506.02002","Jeremy Berquist","Jeremy Berquist","Singularities on Demi-Normal Varieties",,,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The birational classification of varieties inevitably leads to the study of
singularities. The types of singularities that occur in this context have been
studied by Mori, Koll\'ar, Reid, and others, beginning in the 1980s with the
introduction of the minimal model program. Normal singularities that are
terminal, canonical, log terminal, and log canonical, and their non-normal
counterparts, are typically studied using a resolution of singularities (or a
semiresolution) and finding numerical conditions that relate the canonical
class of the variety to that of its resolution. In order to do this, it has
been assumed that a variety $X$ has a $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class:
some multiple $mK_X$ of the canonical class is Cartier. In particular, this
divisor can be pulled back under a resolution $f: Y \rightarrow X$ by pulling
back its local sections. Then one has a relation $K_Y \sim \frac{1}{m}f^*(mK_X)
+ \sum a_iE_i$. It is then the coefficients of the exceptional divisors $E_i$
that determine the type of singularities that belong to $X$. It might be asked
whether this $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier hypothesis is necessary in studying
singularities in birational classification. In \cite{dFH09}, de Fernex and
Hacon construct a boundary divisor $\Delta$ for arbitrary normal varieties, the
resulting divisor $K_X + \Delta$ being $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier even though $K_X$
itself is not. This they call (for reasons that will be made clear) an
$m$-compatible boundary for $X$, and they proceed to show that the
singularities defined in terms of the pair $(X, \Delta)$ are none other than
the singularities just described, when $K_X$ happens to be
$\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier. In the present paper, we extend the results of
\cite{dFH09} still further, to include demi-normal varieties without a
$\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class.

(D$_2$O) of 6 K as compared to the experimental value of 4 K. More importantly,
we are able to explain the origin of the isotope effect on the much debated
large temperature difference observed in the phase transition. The source of
the difference is directly linked to the physics behind the anomalous isotope
effect on the volume of hexagonal ice that was recently explained in [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 108, 193003 (2012)]. These results indicate that the same physics
might be behind the isotope effects in transition temperatures between other

around stars distributed in the disk of the galaxy towards the bulge. However,
the alignment of two stars that led to the discovery is unique over the
timescale of a human life and cannot be re-observed. Moreover, the target host
is often very faint and located in a crowded region. These difficulties hamper
and often make impossible the follow-up of the target and study of its possible
companions. Gould et al. (2013) predicted the radial-velocity curve of a binary

obtained ten radial velocities on the putative V=18 lens with a dispersion of
~100 m/s, spread over one year. Our measurements do not confirm the
microlensing prediction for this binary system. The most likely scenario is
that the assumed V=18 mag lens is actually a blend and not the primary lens

respond to ads. So publishers estimate ad response rates and multiply by
advertiser bids to estimate expected revenue for showing ads. Since these
estimates may be inaccurate, the publisher risks not selecting the ad for each
ad call that would maximize revenue. The variance of revenue can be decomposed
into two components -- variance due to `uncertainty' because the true response
rate is unknown, and variance due to `randomness' because realized response
statistics fluctuate around the true response rate. Over a sequence of many ad
calls, the variance due to randomness nearly vanishes due to the law of large
numbers. However, the variance due to uncertainty doesn't diminish.
  We introduce a technique for ad selection that augments existing estimation
and explore-exploit methods. The technique uses methods from portfolio

by an exogenous stochastic energy harvesting process $E_t$, such that $0\leq
E_t\leq\bar{E}$, which can be stored in a battery of finite size $\bar{B}$. We
provide a simple and insightful formula for the approximate capacity of this
channel with bounded guarantee on the approximation gap independent of system
parameters. This approximate characterization of the capacity identifies two
qualitatively different operating regimes for this channel: in the large
battery regime, when $\bar{B}\geq \bar{E}$, the capacity is approximately equal
to that of an AWGN channel with an average power constraint equal to the
average energy harvesting rate, i.e. it depends only on the mean of $E_t$ and
is (almost) independent of the distribution of $E_t$ and the exact value of
$\bar{B}$. In particular, this suggests that a battery size
$\bar{B}\approx\bar{E}$ is approximately sufficient to extract the infinite
battery capacity of the system. In the small battery regime, when
$\bar{B}<\bar{E}$, we clarify the dependence of the capacity on the
distribution of $E_t$ and the value of $\bar{B}$. There are three steps to
proving this result which can be of interest in their own right: 1) we
characterize the capacity of this channel as an $n$-letter mutual information
rate under various assumptions on the availability of energy arrival
information; 2) we characterize the approximately optimal online power control
policy that maximizes the long-term average throughput of the system; 3) we
show that the information-theoretic capacity of this channel is equal, within a
constant gap, to its long-term average throughput. This last result provides a

reports it to a utility provider (UP). Despite the advantages of SMs, their use
leads to serious concerns about consumer privacy. In this paper, SM privacy is
studied by considering the presence of an energy harvesting device (EHD) as a
means of masking the user's input load. The user can satisfy part or all of
his/her energy needs from the EHD, and hence, less information can be leaked to
the UP via the SM. The EHD is typically equipped with a rechargeable energy
storage device, i.e., a battery, whose instantaneous energy content limits the
user's capability in covering his/her energy usage. Privacy is measured by the
information leaked about the user's real energy consumption when the UP
observes the energy requested from the grid, which the SM reads and reports to
the UP. The minimum information leakage rate is characterized as a computable
information theoretic single-letter expression when the EHD battery capacity is
either infinite or zero. Numerical results are presented for a discrete binary

two-dimensional strongly interacting topological phases. In this manuscript we
extend this approach to three-dimensions, and construct a model for a
fractional strong topological insulator. This topologically ordered phase has
an exotic gapless state on the surface, called a fractional Dirac liquid, which
cannot be described by the Dirac theory of free fermions. Like in
non-interacting strong topological insulators, the surface is protected by the
presence of time-reversal symmetry and charge conservation. We show that upon
breaking these symmetries, the gapped fractional Dirac liquid presents unique
features. In particular, the gapped phase that results from breaking
time-reversal symmetry has a halved fractional Hall conductance of the form
$\sigma_{xy}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2}}{mh}$ if the filling is $\nu=1/m$. On the
other hand, if the surface is gapped by proximity coupling to an $s$-wave
superconductor, we end up with an exotic topological superconductor. To reveal
the topological nature of this superconducting phase, we partition the surface
into two regions: one with broken time-reversal symmetry and another coupled to
a superconductor. We find a fractional Majorana mode, which cannot be described
by a free Majorana theory, on the boundary between the two regions. The density
of states associated with tunneling into this one-dimensional channel is
proportional to $\omega^{m-1}$, in analogy to the edge of the corresponding
Laughlin state.

of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays. We focus on particle acceleration and
magnetic field generation, and describe the recent progress in the field driven
by theory advances and by the rapid development of particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations. In weakly magnetized or quasi parallel-shocks (where the magnetic
field is nearly aligned with the flow), particle acceleration is efficient. The
accelerated particles stream ahead of the shock, where they generate strong
magnetic waves which in turn scatter the particles back and forth across the
shock, mediating their acceleration. In contrast, in strongly magnetized
quasi-perpendicular shocks, the efficiencies of both particle acceleration and
magnetic field generation are suppressed. Particle acceleration, when
efficient, modifies the turbulence around the shock on a long time scale, and
the accelerated particles have a characteristic energy spectral index of ~ 2.2
in the ultra-relativistic limit. We discuss how this novel understanding of
particle acceleration and magnetic field generation in relativistic shocks can
be applied to high-energy astrophysical phenomena, with an emphasis on PWNe and

governed by star formation and feedback to gain insight from the observed
galaxy stellar mass-metallicity relations over a large range of stellar masses
and redshifts. The model reveals the following implications of star formation
and feedback processes in galaxy formation. First, the observed metallicity
relations provide a stringent upper limit for the averaged outflow mass-loading
factors of local galaxies, which is ~20 for M_*~10^9Msun galaxies and
monotonically decreases to ~1 for M_*~10^{11}Msun galaxies. Second, the
inferred upper-limit for the outflow mass-loading factor sensitively depends on
whether the outflow is metal-enriched with respect to the ISM metallicity. If
half of the metals ejected from SNe leave the galaxy in metal-enriched winds,
the outflow mass-loading factor for galaxies at any mass can barely be higher
than ~10, which puts strong constraints on galaxy formation models. Third, the
relatively lower stellar-phase to gas-phase metallicity ratio for lower-mass
galaxies indicate that low-mass galaxies are still rapidly enriching their
metallicities in recent times, while high-mass galaxies are more settled, which
seems to show a downsizing effect in the metallicity evolution of galaxies. The
analysis presented in the paper demonstrates the importance of accurate
measurements of galaxy metallicities and the cold gas fraction of galaxies at
different redshifts for constraining star formation and feedback processes, and
demonstrates the power of these relations in constraining the physics of galaxy
formation.

measurement of the cosmological mass density of neutral hydrogen, $\Omega_{\rm
HI}$. At such high redshift important systematic uncertainties in the
identification of DLAs are produced by strong intergalactic medium absorption
and QSO continuum placement. These can cause spurious DLA detections, result in
real DLAs being missed, or bias the inferred DLA column density distribution.
We correct for these effects using a combination of mock and higher-resolution
spectra, and show that for the GGG DLA sample the uncertainties introduced are
smaller than the statistical errors on $\Omega_{\rm HI}$. We find $\Omega_{\rm
HI}=0.98^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\times10^{-3}$ at $\langle z\rangle=4.9$, assuming a
20% contribution from lower column density systems below the DLA threshold. By
comparing to literature measurements at lower redshifts, we show that
$\Omega_{\rm HI}$ can be described by the functional form $\Omega_{\rm

orbiting binaries with periods shorter than seven days. In triple systems,
secular Kozai-Lidov cycles and tidal friction (KLCTF) have been shown to reduce
the inner orbital period from $\sim 10^4$ to a few days. Indeed, the majority
of short-period binaries are observed to possess a third stellar companion.
Using secular evolution analysis and population synthesis, we show that KLCTF
makes it unlikely for circumbinary transiting planets to exist around
short-period binaries. We find the following outcomes. (1) Sufficiently massive
planets in tight and/or coplanar orbits around the inner binary can quench the
KL evolution because they induce precession in the inner binary. The KLCTF
process does not take place, preventing the formation of a short-period binary.
(2) Secular evolution is not quenched and it drives the planetary orbit into a
high eccentricity, giving rise to an unstable configuration, in which the
planet is most likely ejected from the system. (3) Secular evolution is not
quenched but the planet survives the KLCTF evolution. Its orbit is likely to be
much wider than the currently observed inner binary orbit, and is likely to be
eccentric and inclined with respect to the inner binary. These outcomes lead to
two main conclusions: (1) it is unlikely to find a massive planet on a tight
and coplanar orbit around a short-period binary, and (2) the properties of
circumbinary planets in short-period binaries are constrained by secular
evolution.

stars, is seen among stars of the combined samples. Because this specific Ba
pattern is present in $\omega$ Centauri irrespective of stellar generation,
this would rule out the possibility that our entire sample might be composed of
only first generation stars from the cluster. Finally, for the stars of the

effective radius is observed with increasing galactocentric distance, except
perhaps for clusters younger than 100 Myr. We find a shallow correlation
between effective radius and mass for the full cluster sample, but a stronger
correlation is present for clusters 200-300 Myr in age. Finally, the majority
of the clusters are best fit by an EFF model with index $\eta\leq3.0$. There is
no strong evidence for change in $\eta$ with cluster age, mass, or

tenths of an AU (like the majority of the {\it Kepler} planets), the atmosphere
it was able to accumulate while embedded in the proto-planetary disk may not
survive unscathed after the disk disperses. This gas envelope, if more massive
than a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\oplus$), has a cooling
time that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the
disk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original
size, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be
losing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum
radiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon
after the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation
becomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the
envelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere
rapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$
Bondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a
million years after the disk disperses, we find a planet that has only about
ten percent of its original envelope, and a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much
longer than its actual age. We suggest that this ""boil-off"" process may be
partially responsible for the lack of planets above a radius of $2.5 R_\oplus$
in the {\it Kepler} data, provided planet formation results in initial envelope
masses of tens of percent.

the growth of the central massive black holes (MBHs) and their host galaxies is
fundamental for our understanding of the evolution of galaxies and the
processes that have shaped their central structures. We present the results of
a semi-analytical galaxy formation model that follows the evolution of dark
matter halos along merger trees, as well as that of the baryonic components.
This model allows us to study the evolution of NSCs in a cosmological context,
by taking into account the growth of NSCs due to both dynamical friction-driven
migration of stellar clusters and star formation triggered by infalling gas,
while also accounting for dynamical heating from (binary) MBHs. We find that
in-situ star formation contributes a significant fraction (up to ~80%) of the
total mass of NSCs in our model. Both NSC growth through in-situ star formation
and through star cluster migration are found to generate NSC -- host galaxy
scaling correlations that are shallower than the same correlations for MBHs. We
explore the role of galaxy mergers on the evolution of NSCs, and show that
observational data on NSC -- host galaxy scaling relations provide evidence of
partial erosion of NSCs by MBH binaries in luminous galaxies. We show that this
observational feature is reproduced by our models, and we make predictions
about the NSC and MBH occupation fraction in galaxies. We conclude by
discussing several implications for theories of NSC formation.

find 1763 galaxies that are brighter than $R = 22.9$ in the large-scale cluster

they evolve to $z = 0$ using spherical infall models and find that $\sim30\%$

of galaxies that have fallen into the clusters since $z \sim 0.6$ to those that
were already in the core at that redshift is typically between $\sim0.3$ and
$1.5$. This wide range of ratios is due to intrinsic scatter and is not a
function of velocity dispersion, so a variety of infall histories is to be
expected for clusters with current velocity dispersions of $300

0.6$ clusters, we find a larger red fraction of galaxies than in the field and
greater clustering among red galaxies than blue. We interpret these findings as

their star formation rates affected prior to their aggregation into massive

statistically model the MSA incorporating both short-range and long-range
correlations as well as insertions, I have derived a lattice gas model of the
MSA based on the principle of maximum entropy. The partition function, obtained
by the transfer matrix method with a mean-field approximation, accounts for all
possible alignments with all possible sequences. The model parameters for
short-range and long-range interactions were determined by a self-consistent
condition and by a Gaussian approximation, respectively. Using this model with
and without long-range interactions, I analyzed the globin and V-set domains by
increasing the ""temperature"" and by ""mutating"" a site. The correlations between
residue conservation and various measures of the system's stability indicate
that the long-range interactions make the conservation pattern more specific to
the structure, and increasingly stabilize better conserved residues.

look at each gene in the data in isolation from others. They measure the
contribution of a particular gene to the classification without considering the
presence of the other genes. In contrast, multivariate methods measure the
relative contribution of a gene to the classification by taking the other genes
in the data into consideration. Multivariate methods select fewer genes in
general. However, the selection process of multivariate methods may be
sensitive to the presence of irrelevant genes, noises in the expression and
outliers in the training data. At the same time, the computational cost of
multivariate methods is high. To overcome the disadvantages of the two types of
approaches, we propose a hybrid method to obtain gene sets that are small and
highly discriminative.
  We devise our hybrid method from the univariate Maximum Likelihood method

phenomenology based on coexisting competing orders with superconductivity in

consistent account for a wide range of experimental findings. In the case of
iron-based superconductors, studies of the low-energy excitations reveal
interesting similarities and differences when compared with cuprate

an insulating parent state, the ferrous superconductors are multi-band
materials with a semi-metallic parent state and exhibit two-gap
superconductivity when doped. On the other hand, both systems exhibit strong
antiferromagnetic correlation and Fermi-surface distortion, leading to
unconventional pairing symmetries with sign-changing order parameters on
different parts of the Fermi surface. These findings suggest that the pairing
potentials in both the cuprate and the ferrous superconductors are generally
repulsive, thus favor a pairing mechanism that is electronically driven and a
pairing strength that is closely related to the electronic correlation. The

can be discovered, and their time delays and image positions can in principle
be measured. Using an elliptical power-law potential, we show that combinations
of image positions and time delays for quadruple lenses yield simple analytical
expressions that are connected with observable quantities. These relations can
be used to obtain the approximate axis ratio q, the Einstein radius and the
slope. We apply this method to RX J1131-1231, and show that our analytical
results match the full numerical determinations approximately. Our approach can
quickly determine rough values of lens parameters, which can then be used as
initial guesses for further refinement through numerical modelling and may be
useful for automated lens search in large surveys.

secret data is embedded in images to hide its existence while getting the
minimum possible statistical detectability. This paper proposes a novel magic
least significant bit substitution method (M-LSB-SM) for RGB images. The
proposed method is based on the achromatic component (I-plane) of the
hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color model and multi-level encryption (MLE) in
the spatial domain. The input image is transposed and converted into an HSI
color space. The I-plane is divided into four sub-images of equal size,
rotating each sub-image with a different angle using a secret key. The secret
information is divided into four blocks, which are then encrypted using an MLE
algorithm (MLEA). Each sub-block of the message is embedded into one of the
rotated sub-images based on a specific pattern using magic LSB substitution.
Experimental results validate that the proposed method not only enhances the
visual quality of stego images but also provides good imperceptibility and
multiple security levels as compared to several existing prominent methods.

contains a long-term power-law decay modulated by short-term oscillations. For

reproduce its $\ddot\nu$ variation. We show that the ""averaged"" $n$ is

abruptly as the time span increases, due to the ""averaging"" effect. The
simulated timing residuals agree with the main features of the reported data.
Our model predicts that the averaged $\ddot\nu$ of PSR B0329+54 will start to
decrease rapidly with newer data beyond those used in Hobbs et al.. We further
perform Monte Carlo simulations for the distribution of the reported data in
$|\ddot\nu|$ and $|n|$ versus characteristic age $\tau_{\rm c}$ diagrams. It is
found that the magnetic field oscillation model with decay index $\alpha=0$ can
reproduce the distributions quite well. Compared with magnetic field decay due
to the ambipolar diffusion ($\alpha=0.5$) and the Hall cascade ($\alpha=1.0$),
the model with no long term decay ($\alpha=0$) is clearly preferred for old

otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it
is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient

the number of classes, in contrast to the network output for general CNN
potential functions in CRFs, which is exponential in the order of the
potentials. Hence CNN message learning has fewer network parameters and is more
scalable for cases that a large number of classes are involved. We apply our
method to semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We
achieve an intersection-over-union score of 73.4 on its test set, which is the

processes using e.g., the Bellman-Harris equation, do not resolve a
population's age-structure and are unable to quantify population-size
dependencies. Conversely, current theories that include size-dependent
population dynamics (e.g., mathematical models that include carrying capacity

age-dependent birth and death rates. In this paper, we present a systematic
derivation of a new fully stochastic kinetic theory for interacting

functions, we derive a hierarchy of kinetic equations for the stochastic
evolution of an ageing population undergoing birth and death. We show that the
fully stochastic age-dependent birth-death process precludes factorization of
the corresponding probability densities, which then must be solved by using a
BBGKY-like hierarchy. However, explicit solutions are derived in two simple

generalize both deterministic models and existing master equation approaches by
providing an intuitive and efficient way to simultaneously model age- and

we find that the difference of the band structure comes mainly from the
strength of dimerization. To compare the strength of the electron correlation
having roots in the band structure, we calculate the physical properties
originated from the effect of the electron correlation such as the spin
susceptibility applying two particle self-consistent (TPSC) method. We find
that the maximum value of the spin susceptibility of the I$_{3}$ salt is larger

within the model of the I$_{3}$ salt, the spin susceptibility takes almost the
same value as that of the SbF$_6$ salt for the same magnitude of the

and these modifications may influence the experimental observables produced in
heavy ion collision experiments. The results of present investigations of
in-medium properties of vector and axial-vector mesons at finite density of
strange hadronic medium may be helpful for understanding the experimental data
from heavy-ion collision experiments in-particular for the Compressed Baryonic

promote learning multiple tasks. Since deep features eventually transition from

paper presents Multilinear Relationship Networks (MRN) that discover the task
relationships based on novel tensor normal priors over parameter tensors of
multiple task-specific layers in deep convolutional networks. By jointly
learning transferable features and multilinear relationships of tasks and

that MRN yields state-of-the-art results on three multi-task learning datasets.

Local Group carried out in a cosmological context. We use the ErisDARK
simulation of a MW-sized galaxy to identify some of the most massive subhalos
($M_{vir} > 10^8 M_{\odot}$) that fall into the main host before $z=2$.
Subhalos are replaced before infall with high-resolution models of dwarf
galaxies comprising a faint stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo. The
set of models contains cuspy halos as well as halos with ""cored"" profiles (with
asymptotic inner slope $\gamma = 0.6$). The simulations are then run to $z=0$
with as many as 54 million particles and resolution as small as $\sim 4$ pc
using the N-Body code ChaNGa. The stellar components of all satellites are
significantly affected by tidal stirring, losing stellar mass and undergoing a
morphological transformation towards a pressure supported spheroidal system.
However, while some remnants with cuspy halos maintain significant rotational
flattening and disk-like features, all the shallow halo models achieve
$v/\sigma < 0.5$ and round shapes typical of dSph satellites of the MW and M31.
Mass loss is also enhanced in the latter, and remnants can reach luminosities
and velocity dispersions as low as those of Ultra Faint Dwarfs (UFDs). We argue
that cuspy progenitors must be the exception rather than the rule among
satellites of the MW since all the MW and M31 satellites in the luminosity
range of our remnants are dSphs, a result matched only in the simulation with
""cored"" models.

theoretically the influence of slip boundary conditions on the hydrodynamic
stability of the interface between two immiscible viscous layers subjected to
simple shear flow. It is found that the growth rate of long-wave disturbances
is fairly sensitive to the slip at the interface between layers as well as at
the external boundary. These phenomena are shown to give different
contributions to the stability of shear flow depending on viscosity, thickness,
and density ratios of the layers. Particularly, the interfacial slip can
increase the perturbation growth rate and lead to unstable flow. An important
consequence of this effect is the violation of stability for sheared layers
with equal viscosities and densities in a broad range of thickness ratios. The
conditions of long-wave propagation are analyzed as well, showing a strong
dependence on the type of boundary conditions.

gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information

problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either
computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the
properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and

want to exchange messages via an intermediate ""honest-but-curious"" relay node.
There is no direct link between the users, all communication must take place
via the relay node. The links between the user nodes and the relay are wireless
links with Gaussian noise. It is required that the users' messages be kept
secure from the relay. In prior work, we proposed coding schemes based on
nested lattices for this problem, assuming that the channel gains from the two
user nodes to the relay are identical. We also analyzed the power-rate tradeoff
for secure and reliable message exchange using our coding schemes. In this
paper, we extend our prior work to the case when the channel gains are not
necessarily identical, and are known to the relay node but perhaps not to the
users. We show that using our scheme, perfect secrecy can be obtained only for
certain values of the channel gains, and analyze the power-rate tradeoff in
these cases. We also make similar observations for our strongly-secure scheme.

transmission bit-budget. To recover signals from underdetermined, quantized
measurements, we develop a Bayesian De-quantization algorithm. It can exploit
both the model of quantization errors and the correlated structure of
physiological signals to improve the quality of recovery. The proposed data
compressor and the recovery algorithm are validated on a dataset recorded on 12
subjects during fast running. Experiment results showed that an averaged 2.596
beat per minute (BPM) estimation error was achieved by jointly using compressed
sensing with 50% compression ratio and a 2-bit quantizer. The results imply
that we can effectively transmit n bits instead of n samples, which is a

constraints. This generalizes the problem of learning to predict the purchasing
behavior of a rational agent who has an unknown objective function, that has
been studied under the name ""Learning from Revealed Preferences"". We give
mistake bound learning algorithms in two settings: in the first, the objective
of the LP is known to the learner but there is an arbitrary, fixed set of
constraints which are unknown. Each example is defined by an additional known
constraint and the goal of the learner is to predict the optimal solution of
the LP given the union of the known and unknown constraints. This models the
problem of predicting the behavior of a rational agent whose goals are known,
but whose resources are unknown. In the second setting, the objective of the LP
is unknown, and changing in a controlled way. The constraints of the LP may
also change every day, but are known. An example is given by a set of
constraints and partial information about the objective, and the task of the
learner is again to predict the optimal solution of the partially known LP.

  Molecule Junctions","8 pages, 6 figures. Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. Applied",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It was recently suggested that molecular junctions would be excellent
elements for efficient and high-power thermoelectric energy conversion devices.
However, experimental measurements of thermoelectric conversion in molecular
junctions have indicated rather poor efficiency, raising the question of
whether it is indeed possible to design a setup for molecular junctions that
will exhibit enhanced thermoelectric performance. Here we suggest that hybrid
single-molecule nanoparticle junctions can serve as efficient thermoelectric
converters. The introduction of a semiconducting nanoparticle introduces new
tuning capabilities, which are absent in conventional metal-molecule-metal
junctions. Using a generic model for the molecule and nanoparticle with
realistic parameters, we demonstrate that the thermopower can be of the order
of hundreds of microvolts per degree Kelvin, and that the thermoelectric figure
of merit can reach values close to one, an improvement of four orders of
magnitude improvement over existing measurements. This favorable performance
persists over a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters, and is robust
against disorder (in the form of surface-attached molecules) and against
electron decoherence at the nanoparticle molecule interface.

  tomography of the finger",,,"10.1177/0161734615589288",,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Photoacoustic imaging of interphalangeal peripheral joints is of interest in
the context of using the synovial membrane as a surrogate marker of rheumatoid
arthritis. Previous work has shown that ultrasound produced by absorption of
light at the epidermis reflects on the bone surfaces within the finger. When
the reflected signals are backprojected in the region of interest, artifacts
are produced, confounding interpretation of the images. In this work, we
present an approach where the photoacoustic signals known to originate from the
epidermis, are treated as virtual ultrasound transmitters, and a separate
reconstruction is performed as in ultrasound reflection imaging. This allows us
to identify the bone surfaces. Further, the identification of the joint space
is important as this provides a landmark to localize a region-of-interest in
seeking the inflamed synovial membrane. The ability to delineate bone surfaces
allows us not only to identify the artifacts, but also to identify the
interphalangeal joint space without recourse to new US hardware or a new
measurement. We test the approach on phantoms and on a healthy human finger.

  divergences","Working paper. It only lacks some revisions before submitting",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this paper is to study different estimation procedures based on
$\varphi-$divergences. The dual representation of $\varphi-$divergences based
on the Fenchel-Legendre duality is the main interest of this study. It provides
a way to estimate $\varphi-$divergences by a simple plug-in of the empirical
distribution without any smoothing technique. Resulting estimators are
thoroughly studied theoretically and with simulations showing that the so
called minimum $\varphi-$divergence estimator (MD$\varphi$DE) is generally non
robust and behaves similarly to the maximum likelihood estimator. We give some
arguments supporting the non robustness property, and give insights on how to
modify the classical approach. An alternative class of $\varphi-$divergences
robust estimators based on the dual representation is presented. We study
consistency and robustness properties from an influence function point of view
of the new estimators. In a second part, we invoke the Basu-Lindsay approach
for approximating $\varphi-$divergences and provide a comparison between these
approaches. The so called dual $\varphi-$divergence is also discussed and
compared to our new estimator. A full simulation study of all these approaches
is given in order to compare efficiency and robustness of all mentioned
estimators against the so-called minimum density power divergence, showing
encouraging results in favor of our new class of minimum dual
$\varphi-$divergences.

limit of a generalized Dirac Hamiltonian, lending an intuitive physical
interpretation to the effective operators within Schr\""{o}dinger--Pauli theory.
We here discuss the opposite, ultrarelativistic limit which requires the use of
a fundamentally different expansion where the leading kinetic term in the Dirac
equation is perturbed by the mass of the particle and other interaction
(potential) terms, rather than vice versa. The ultrarelativistic decoupling
transformation is applied to free Dirac particles (in the Weyl basis) and to
high-energy tachyons, which are faster-than-light particles described by a
fully Lorentz-covariant equation. The effective gravitational interactions are
found. For tachyons, the dominant gravitational interaction term in the
high-energy limit is shown to be attractive, and equal to the leading term for
subluminal Dirac particles (tardyons) in the high-energy limit.
