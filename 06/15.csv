reduction of string theory, and in the theories emerging as byproducts, we
study the hyper-complex formulation of Abelian gauge field theories, by
incorporating a new complex unit to the usual complex one. The hypercomplex
version of the traditional Mexican hat potential associated with the $U(1)$
gauge field theory, corresponds to a {\it hybrid} potential with two real
components, and with $U(1)\times SO(1,1)$ as symmetry group. Each component
corresponds to a deformation of the hat potential, with the appearance of a new
degenerate vacuum. Hypercomplex electrodynamics will show novel properties,
such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios with running masses for the
vectorial and scalar Higgs fields, and the Aharonov-Bohm type strings defects
as exact solutions; these topological defects may be detected only by quantum
interference of charged particles through gauge invariant loop integrals. In a
particular limit, the {\it hyperbolic} electrodynamics does not admit
topological defects associated with continuous symmetries

masks the homogeneous spectral lineshape and the underlying coherent dynamics.
A variety of techniques including four-wave mixing and spectral hole-burning
are used in optical spectroscopy while in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spin-echo is the most common way to counteract inhomogeneity. However, the
high-power pulses used in spin-echo and other sequences often create spurious
dynamics obscuring the subtle spin correlations that play a crucial role in
quantum information applications. Here we develop NMR techniques that allow the
correlation times of the fluctuations in a nuclear spin bath of individual
quantum dots to be probed. This is achieved with the use of frequency comb
excitation which allows the homogeneous NMR lineshapes to be measured avoiding
high-power pulses. We find nuclear spin correlation times exceeding 1 s in
self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots - four orders of magnitude longer than in
strain-free III-V semiconductors. The observed freezing of the nuclear spin
fluctuations opens the way for the design of quantum dot spin qubits with a
well-understood, highly stable nuclear spin bath.

Chaum's work on code voting assumed voting codes are physically delivered to

This is not necessarily a valid assumption to make - especially if the mail
system cannot be trusted. When conspiring with the recipient of the cast
ballots, privacy is broken.
  It is clear to the public that when it comes to privacy, computers and
""secure"" communication over the Internet cannot fully be trusted. This
emphasizes the importance of using: (1) Unconditional security for secure
network communication. (2) Reduce reliance on untrusted computers.
  In this paper we explore how to remove the mail system trust assumption in
code voting. We use PSMT protocols (SCN 2012) where with the help of visual
aids, humans can carry out $\mod 10$ addition correctly with a 99\% degree of
accuracy. We introduce an unconditionally secure MIX based on the combinatorics

  \item The end step of the protocol can be handled by a human to evade the

including optical quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and distributed
quantum networks. Polarization-encoded photons at telecommunication wavelengths
provide a compelling platform for practical realization of these technologies.
However, despite important success towards building elementary components
compatible with this platform, including sources of entangled photons,
efficient single photon detectors, and on-chip quantum circuits, a missing
element has been atomic quantum memory that directly allows for reversible
mapping of quantum states encoded in the polarization degree of a
telecom-wavelength photon. Here we demonstrate the quantum storage and
retrieval of polarization states of heralded single-photons at
telecom-wavelength by implementing the atomic frequency comb protocol in an
ensemble of erbium atoms doped into an optical fiber. Despite remaining
limitations in our proof-of-principle demonstration such as small storage
efficiency and storage time, our broadband light-matter interface reveals the
potential for use in future quantum information processing.

interior of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes. The source term is taken
to be the stress-energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar field with
arbitrary curvature coupling calculated within the framework of the
Schwinger-DeWitt approximation. It is shown that for the minimal coupling the
quantum effects tend to isotropize the interior of the black hole (which can be
interpreted as an anisotropic collapsing universe) for D=4 and 5, whereas for
D=6 and 7 the spacetime becomes more anisotropic. Similar behavior is observed
for the conformal coupling with the reservation that for D=5 isotropization of
the spacetime occurs during (approximately) the first 1/3 of the lifetime of
the interior universe. On the other hand, we find that regardless of the
dimension, the quantum perturbations initially strengthen the grow of curvature
and its later behavior depends on the dimension and the coupling. It is shown
that the Karlhede's scalar can still be used as a useful device for locating
the horizon of the quantum-corrected black hole, as expected.

saline aqquifer in the presence of a background hydrological flow. In
steady-state, the distribution of CO$_2$ in the groundwater upstream of the
aquifer involves a balance between three competing effects: (i) the
buoyancy-driven flow of CO$_2$ saturated water; (ii) the diffusion of CO$_2$
from saturated to under-saturated water; and (iii) the advection associated
with the oncoming background flow. This leads to three limiting regimes. In the
limit of very slow diffusion, a nearly static intrusion of dense fluid may
extend a finite distance upstream, balanced by the pressure gradient associated
with the oncoming background flow. In the limit of fast diffusion relative to
the flow, a gradient zone may become established in which the along aquifer
diffusive flux balances the advection associated with the background flow.
However, if the buoyancy-driven flow speed exceeds the background hydrological
flow speed, then a third, intermediate regime may become established. In this
regime, a convective recirculation develops upstream of the anticline involving
the vertical diffusion of CO$_2$ from an upstream propagating flow of dense
CO$_2$ saturated water into the downstream propagating flow of CO$_2$
unsaturated water. For each limiting case, we find analytical solutions for the
distribution of CO$_2$ upstream of the anticline, and test our analysis with
full numerical simulations. A key result is that, although there may be very
different controls on the distribution and extent of CO$_2$ bearing water
upstream of the anticline, in each case the dissolution rate is given by the
product of the background volume flux and the difference in concentration
between the CO$_2$ saturated water and the original aquifer water upstream.

negative regulators: TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, or DEPTOR, induces polyploidy in a
rapamycin-sensitive manner. mTORC1 hyperactivation-mediated polyploidization
occurs by a prolonged, but ultimately failed attempt at abcission followed by
re-fusion. Similar to the effects of ROCK2 overexpression, these mTORC1-driven
aberrant cytokinesis events are accompanied by increased Rho-GTP loading,
extensive plasma membrane blebbing, and increased actin-myosin contractility,
all of which can be rescued by either mTORC1 or ROCK inhibition. These results
provide evidence for the existence of a novel mTORC1-Rho-ROCK pathway during
cytokinesis and suggest that mTORC1 might play a critical role in setting the

Therefore, this paper presents an optimal framework for residential load

framework, RLAs are able to realize the DRR for LSEs to generate optimal
control strategies over residential appliances quickly and efficiently. To
residents, the framework is designed with probabilistic model of

To LSEs, the framework helps minimize the total reward costs of performing

Previous studies
revealed that a preference toward similar appearance promotes cooperation, a
phenomenon called tag-mediated cooperation or communitarian cooperation. This
effect is enhanced when a spatial structure is incorporated, because space
allows agents sharing an identical tag to regroup to form locally cooperative
clusters. In spatially distributed settings, one can also consider migration of
organisms, which has a potential to further promote evolution of cooperation by
facilitating spatial clustering. However, it has not yet been considered in
spatial tag-mediated cooperation models. Here we show, using computer
simulations of a spatial model of evolutionary games with organismal migration,
that tag-based segregation and homophilic cooperation arise for a wide range of
parameters. In the meantime, our results also show another evolutionarily
stable outcome, where a high level of heterophilic cooperation is maintained in
spatially well-mixed patterns. We found that these two different forms of
tag-mediated cooperation appear alternately as the parameter for temptation to
defect is increased.

conclude that agnostic analysis of a strong signal (such as Generation-2 would
see if cross sections are just below the current limits) seen on xenon and
germanium experiments is likely to correctly identify momentum dependence of
the dominant response, ruling out models with either ""heavy"" or ""light""
mediators, and enabling downselection of allowed models. However, a unique
determination of the correct UV completion will critically depend on the
availability of measurements from a wider variety of nuclear targets, including
iodine or fluorine. We investigate how model-selection prospects depend on the

the transit of a planet across its surface, a phenomenon known as the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. The amplitude of the RM effect is related to
the radius of the planet which, because of differential absorption in the
planetary atmosphere, depends on wavelength. Therefore, the
wavelength-dependent RM effect can be used to probe the planetary atmosphere.
We measure for the first time the RM effect of the Earth transiting the Sun

of the Earth's atmosphere after the correction of the solar limb-darkening and
the convective blueshift. The ozone Chappuis band absorption as well as the

equations. Integral equation formulations lead to more compact, but dense
linear systems. These dense systems are often solved iteratively via Krylov
subspace methods, which may be accelerated via the fast multipole method. There
are advantages to Galerkin formulations for such integral equations, as they
treat problems associated with kernel singularity, and lead to symmetric and
better conditioned matrices. However, the Galerkin method requires each entry
in the system matrix to be created via the computation of a double surface
integral over one or more pairs of triangles. There are a number of
semi-analytical methods to treat these integrals, which all have some issues,
and are discussed in this paper. We present novel methods to compute all the

Laplace and Helmholtz Green's functions to any specified accuracy. Integrals
involving completely geometrically separated triangles are non-singular and are
computed using a technique based on spherical harmonics and multipole
expansions and translations, which results in the integration of polynomial
functions over the triangles. Integrals involving cases where the triangles
have common vertices, edges, or are coincident are treated via scaling and

promising way towards synthesizing large area graphene with high quality.
However, it remains a big theoretical challenge to reveal growth kinetics with
atomically energetic and large-scale spatial information included. Here, we
propose a minimal kinetic Monte Carlo model to address such an issue on an
active catalyst surface with graphene/substrate lattice mismatch, which
facilitates us to perform large scale simulations of the growth kinetics over
two dimensional surface with growth fronts of complex shapes. A
geometry-determined large-scale growth mechanism is revealed, where the
rate-dominating event is found to be $C_{1}$-attachment for concave growth
front segments and $C_{5}$-attachment for others. This growth mechanism leads
to an interesting time-resolved growth behavior which is well consistent with
that observed in a recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment.

of statistical mechanics and information thermodynamics. What is remarkable
about nonequilibrium equalities is that they apply to rather general
nonequilibrium situations beyond the linear response regime. However,
nonequilibrium equalities are known to be inapplicable to some important
situations. In this thesis, we introduce a concept of absolute irreversibility
as a new class of irreversibility that encompasses the entire range of those
irreversible situations to which the conventional nonequilibrium equalities are
inapplicable. In mathematical terms, absolute irreversibility corresponds to
the singular part of probability measure and can be separated from the ordinary
irreversible part by Lebesgue's decomposition theorem in measure theory. This
theorem guarantees the uniqueness of the decomposition of probability measure
into singular and nonsingular parts, which enables us to give a well-defined
mathematical and physical meaning to absolute irreversibility. Consequently, we
derive a new type of nonequilibrium equalities in the presence of absolute
irreversibility. Inequalities derived from our nonequilibrium equalities give
stronger restrictions on the entropy production during nonequilibrium processes
than the conventional second-law like inequalities. Moreover, we present a new
resolution of Gibbs' paradox from the viewpoint of absolute irreversibility.
This resolution applies to a classical mesoscopic regime, where two prevailing
resolutions of Gibbs' paradox break down.

directly, our approach adopts a hierarchical mechanism to generate the steering
behaviors of agents. First, each agent is classified into one of the
interaction patterns that are automatically discovered from crowd video before
simulation. Then the most matched action is selected from the associated
interaction pattern to generate the steering behaviors of the agent. By doing
so, agents can avoid performing a simple state matching as in the traditional
example-based approaches, and can perform a wider variety of steering behaviors
as well as mimic the cognitive process of pedestrians. Simulation results on
scenarios with different crowd densities and main motion directions demonstrate
that our approach performs better than two state-of-the-art simulation models,
in terms of prediction accuracy. Besides, our approach is efficient enough to
run at interactive rates in real time simulation.

induced by an external perpendicular electric field in bilayer WSe$_2$. The
Rashba spin-orbit coupling coefficients in bilayer WSe$_2$ are constructed from
the corresponding monolayer ones. In contrast to monolayer WSe$_2$, the
out-of-plane component of the bilayer Rashba spin-orbit coupling acts as a
Zeeman-like field with opposite directions but identical values in the two
valleys. For in-plane spins, this Zeeman-like field, together with the
intervalley hole-phonon scattering, opens an intervalley spin relaxation
channel, which is found to dominate the in-plane spin relaxation in bilayer
WSe$_2$ even at low temperature. For out-of-plane spins, this Zeeman-like field
is superimposed by the identical Hartree-Fock effective magnetic fields in the
two valleys, and hence different total effective magnetic fields between two
valleys are obtained. Owing to the large difference of the total fields at
large spin polarization, different out-of-plane spin relaxation times in the
two valleys are obtained when the intervalley hole-phonon scattering is weak at
low temperature and low hole density. This difference in the spin relaxation
times can be suppressed by enhancing the intervalley hole-phonon scattering
through increasing temperature or hole density. Moreover, at large spin
polarization and low temperature, due to the weak intravalley hole-phonon
scattering but relatively strong hole-hole Coulomb scattering, the fast spin
precessions are found to result in a quasi hot-hole Fermi distribution
characterized by an effective hot-hole temperature larger than the temperature,
which also enhances the intervalley scattering. During this process, it is
interesting to discover that the initially equal hole densities in the two
valleys are broken in the temporal evolution, and a valley polarization is
built up. ....

reduce performance of the orchard progeny due to serious inbreeding. To avoid
inbreeding, we should include a constraint on the numerator relationship matrix
to keep a group coancestry under an appropriate threshold. Though an SDP
(semidefinite programming) approach proposed by Pong-Wong and Woolliams gave an
accurate optimal value, it required rather long computation time.

reduce this computation time. We demonstrate that the same solution is attained

formulation is not much more efficient compared to the SDP approach, we exploit
a sparsity structure of the numerator relationship matrix, and formulate the

When evaluations are very noisy, the error coming from the estimation of the

choosing evaluation points as if several evaluations were going to be made at

reflect electronic structure, the $c$-$f$ hybridization gap between the

the $T_0$ decreases slightly from 27.3 K to 24 K, but the direction of the

hybridization gap in the $\sigma(\omega)$ spectra is strongly suppressed, but
the intensity of the 20-meV peak remains as strong as for $x=0$. These results
suggest that the change of the magnetic moment direction originates from the
decreasing of the $c$-$f$ hybridization intensity. The magnetic ordering

related to the charge excitation at 20 meV observed along the $b$ axis.

application-specific algorithmic steps. This yields a callback-based

$\phi_0$ on an initial $\sigma$-algebra on a set and an invertible map acting
on the latter is considered. Several lower bounds for it are obtained and
sufficient conditions for its positivity are deduced under the general
assumption that there exists an invariant measure $\Lambda$ such that
$\Lambda\ll\phi_0$.
  In particular, DDMs arising from the Hellinger integral
$\mathcal{J}_\alpha(\Lambda,\phi_0)\geq\mathcal{H}^{\alpha,0}(\Lambda,\phi_0)\geq\mathcal{H}_\alpha(\Lambda,\phi_0)$
are constructed with $\mathcal{H}_{0}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q) = \Phi(Q)$,
$\mathcal{H}_{1}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q) = \Lambda(Q)$, and
\[\Phi(Q)^{1-\alpha}\Lambda(Q)^{\alpha}\geq\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q)\]
for all measurable $Q$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$, and further computable lower
bounds for them are obtained and analyzed. The function
$(0,\gamma]\owns\alpha\longmapsto\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}(\Lambda,\phi_0)$ is
computed explicitly for $\gamma\geq 1$ such that
$\int(d\Lambda/d\phi_0)^{\gamma-1}d\Lambda<\infty$ in the case of a discrete
ergodic decomposition of $\Lambda$, and the other two functions are computed
under the additional condition of the equivalence of $\phi_0$ and $\Lambda$. In
particular, if $\Lambda$ is ergodic, it is shown that the first function is
completely determined by the $\Lambda$-essential supremum (infimum) of
$d\Lambda/d\phi_0$ for all $0<\alpha<1$ ($1<\alpha\leq\gamma$), and, if it is
continuous at $0$, the above inequalities become equalities. The computation of
it enables an explicit computation of some DDMs arising as outer measure
approximations with respect to it, which demonstrates that this technique
allows to obtain new measures, and that such measures can have phase
transitions with respect to the DDM specifying the covering sets.

astrophysical cross section factor cannot be extracted with 12% accuracy, or
even close to it. Such data on the S_E2 values at low energies deviate by up to
a factor two from their fit and exhibit a sharper slope rising toward low
energies, leading to strong doubt on their extrapolated S_E2(300) value and the
quoted small error bar. Contrary to their claim the small value of S_E1(300)
~10 keVb cannot be ruled out by current data including the most modern
gamma-ray data. As previously observed by several authors current data reveal
ambiguities in the value of S_E1(300) ~10 keVb or ~80 keVb, and the new
ambiguity that was recently revealed (by this author) of S_E2(300) ~60 keVb or

to perform this sampling with update time $\tilde{O}(1)$. In addition to this,
we show that given oracle access to the edge set, we can implement our
algorithm in time $\tilde{O}(n)$ on a graph in the standard RAM model. To the
best of our knowledge this is the fastest $(0.5-\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for the densest subgraph problem in the RAM model given such oracle
access.
  Further, we extend our results to a general class of graph optimization
problems that we call heavy subgraph problems. This class contains many
interesting problems such as densest subgraph, directed densest subgraph,
densest bipartite subgraph, $d$-cut and $d$-heavy connected component. Our
result, by characterizing heavy subgraph problems, partially addresses open
problem 13 at the IITK Workshop on Algorithms for Data Streams in 2006
regarding the effects of subsampling in this context.

problem of interest to several scientific disciplines. Recently, Zhang and
Moore have introduced an algorithm in [P. Zhang and C. Moore, Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences 111, 18144 (2014)], called mod-bp, that avoids
overfitting the data by optimizing a weighted average of modularity (a popular
goodness-of-fit measure in community detection) and entropy (i.e. number of
configurations with a given modularity). The adjustment of the relative weight,
the ""temperature"" of the model, is crucial for getting a correct result from
mod-bp. In this work we study the many phase transitions that mod-bp may
undergo by changing the two parameters of the algorithm: the temperature $T$
and the maximum number of groups $q$. We introduce a new set of order
parameters that allow to determine the actual number of groups $\hat{q}$, and
we observe on both synthetic and real networks the existence of phases with any
$\hat{q} \in \{1,q\}$, which were unknown before. We discuss how to interpret
the results of mod-bp and how to make the optimal choice for the problem of
detecting significant communities.

recently been developed and it provides a unified and highly predictive
description of both nuclear mean field and pairing correlations. Ground state
properties of finite nuclei can accurately be reproduced without neglecting
exchange (Fock) contributions. Purpose: Finite-temperature RHFB (FT-RHFB)
theory has not yet been developed, leaving yet unknown its predictions for
phase transitions and thermal excitations in both stable and weakly bound
nuclei. Method: FT-RHFB equations are solved in a Dirac Woods-Saxon (DWS) basis
considering two kinds of pairing interactions: finite or zero range. Such a
model is appropriate for describing stable as well as loosely bound nuclei
since the basis states have correct asymptotic behaviour for large spatial
distributions. Results: Systematic FT-RH(F)B calculations are performed for
several semi-magic isotopic/isotonic chains comparing the predictions of a
large number of Lagrangians, among which are PKA1, PKO1 and DD-ME2. It is found
that the critical temperature for a pairing transition generally follows the
rule $T_c = 0.60\Delta(0)$ for a finite-range pairing force and $T_c =
0.57\Delta(0)$ for a contact pairing force, where $\Delta(0)$ is the pairing
gap at zero temperature. Two types of pairing persistence are analysed: type I
pairing persistence occurs in closed subshell nuclei while type II pairing
persistence can occur in loosely bound nuclei strongly coupled to the continuum
states. Conclusions: This first FT-RHFB calculation shows very interesting
features of the pairing correlations at finite temperature and in finite
systems such as pairing re-entrance and pairing persistence.

""carbon-enhanced metal-poor"" stars with no overabundance of s-elements and with
[Fe/H] generally inferior or equal to -2.5. This classification is based on the
changes in abundances for the elements and isotopes involved in the CNO, Ne-Na,
and Mg-Al nuclear cycles. These abundances change very much owing to successive
back and forth mixing motions between the He- and H-burning regions in massive
stars (the ""source stars"" responsible for the chemical enrichment of the
CEMP-no stars). The wide variety of the ratios [C/Fe], 12C/13C, [N/Fe], [O/Fe],
[Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Sr/Fe], and [Ba/Fe], which are the main
characteristics making the CEMP-no and low s stars so peculiar, is described
well in terms of the proposed nucleosynthetic classification. We note that the
[(C+N+O)/Fe] ratios significantly increase for lower values of [Fe/H]. The
classification of CEMP-no stars and the behavior of [(C+N+O)/Fe] support the
presence, in the first stellar generations of the Galaxy, of fast-rotating
massive stars experiencing strong mixing and mass loss (spinstars). This result
has an impact on the early chemical and spectral evolution of the Galaxy.

system of coupled forward-backward stochastic partial differential equations
(FB-SPDEs) with Levy jumps, whose drift, diffusion, and jump coefficients may
involve partial differential operators. A solution to the FB-SPDEs is defined
by a 4-tuple general dimensional random vector-field process evolving in time
together with position parameters over a domain (e.g., a hyperbox or a
manifold). Under an infinite sequence of generalized local linear growth and
Lipschitz conditions, the well-posedness of an adapted 4-tuple strong solution
is proved over a suitably constructed topological space. Second, we consider a
unified system of FB-SDEs, a special form of the FB-SPDEs, however, with skew
boundary reflections. Under randomized linear growth and Lipschitz conditions
together with a general completely-S condition on reflections, we prove the
well-posedness of an adapted 6-tuple weak solution with boundary regulators to
the FB-SDEs by the Skorohod problem and an oscillation inequality.
Particularly, if the spectral radii in some sense for reflection matrices are
strictly less than the unity, an adapted 6-tuple strong solution is concerned.
Third, we formulate a stochastic differential game (SDG) with general number of
players based on the FB-SDEs. By a solution to the FB-SPDEs, we get a solution
to the FB-SDEs under a given control rule and then obtain a Pareto optimal Nash
equilibrium policy process to the SDG. Fourth, we study the applications of the
FB-SPDEs/FB-SDEs in queueing systems and quantum statistics while we use them
to motivate the SDG.

extract theoretical parameters describing the decay and to obtain a relation

disagreement between theoretical expectations and values obtained by fits. The
values of the form factors obtained from experimental data show significant
discrepancies when compared with theoretical expectations in several $q^2$
bins. We emphasize that this discrepancy cannot arise due to resonances and
non-factorizable contributions from charm loops. Further, a relation between
form factors expected to hold at large $q^2$ is very significantly violated.
Finally, the relation between observables also indicates some deviations in the
forward-backward asymmetry in the same $q^2$ regions. These discrepancies are
possible evidence of physics beyond the SM.

adversaries, that can lead to errors in state estimation. This paper presents a
general framework to study attacks on state estimation by adversaries capable
of injecting bad-data into measurements and further, of jamming their
reception. Through these two techniques, a novel `detectable jamming' attack is
designed that changes the state estimation despite failing bad-data detection
checks. Compared to commonly studied `hidden' data attacks, these attacks have
lower costs and a wider feasible operating region. It is shown that the entire
domain of jamming costs can be divided into two regions, with distinct
graph-cut based formulations for the design of the optimal attack. The most
significant insight arising from this result is that the adversarial capability
to jam measurements changes the optimal 'detectable jamming' attack design only
if the jamming cost is less than half the cost of bad-data injection. A
polynomial time approximate algorithm for attack vector construction is
developed and its efficacy in attack design is demonstrated through simulations
on IEEE test systems.

than the Hubble parameter, homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes suffer from the
Higuchi-type ghost or the gradient instability against the linear perturbation
in the bigravity. Hence, the bigravity theory has no healthy massless limit for
cosmological solutions at linear level. In this paper we show that the
instabilities can be resolved by taking into account nonlinear effects of the
scalar graviton mode for an appropriate parameter space of coupling constants.
The growth history in the bigravity can be restored to the result in general
relativity in the early stage of the Universe, in which the St\""uckelberg
fields are nonlinear and there is neither ghost nor gradient instability.
Therefore, the bigravity theory has the healthy massless limit, and cosmology
based on it is viable even when the graviton mass is smaller than the Hubble

intricate equilibrium among several driving forces. On the one hand, the social
pressure exerted by peers favours the emergence of local consensus. On the
other hand, the concurrent participation of agents to discussions on different
topics induces each agent to develop a coherent set of opinions across all the
topics in which he is active. Moreover, the pervasive action of external
stimuli, such as mass media, pulls the entire population towards a specific
configuration of opinions on different topics. Here we propose a model in which
agents with interrelated opinions, interacting on several layers representing
different topics, tend to spread their own ideas to their neighbourhood, strive
to maintain internal coherence, due to the fact that each agent identifies
meaningful relationships among its opinions on the different topics, and are at
the same time subject to external fields, resembling the pressure of mass
media. We show that the presence of heterogeneity in the internal coupling
assigned by agents to their different opinions allows to obtain states with
mixed levels of consensus, still ensuring that all the agents attain a coherent
set of opinions. Furthermore, we show that all the observed features of the
model are preserved in the presence of thermal noise up to a critical
temperature, after which global consensus is no longer attainable. This
suggests the relevance of our results for real social systems, where noise is
inevitably present in the form of information uncertainty and
misunderstandings. The model also demonstrates how mass media can be

low mass black hole. With these parameters fixed, the observed optical/UV
emission directly determines the mass accretion rate through the outer disc and
hence predicts the bolometric luminosity. This is $140-260~\times$ the
Eddington limit. Such a disc should power a strong wind, and winds are
generically expected to be clumpy. Changing inclination angle with respect to a
clumpy wind structure gives a possible explanation for the otherwise puzzling
difference between `complex' NLS1 such as 1H 0707-495 and `simple' ones like PG
1244+026. Lines of sight which intercept the wind show deep absorption features
at iron from the hot phase of the wind, together with stochastic dips and
complex absorption when the clumps occult the X-ray source (complex NLS1),
whereas both these features are absent for more face-on inclination (simple
NLS1). This geometry is quite different to the clean view of a flat disc which
is assumed for the spin measurements in relativistic reflection models, so it
is possible that even 1H 0707-495 has low spin. If so, this re-opens the
simplest and hence very attractive possibility that high black hole spin is a
necessary and sufficient condition to trigger highly relativistic (bulk Lorentz
factor $\sim 10-15$) jets.

consists of \textit{extremal} black hole solutions in higher derivative
theories of gravity defined over an asymptotically AdS space time. The quantum
critical points thus described are supposed to correspond to a very large value

that quantum fluctuations are enhanced due to the higher derivative corrections
in the bulk which in turn increases the possibility of quantum phase transition
near the critical point. On the field theory side, such higher derivative
effects would stand for the corrections appearing due to the finite coupling in
the gauge theory. Finally, we compute the coefficient of thermal diffusion at
finite coupling corresponding to Gauss Bonnet corrected charged Lifshitz black
holes in the bulk. We observe an important crossover corresponding to $ z=5 $

an interference with the background condensate. This offers a unique method of
detecting an edge mode through a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.

compared to a suite of observational data for thermal and scattered light
emission, ranging from the ALMA radial surface brightness profile at 1.3mm to
polarisation measurements in the visible. Most of the data can be reproduced
with a planetesimal belt having an outer edge at around 40au and subsequent
inward transport of dust by stellar winds. A low dynamical excitation of the
planetesimals with eccentricities up to 0.03 is preferred. The radial width of
the planetesimal belt cannot be constrained tightly. Belts that are 5au and
17au wide, as well as a broad 44au-wide belt are consistent with observations.
All models show surface density profiles increasing with distance from the star
as inferred from observations. The best model is achieved by assuming a stellar
mass loss rate that exceeds the solar one by a factor of 50. While the SED and
the shape of the ALMA profile are well reproduced, the models deviate from the
scattered light data more strongly. The observations show a bluer disc colour
and a lower degree of polarisation for projected distances <40au than predicted
by the models. The problem may be mitigated by irregularly-shaped dust grains
which have scattering properties different from the Mie spheres used. From
tests with a handful of selected dust materials, we derive a preference for
mixtures of silicate, carbon, and ice of moderate porosity. We address the
origin of the unresolved central excess emission detected by ALMA and show that
it cannot stem from an additional inner belt alone. Instead, it should derive,
at least partly, from the chromosphere of the central star.

selected pixels and fill in the missing structures by inpainting with a partial
differential equation (PDE). Suitable operators include the Laplacian, the
biharmonic operator, and edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion (EED). The
quality of such approaches depends substantially on the selection of the data
that is kept. Optimising this data in the domain and codomain gives rise to
challenging mathematical problems that shall be addressed in our work.
  In the 1D case, we prove results that provide insights into the difficulty of
this problem, and we give evidence that a splitting into spatial and tonal
(i.e. function value) optimisation does hardly deteriorate the results. In the
2D setting, we present generic algorithms that achieve a high reconstruction
quality even if the specified data is very sparse. To optimise the spatial
data, we use a probabilistic sparsification, followed by a nonlocal pixel
exchange that avoids getting trapped in bad local optima. After this spatial
optimisation we perform a tonal optimisation that modifies the function values
in order to reduce the global reconstruction error. For homogeneous diffusion
inpainting, this comes down to a least squares problem for which we prove that
it has a unique solution. We demonstrate that it can be found efficiently with
a gradient descent approach that is accelerated with fast explicit diffusion
(FED) cycles. Our framework allows to specify the desired density of the
inpainting mask a priori. Moreover, is more generic than other data
optimisation approaches for the sparse inpainting problem, since it can also be
extended to nonlinear inpainting operators such as EED. This is exploited to
achieve reconstructions with state-of-the-art quality.
  We also give an extensive literature survey on PDE-based image compression
methods.

  The agent, upon revealing the content of the allocated envelope, must

the agent's reasoning for a particular outcome that seeks to derive a strategy

Based on a recently proposed method allowing to identify social capitalists, we
tackle both points by studying how they are organized, and how their links
spread across the Twitter follower-followee network. To that aim, we consider
their position in the network w.r.t. its community structure. We use the
concept of community role of a node, which describes its position in a network
depending on its connectiv-ity at the community level. However, the topological
measures originally defined to characterize these roles consider only certain
aspects of the community-related connectivity, and rely on a set of empirically
fixed thresholds. We first show the limitations of these measures, before
extending and generalizing them. Moreover, we use an unsupervised approach to
identify the roles, in order to provide more flexibility relatively to the
studied system. We then apply our method to the case of social capitalists and
show they are highly visible on Twitter, due to the specific roles they hold.

the r-mode instability window of rotating neutron stars. Firstly, we employed a
set of analytical solution of the Tolman-Oppemheimer-Volkoff equations with
special emphasis on the Tolman VII solution. In particular, we tried to clarify
the effects of the bulk neutron star properties (mass, radius, density
distribution, crust size and elasticity) on the r-mode instability window. We
found that the critical angular velocity $\Omega_c$ depends mainly on the
neutron star radius. The effects of the gravitational mass and the mass
distribution are almost negligible. Secondly, we studied the effect of the
elasticity of the crust, via to the slippage factor $S$ and also the effect of
the nuclear equation of state, via the slope parameter $L$, on the instability

originated from the equation of state. Moreover, we proposed simple analytical
expressions which relate the macroscopic quantity $\Omega_c$ to the radius, the

  arXiv:1407:7583",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Luminous Convolution Model (LCM) is an empirical formula, based on a
heuristic convolution of Relativistic transformations, which makes it possible
to predict the observed rotation curves of a broad class of spiral galaxies
from luminous matter alone. Since the LCM is independent of distance estimates
or dark matter halo densities, it is the first model of its kind which
constrains luminous matter modeling directly from the observed spectral shifts
of characteristic photon emission/absorption lines. In this paper we present
the LCM solution to a diverse sample of twenty-five (25) galaxies of varying
morphologies and sizes. For the chosen sample, it is shown that the LCM is more
accurate than either Modified Newtonian Dynamics or dark matter models and
returns physically reasonable mass to light ratios and exponential scale
lengths. Unlike either Modified Newtonian Dynamics or dark matter models, the
LCM predicts something which is directly falsifiable through improvements in
our observational capacity, the luminous mass profile. The question, while
interesting, of if the LCM constrains the relation of the baryonic to dark
matter is beyond the scope of the current work.
  The focus of this paper is to show that it is possible to describe a broad
and diverse spectrum of galaxies efficiently with the LCM formula. Moreover,
since the LCM free parameter predicts the ratio of the Milky Way galaxy
baryonic mass density to that of the galaxy emitting the photon, if the Milky
Way mass models can be trusted at face values, we then show that the LCM
becomes a zero parameter model.

(SSAL) method for solving an optimization problem with both semicontinuous
variables and a cardinality constraint. This optimization problem arises in
several contexts such as the portfolio selection problem, the compressed
sensing problem and the unit commitment problem, etc. The problem is in general
NP-hard. We derive an optimality condition for this optimization problem, under
some suitable assumptions. By introducing an auxiliary variable and using an
augmented Lagrangian function, the constraints are decomposed into two parts.
By fixing particular variables, the optimization problem is split into two
subproblems, which are solved alternatively. Furthermore, we prove the
convergence of SSAL, under some suitable assumptions. Finally, we implement our
method for the portfolio selection problem and the compressed sensing problem,
respectively. Real world data and simulation study show that SSAL outperforms
the well-known CPLEX 12.6 and the penalty decomposition (PD) method, while
enjoying a similar cardinality of decision variable. For example, the numerical
results are even nearly 200 times faster than that of CPLEX 12.6 for the
portfolio selection problem, and more than 40 times faster than PD method for
the compressed sensing problem, respectively. In particularly, SSAL is powerful
when the size of problem increase largely.

absorption of light changes as the magnetic field or the direction of light

contribute to this absorption asymmetry known as non-reciprocal directional

conclude that the non-reciprocal directional dichroism in \BF is dominated by
the spin-current polarization and is insensitive to the magnetostriction and
easy-axis anisotropy. With three independent spin-current parameters, our model
accurately describes the non-reciprocal directional dichroism observed for

light traveling in one direction but opaque for light traveling in the opposite

highly influenced by how the figure of merit to be optimized behaves as a
function of the control field, i.e. by the control landscape. Constraints on
the control field introduce local minima in the landscape --false traps-- which
might prevent an efficient solution of the optimal control problem. Rabitz et
al. [Science 303, 1998 (2004)] showed that local minima occur only rarely for
unconstrained optimization. Here, we extend this result to the case of
bandwidth-limited control pulses showing that in this case one can eliminate
the false traps arising from the constraint. Based on this theoretical
understanding, we modify the Chopped Random Basis (CRAB) optimal control
algorithm and show that this development exploits the advantages of both
(unconstrained) gradient algorithms and of truncated basis methods, allowing to
always follow the gradient of the unconstrained landscape by bandwidth-limited
control functions. We study the effects of additional constraints and show that
for reasonable constraints the convergence properties are still maintained.
Finally, we numerically show that this approach saturates the theoretical bound

magnetic dipole braking in vacuum is still often assumed. It is shown that the

crowds. The flow field that is generated by the movement in the crowd is
treated just like an aperiodic dynamic system. On this flow field a grid of
particles is put over for particle advection by the use of a numerical
integration scheme. Then flow maps are generated which associates the initial
position of the particles with final position. The gradient of the flow maps
gives the amount of divergence of the neighboring particles. For forward
integration and analysis forward Finite time Lyapunov Exponent is calculated
and backward Finite time Lyapunov Exponent is also calculated it gives the
Lagrangian coherent structures of the flow in crowd. Lagrangian Coherent
Structures basically divides the flow in crowd into regions and these regions
have different dynamics. These regions are then used to get the boundary in the
different flow segments by using water shed algorithm. The experiment is
conducted on the crowd dataset of UCF (University of central Florida).

investigation of the fluid-mechanical properties of a dark energy fluid, which
is characterised by its sound speed and its viscosity apart from its equation
of state. In particular, we compute the predicted spectra for the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect for our generalised fluid, and compare them with the
corresponding predictions for weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering,
which had been computed in previous work. We perform statistical forecasts and
show that the integrated Sachs-Wolfe signal obtained by cross correlating
Euclid galaxies with Planck temperatures, when joined to galaxy clustering and
weak lensing observations, yields a percent sensitivity on the dark energy

degeneracy breaking for low sound speeds and large differences between the
sound speed and viscosity parameters.

naturally during evolution, through a transition in the units of individuality.
We will show how these transitions are the result of competing selective forces
operating at different levels of organization, each level having different
units of individuality. Such a transition represents a singular point in the
evolutionary process, which we will show corresponds to a phase transition in
the way information is encoded, with the formation of self-reinforcing
information bottlenecks. We present an abstract model for characterizing these
transitions that is quite general, applicable to many different versions of
such transitions. As a concrete example, we consider the transition to
multicellularity. Specifically, we study a stochastic model where isolated
communities of interacting individuals (e.g. cells) undergo a transition to
higher-order individuality (e.g. multicellularity). This transition is
indicated by the marked decrease in the number of cells utilized to generate
new communities from pre-existing ones. In this sense, the community begins to
reproduce as a whole via a decreasing number of cells. We show that the fitness
barrier to this transition is strongly reduced by horizontal gene transfer.
These features capture two of the most prominent aspects of the transition to
multicellularity: the evolution of a developmental process and reproduction
through a unicellular bottleneck.

greenhouse gases, which have dominated climate variability over the Quaternary.
The dominant periodicity of the cycles is $\sim $40 kyr before the so-called
middle Pleistocene transition between $\sim$1.2 and $\sim$0.7 Myr ago, and it
is $\sim $100 kyr after the transition. In this paper, the dynamics of
glacial-interglacial cycles are investigated using a phase oscillator model
forced by the time-varying incoming solar radiation (insolation). We analyze
the bifurcations of the system and show that strange nonchaotic attractors
appear through nonsmooth saddle-node bifurcations of tori. The bifurcation
analysis indicates that mode-locking is likely to occur for the 41 kyr glacial
cycles but not likely for the 100 kyr glacial cycles. The sequence of
mode-locked 41 kyr cycles is robust to small parameter changes. However, the
sequence of 100 kyr glacial cycles can be sensitive to parameter changes when
the system has a strange nonchaotic attractor.

For a discrete memory-less channel (DMC), they showed that the frame length $N$

asymptotically with $A$. $\alpha(Q)$ is the synchronization threshold and $Q$
is channel transition probability. We study the sequential frame
synchronisation problem for a fading channel and additive noise and seek to
characterise the effect of fading. For a discrete ON-OFF fading channel (with
ON probability $p$) and additive noise (with channel transition probabilities
$Q_n$), we characterise the synchronisation threshold of the composite channel
$\alpha(Q)$ and show that $\alpha(Q)\leq p\,\alpha(Q_n)$. We then characterize
the synchronization threshold for Rayleigh fading and AWGN channel as a
function of channel parameters. The asynchronous framework permits a trade-off
between sync frame length, $N$, and channel, $Q$, to support asynchronism. This
allows us to characterize the synchronization threshold with sync frame energy

pockets seen by the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The
recently discovered (Li1-xFexOH)FeSe phase with Tc=40 K provides a good

presence of double anisotropic gaps with maximum magnitudes of Delta_1=14.3 meV
and Delta_2=8.6 meV, and mimics that of the monolayer FeSe thin film. Further
analysis based on the quasiparticle interference (QPI) allows us to rule out
the d-wave gap, and for the first time assign the larger (smaller) gap to the
outer (inner) hybridized Fermi pockets associating with the dxy (dxz/dyz)

datasets and complex data analytics methods. The machine learning methods used
in bioinformatics are iterative and parallel. These methods can be scaled to
handle big data using the distributed and parallel computing technologies.
  Usually big data tools perform computation in batch-mode and are not
optimized for iterative processing and high data dependency among operations.
In the recent years, parallel, incremental, and multi-view machine learning
algorithms have been proposed. Similarly, graph-based architectures and
in-memory big data tools have been developed to minimize I/O cost and optimize
iterative processing.
  However, there lack standard big data architectures and tools for many
important bioinformatics problems, such as fast construction of co-expression
and regulatory networks and salient module identification, detection of
complexes over growing protein-protein interaction data, fast analysis of
massive DNA, RNA, and protein sequence data, and fast querying on incremental
and heterogeneous disease networks. This paper addresses the issues and
challenges posed by several big data problems in bioinformatics, and gives an
overview of the state of the art and the future research opportunities.

  high-granularity semi-digital hadronic calorimeter","49 pages, 41 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large prototype of 1.3m3 was designed and built as a demonstrator of the
semi-digital hadronic calorimeter (SDHCAL) concept proposed for the future ILC
experiments. The prototype is a sampling hadronic calorimeter of 48 units. Each
unit is built of an active layer made of 1m2 Glass Resistive Plate
Chamber(GRPC) detector placed inside a cassette whose walls are made of
stainless steel. The cassette contains also the electronics used to read out
the GRPC detector. The lateral granularity of the active layer is provided by
the electronics pick-up pads of 1cm2 each. The cassettes are inserted into a
self-supporting mechanical structure built also of stainless steel plates
which, with the cassettes walls, play the role of the absorber. The prototype
was designed to be very compact and important efforts were made to minimize the
number of services cables to optimize the efficiency of the Particle Flow
Algorithm techniques to be used in the future ILC experiments. The different
components of the SDHCAL prototype were studied individually and strict
criteria were applied for the final selection of these components. Basic
calibration procedures were performed after the prototype assembling. The
prototype is the first of a series of new-generation detectors equipped with a
power-pulsing mode intended to reduce the power consumption of this highly
granular detector. A dedicated acquisition system was developed to deal with
the output of more than 440000 electronics channels in both trigger and
triggerless modes. After its completion in 2011, the prototype was commissioned
using cosmic rays and particles beams at CERN.

negligible pressure) along with dark energy in the background of Galileon
gravity is considered. Four dark energy models with different EoS
parametrizations have been employed namely, Linear, CPL, JBP and Logarithmic
parametrizations. From Stern, Stern+BAO and Stern+BAO+CMB joint data analysis,
we have obtained the bounds of the arbitrary parameters $\omega_{0}$ and
$\omega_{1}$ by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$ test. The best-fit values and bounds
of the parameters are obtained at 66\%, 90\% and 99\% confidence levels which
are shown by closed confidence contours in the figures. For the logarithmic
model unbounded confidence contours are obtained and hence the model parameters
could not be finitely constrained. The distance modulus $\mu$(z) against
redshift $z$ has also been plotted for our predicted theoretical models for the
best fit values of the parameters and compared with the observed Union2 data
sample and SNe Type Ia 292 data and we have shown that our predicted
theoretical models permits the observational data sets. From the data fitting
it is seen that at lower redshifts $(z<0.3)$ the SNe Type Ia 292 data gives a
better fit with our theoretical models compared to the Union2 data sample. So,
from the data analysis, SNe Type Ia 292 data is the more favoured data sample
over its counterpart given the present choice of free parameters. From the
study, it is also seen that the logarithmic parametrization model is less
supported by the observational data. Finally we have generated the plot for the
deceleration parameter against the redshift parameter for all the theoretical
models and compared the results with the work of Farooq et al, 2013.

considerable interest in monitoring financial stability. Several central banks
now publish indices of financial stress, which are essentially based upon
market related data. In this paper, we examine the potential for improving the
indices by deriving information about emotion shifts in the economy. We report
on a new approach, based on the content analysis of very large text databases,
and termed directed algorithmic text analysis. The algorithm identifies, very
rapidly, shifts through time in the relations between two core emotional
groups. The method is robust. The same word-list is used to identify the two
emotion groups across different studies. Membership of the words in the lists
has been validated in psychological experiments. The words consist of everyday
English words with no specific economic meaning. Initial results show promise.
An emotion index capturing shifts between the two emotion groups in texts
potentially referring to the whole US economy improves the one-quarter ahead
consensus forecasts for real GDP growth. More specifically, the same indices
are shown to Granger cause both the Cleveland and St Louis Federal Reserve
Indices of Financial Stress.
