clustering and regularization models are widely used in machine learning and
computer vision, but they were not combined before due to significant
differences in the corresponding optimization, e.g. spectral relaxation and
combinatorial max-flow techniques. On the one hand, we show that many common
applications using MRF segmentation energies can benefit from a high-order NC
term, e.g. enforcing balanced clustering of arbitrary high-dimensional image
features combining color, texture, location, depth, motion, etc. On the other
hand, standard clustering applications can benefit from an inclusion of common
pairwise or higher-order MRF constraints, e.g. edge alignment, bin-consistency,
label cost, etc. To address joint energies like NC+MRF, we propose efficient
Kernel Cut algorithms based on bound optimization. While focusing on graph cut
and move-making techniques, our new unary (linear) kernel and spectral bound
formulations for common pairwise clustering criteria allow to integrate them
with any regularization functionals with existing discrete or continuous
solvers.

motivation for this paper stems from the Well Elderly 2 study, a portion of
which was aimed at understanding the association between the cortisol awakening

  COBS indicated what appeared be an usual form of curvature. The modified
running interval smoother gave a strikingly different estimate, which raised
the issue of how it compares to COBS in terms of mean squared error and bias as
well as its ability to avoid a spurious indication of curvature. R functions

is virtually invariant to the strength of the friction applied to the internal

transmission phase shift of an electron, providing useful information on
coherent scattering problems. In mesoscopic systems, however, the two-path
interference is easily smeared by contributions from other paths, and this
makes it difficult to observe the \textit{true} transmission phase shift. To
eliminate this problem, multi-terminal Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometers have
been used to derive the phase shift by assuming that the relative phase shift
of the electrons between the two paths is simply obtained when a smooth shift
of the AB oscillations is observed. Nevertheless the phase shifts using such a
criterion have sometimes been inconsistent with theory. On the other hand, we
have used an AB ring contacted to tunnel-coupled wires and acquired the phase
shift consistent with theory when the two output currents through the coupled
wires oscillate with well-defined anti-phase. Here, we investigate thoroughly
these two criteria used to ensure a reliable phase measurement, the anti-phase
relation of the two output currents and the smooth phase shift in the AB
oscillation. We confirm that the well-defined anti-phase relation ensures a
correct phase measurement with a quantum two-path interference. In contrast we
find that even in a situation where the anti-phase relation is less
well-defined, the smooth phase shift in the AB oscillation can still occur but
does not give the correct transmission phase due to contributions from multiple
paths. This indicates that the phase relation of the two output currents in our
interferometer gives a good criterion for the measurement of the \textit{true}
transmission phase while the smooth phase shift in the AB oscillation itself
does not.

the currently accepted theory that the hottest horizontal branch members (the
blue hook stars, which had late helium-core flash ignition, followed by deep
mixing) are the progeny of a helium-rich ""second generation"" of stars. It is
not known why such a supposedly rare event (a late flash followed by mixing) is
so common that the blue hook of {\omega} Cen contains \sim 30% of horizontal

cannot be reproduced by models. Here we report that the presence of helium core
masses up to \sim 0.04 solar masses larger than the core mass resulting from

taking into account the dispersion in rotation rates achieved by the
progenitors, whose premain sequence accretion disc suffered an early disruption
in the dense environment of the cluster's central regions where
second-generation stars form. Rotation may also account for frequent
late-flash-mixing events in massive globular clusters.

contributions of new physics, provide a powerful tool to test the theory and to
discriminate between different models of the underlying physics. In that
context, the $W$ boson mass, $M_W$, plays a crucial role. The accuracy of the
$M_W$ measurement has been significantly improved over the last years, and
further improvement of the experimental accuracy is expected from future LHC
measurements. In order to fully exploit the precise experimental determination,
an accurate theoretical prediction for $M_W$ in the Standard Model (SM) and
extensions of it is of central importance. We present the currently most
accurate prediction for the $W$ boson mass in the Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (NMSSM), including the full
one-loop result and all available higher-order corrections of SM and SUSY type.
The evaluation of $M_W$ is performed in a flexible framework, which facilitates
the extension to other models beyond the SM. We show numerical results for the
$W$ boson mass in the NMSSM, focussing on phenomenologically interesting
scenarios, in which the Higgs signal can be interpreted as the lightest or
second lightest CP-even Higgs boson of the NMSSM. We find that, for both Higgs
signal interpretations, the NMSSM $M_W$ prediction is well compatible with the
measurement. We study the SUSY contributions to $M_W$ in detail and investigate
in particular the genuine NMSSM effects from the Higgs and neutralino sectors.

considerably contributed to the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN),
we have witnessed an ever-increasing WSN based applications which induced a
host of research activities in both academia and industry. Since most of the
target WSN applications are very sensitive, security issue is one of the major
challenges in the deployment of WSN. One of the important building blocks in
securing WSN is key management. Traditional key management solutions developed
for other networks are not suitable for WSN since WSN networks are resource
(e.g. memory, computation, energy) limited. Key pre-distribution algorithms
have recently evolved as efficient alternatives of key management in these
networks. In the key pre-distribution systems, secure communication is achieved
between a pair of nodes either by the existence of a key allowing for direct
communication or by a chain of keys forming a key-path between the pair. In
this paper, we propose methods which bring prior knowledge of network
characteristics and application constraints into the design of key
pre-distribution schemes, in order to provide better security and connectivity
while requiring less resources. Our methods are based on casting the prior
information as a graph. Motivated by this idea, we also propose a class of
quasi-symmetric designs referred here to as g-designs. These produce key
pre-distribution schemes that significantly improve upon the existing
constructions based on unital designs. We give some examples, and point out
open problems for future research.

that some covariate $X=x$. When $M_j(x)$ is a robust measure of location, or
even some conditional quantile of $Y$, given $X$, methods have been proposed
and studied that are aimed at testing $H_0$: $M_1(x)=M_2(x)$ that deal with
curvature in a flexible manner. In addition, methods have been studied where
the goal is to control the probability of one or more Type I errors when
testing $H_0$ for each $x \in \{x_1, \ldots, x_p\}$. This paper suggests a
method for testing the global hypothesis $H_0$: $M_1(x)=M_2(x)$ for $\forall x
\in \{x_1, \ldots, x_p\}$ when using a robust or quantile location estimator.
An obvious advantage of testing $p$ hypotheses, rather than the global
hypothesis, is that it can provide information about where regression lines
differ and by how much. But the paper summarizes three general reasons to
suspect that testing the global hypothesis can have more power. 2 Data from the
Well Elderly 2 study illustrate that testing the global hypothesis can make a

solution for cellular operators in order to meet the ever growing bandwidth
requirements and ease the spectrum crunch problem. In order to realize
efficient spectrum sharing, interference mitigation techniques are required. In
this letter we address techniques to mitigate MIMO radar interference at MIMO
cellular base stations (BSs). We specifically look at the amount of power
received at BSs when radar uses null space projection (NSP)-based interference
mitigation method. NSP reduces the amount of projected power at targets that
are in-close vicinity to BSs. We study this issue and show that this can be
avoided if radar employs a larger transmit array. In addition, we compute the
coherence time of channel between radar and BSs and show that the coherence
time of channel is much larger than the pulse repetition interval of radars.
Therefore, NSP-based interference mitigation techniques which depends on
accurate channel state information (CSI) can be effective as the problem of CSI
being outdated does not occur for most practical scenarios.

populations of interacting individuals. A common assumption in evolutionary
game theory is that interactions are symmetric, which means that the players
are distinguished by only their strategies. In nature, however, the microscopic
interactions between players are nearly always asymmetric due to environmental
effects, differing baseline characteristics, and other possible sources of
heterogeneity. To model these phenomena, we introduce into evolutionary game
theory two broad classes of asymmetric interactions: ecological and genotypic.
Ecological asymmetry results from variation in the environments of the players,
while genotypic asymmetry is a consequence of the players having differing
baseline genotypes. We develop a theory of these forms of asymmetry for games
in structured populations and use the classical social dilemmas, the Prisoner's
Dilemma and the Snowdrift Game, for illustrations. Interestingly, asymmetric
games reveal essential differences between models of genetic evolution based on
reproduction and models of cultural evolution based on imitation that are not
apparent in symmetric games.

Temperature-dependent transport measurements reveal activated transport at low
temperatures due to surface donors, while at room temperature the transport
shows a diffusive behavior. From the conductivity data, the extracted value of
sound velocity in InAs nanowires is found to be an order less than the bulk.
This low sound velocity is attributed to the extended crystal defects that
ubiquitously appear in these nanowires. Analyzing the temperature-dependent
mobility data, we identify the key scattering mechanisms limiting the carrier
transport in these nanowires. Finally, using these scattering models, we
perform drift-diffusion based transport simulations of a nanowire field-effect
transistor and compare the device performances with experimental measurements.
Our device modeling provides insight into performance limits of InAs nanowire
transistors and can be used as a predictive methodology for nanowire-based

We study the effects of bSM physics scenarios on the top quark polarization and
on the kinematics of the decay leptons. To this end, we construct asymmetries
using the lepton energy and angular distributions. Further, we find their
correlations with the top polarization, net charge asymmetry and top forward
backward asymmetry. We show that used together, these observables can help
discriminate effectively between SM and different bSM scenarios which can lead
to varying degrees of top polarization at the Tevatron as well as the LHC. We

vector $x$ in a shifted lattice $L - t$ probability proportional to $e^{-\pi
\|x\|^2/s^2}$. It has long been an important tool in the study of lattices.
More recently, algorithms for discrete Gaussian sampling (DGS) have found many
applications in computer science. In particular, polynomial-time algorithms for
DGS with very high parameters $s$ have found many uses in cryptography and in
reductions between lattice problems. And, in the past year, Aggarwal, Dadush,
Regev, and Stephens-Davidowitz showed $2^{n+o(n)}$-time algorithms for DGS with
a much wider range of parameters and used them to obtain the current fastest
known algorithms for the two most important lattice problems, the Shortest
Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP).
  Motivated by its increasing importance, we investigate the complexity of DGS
itself and its relationship to CVP and SVP. Our first result is a
polynomial-time dimension-preserving reduction from DGS to CVP. There is a
simple reduction from CVP to DGS, so this shows that DGS is equivalent to CVP.
Our second result, which we find to be more surprising, is a polynomial-time
dimension-preserving reduction from centered DGS (the important special case
when $ t = 0$) to SVP. In the other direction, there is a simple reduction from
$\gamma$-approximate SVP for any $\gamma = \Omega(\sqrt{n/\log n})$, and we
present some (relatively weak) evidence to suggest that this might be the best
achievable approximation factor.
  We also show that our CVP result extends to a much wider class of
distributions and even to other norms.

The macroscopic properties in thermal equilibrium of such a system, determined

e.g., spatial uniformity of temperature and chemical potential. When this is
true we say that the system is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium (MATE). Such
a system may however not be in microscopic thermal equilibrium (MITE). The
latter requires that the reduced density matrices of small subsystems be close
to those obtained from the microcanonical, equivalently the canonical, ensemble
for the whole system. The distinction between MITE and MATE is particularly
relevant for systems with many-body localization (MBL) for which the energy
eigenfunctions fail to be in MITE while necessarily most of them, but not all,
are in MATE. We note however that for generic macroscopic systems, including
those with MBL, most wave functions in an energy shell are in both MATE and

the energy surface, but MITE fails to hold for any phase point.

clinical trials on cancer. In prostate cancer for example, these models permit
to account for the link between longitudinal measures of prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) and the time of clinical recurrence when studying the risk of
relapse. In practice, multiple types of relapse may occur successively.
Distinguishing these transitions between health states would allow to evaluate,
for example, how PSA trajectory and classical covariates impact the risk of
dying after a distant recurrence post-radiotherapy, or to predict the risk of
one specific type of clinical recurrence post-radiotherapy, from the PSA
history. In this context, we present a joint model for a longitudinal process
and a multi-state process which is divided into two sub-models: a linear mixed
sub-model for longitudinal data, and a multi-state sub-model with proportional
hazards for transition times, both linked by shared random effects. Parameters
of this joint multi-state model are estimated within the maximum likelihood
framework using an EM algorithm coupled to a quasi-Newton algorithm in case of
slow convergence. It is implemented under R, by combining and extending the
mstate and JM packages. The estimation program is validated by simulations and
applied on pooled data from two cohorts of men with localized prostate cancer
and treated by radiotherapy. Thanks to the classical covariates available at
baseline and the PSA measurements collected repeatedly during the follow-up, we
are able to assess the biomarker's trajectory, define the risks of transitions
between health states, and quantify the impact of the PSA dynamics on each
transition intensity.

knowledge about which rounds will be used for parameter estimation or key
distillation. Here we show that this assumption is violated for iterative
sifting, a sifting procedure that has been employed in some (but not all) of
the recently suggested QKD protocols in order to increase their efficiency. We
show that iterative sifting leads to two security issues: (1) some rounds are
more likely to be key rounds than others, (2) the public communication of past
measurement choices changes this bias round by round. We analyze these two
previously unnoticed problems, present eavesdropping strategies that exploit
them, and find that the two problems are independent. We discuss some sifting
protocols in the literature that are immune to these problems. While some of
these would be inefficient replacements for iterative sifting, we find that the
sifting subroutine of an asymptotically secure protocol suggested by Lo et al
(2005 J. Cryptol. 18 133-65), which we call LCA sifting, has an efficiency on
par with that of iterative sifting. One of our main results is to show that LCA
sifting can be adapted to achieve secure sifting in the finite-key regime. More
precisely, we combine LCA sifting with a certain parameter estimation protocol,
and we prove the finite-key security of this combination. Hence we propose that
LCA sifting should replace iterative sifting in future QKD implementations.
More generally, we present two formal criteria for a sifting protocol that
guarantee its finite-key security. Our criteria may guide the design of future
protocols and inspire a more rigorous QKD analysis, which has neglected
sifting-related attacks so far.

framework to redshift space, computing the power spectrum P_s(k,mu) in massive
neutrino cosmologies with time-dependent dark energy equations of state w(z).
Time-RG is uniquely capable of incorporating scale-dependent growth into the
P_s(k,mu) computation, which is important for massive neutrinos as well as
modified gravity models. Although changes to w(z) and the neutrino mass
fraction both affect the late-time scale-dependence of the non-linear power
spectrum, we find that the two effects depend differently on the line-of-sight
angle mu. Finally, we use the HACC N-body code to quantify errors in the
perturbative calculations. For a LambdaCDM model at redshift z=1, our procedure
predicts the monopole~(quadrupole) to 1% accuracy up to a wave number 0.19h/Mpc
(0.28h/Mpc), compared to 0.08h/Mpc (0.07h/Mpc) for the Kaiser approximation and

emission from neutral hydrogen has only been detected directly out to z~0.2,
limited by the sensitivity and instantaneous bandwidth of current radio
telescopes. We discuss how current and future radio interferometers such as the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will detect lensed HI emission in individual
galaxies at high redshift. Our calculations rely on a semi-analytic galaxy
simulation with realistic HI disks (by size, density profile and rotation), in
a cosmological context, combined with general relativistic ray tracing.
Wide-field, blind HI surveys with the SKA are predicted to be efficient at
discovering lensed HI systems, increasingly so at z > 2. This will be enabled
by the combination of the magnification boosts, the steepness of the HI
luminosity function at the high-mass end, and the fact that the HI spectral
line is relatively isolated in frequency. These surveys will simultaneously
provide a new technique for foreground lens selection and yield the highest
redshift HI emission detections. More near term (and existing) cm-wave
facilities will push the high redshift HI envelope through targeted surveys of
known lenses.

into the problem, giving rise to its own renormalization group with respect to
this new scale. Two contradicting claims exist in the literature concerning
rapidity scale uncertainty. One camp has shown that the results of perturbative

derived an all-order factorization formula with no dependence on rapidity
scale, by using a form of analytic regulator to regulate rapidity divergences.
We deliver a simple resolution to this controversy by deriving an alternative
form of the all-order factorization formula with an analytic regulator that,
despite being formally rapidity scale independent, reveals how rapidity scale
dependence arises when it is truncated at a finite order in perturbation
theory. With our results, one can continue to take advantage of the technical
ease and simplicity of the analytic regulator approach while correctly taking
into account rapidity scale dependence. As an application, we update our
earlier study of WW production with jet-veto by including rapidity scale
uncertainty. While the central values of the predictions are unchanged, the
scale uncertainties are increased and consistency between the NLL and NNLL

early matter-dominated (MD) era that ends at temperature $T_R \ll {\rm TeV}$.
Compared to the conventional radiation-dominated (RD) results, yields from both
Freeze-Out and Freeze-In processes are greatly suppressed by dilution from
entropy production, making Freeze-Out less plausible while allowing successful
Freeze-In with a much larger coupling strength. Freeze-In is typically
dominated by the decay of a particle $B$ of the thermal bath, $B \rightarrow
X$. For a large fraction of the relevant cosmological parameter space, the
decay rate required to produce the observed dark matter abundance leads to
displaced signals at LHC and future colliders, for any $m_X$ in the range ${\rm
keV} < m_X < m_B$ and for values of $m_B$ accessible to these colliders. This
result applies whether the early MD era arises after conventional inflation,
when $T_R$ is the usual reheat temperature, or is a generic MD era with an
alternative origin. In the former case, if $m_X$ is sufficiently large to be
measured from kinematics, the reheat temperature $T_R$ can be extracted. Our
result is independent of the particular particle physics implementation of $B
\rightarrow X$, and can occur via any operator of dimension less than 8 (4) for
a post-inflation (general MD) cosmology. An interesting example is provided by
DFS axion theories with TeV-scale supersymmetry and axino dark matter of mass
GeV to TeV, which is typically overproduced in a conventional RD cosmology. If
$B$ is the higgsino, $\tilde h$, Higgs, W and Z particles appear at the
displaced decays, $\tilde h \rightarrow h \tilde a, Z \tilde a$ and $\tilde
h^\pm \rightarrow W^\pm \tilde a$. The scale of axion physics, $f$, is
predicted to be in the range $(3\times10^8 - 10^{12})$ GeV and, over much of

to the shading of the mask a cross section is produced in the sample. The slope
of this cross section is considerably shallower than given by the geometrical

sputter cascades in the transition area between sputtered and shaded sample

studied here using a 104.6 nm thick SiO2 layer thermally grown on a Si

gas-rich interacting galaxies. In contrast to what is generally assumed to be
the case for isolated dwarf galaxies, TDGs are not embedded in their own dark
matter (DM) sub-halo. Hence, they are more sensitive to stellar feedback and
could be disrupted on a short time-scale. Detailed numerical and observational
studies demonstrate that isolated DM-dominated dwarf galaxies can have
lifetimes of more than 10 Gyr. For TDGs that evolve in a tidal field with
compressing accelerations equal to the gravitational acceleration within a DM
sub-halo typical of an isolated dwarf galaxy, a similar survival time is
expected. The tidal acceleration profile depends on the virial mass of the host
galaxy and the distance between the TDG and its host. We analytically compare
the tidal compression to the gravitational acceleration due to either cuspy or
cored DM sub-halos of various virial masses. For example, the tidal field at a
distance of 100 kpc to a host halo of 10^13 Msol can be as stabilizing as a
10^9 Msol DM sub-halo. By linking the tidal field to the equivalent
gravitational field of a DM sub-halo, we can use existing models of isolated
dwarfs to estimate the survivability of TDGs. We show that part of the
unexpectedly high dynamical masses inferred from observations of some TDGs can
be explained by tidal compression and hence TDGs require to contain less
unobservable matter to understand their rotation curves.

Reverberation Mapping project. Clear detection of stellar absorption lines
allows a reliable decomposition of the observed spectra into nuclear and host
components, using spectral models of quasar and stellar radiations as well as
emission lines from the interstellar medium. We estimate age, mass (M*), and
velocity dispersion (sigma*) of the host stars, the star formation rate (SFR),
quasar luminosity, and SMBH mass (Mbh), for each object. The quasars are
preferentially hosted by massive galaxies with M* ~ 10^{11} Msun characterized
by stellar ages around a billion years, which coincides with the transition
phase of normal galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence. The host
galaxies have relatively low SFRs and fall below the main sequence of
star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. These facts suggest that the hosts
have experienced an episode of major star formation sometime in the past
billion years, which was subsequently quenched or suppressed. The derived Mbh -
sigma* and Mbh - M* relations agree with our past measurements and are
consistent with no evolution from the local Universe. The present analysis
demonstrates that reliable measurements of stellar properties of quasar host
galaxies are possible with high-SNR fiber spectra, which will be acquired in
large numbers with future powerful instruments such as the Subaru Prime Focus
Spectrograph.

described by a power law of the form $T_{\mathrm{gas}}(r) \propto r^{-0.6}$,

present over 12 years of V band photometry, part of which overlaps our

density variability at V band with most radio wavelengths. This correlation is
likely due to shock waves induced by stellar pulsations, which heat the inner
atmosphere and ionize the more extended atmosphere through radiative means.
Stellar pulsations may play an important role in exciting Betelgeuse's extended

The signature of this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when
the planet and its escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper

numerical trace of the velocity field is the only globally coupled unknown,
this scheme allows a very efficient implementation of the method. For the
stationary case, and under the usual smallness condition for the source term,
we prove that the method is well defined and that the global L2-norm of the
error in each of the above-mentioned variables and the discrete H1-norm of the
error in the velocity converge with the order of k+1 for k>=0. We also show
that for k>=1, the global L2-norm of the error in velocity converges with the
order of k+2. From the point of view of degrees of freedom of the globally
coupled unknown: numerical trace, this method achieves optimal convergence for
all the above-mentioned variables in L2-norm for k>=0, superconvergence for the
velocity in the discrete H1-norm without postprocessing for k>=0, and
superconvergence for the velocity in L2-norm without postprocessing for k>=1.

shows a large incidence of P-Cygni profiles (11%). We find support for many of
the conclusions reached in a study based on the analysis of the He I 10830
angstrom line in a large sample of HAEBES. Namely, HAEBES exhibit smaller
fractions of both blue-shifted absorption (i.e. mass outflow) and red-shifted
absorption (i.e. mass infall or accretion) than their lower mass cousins, the
classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). In particular, the optical data supports the
conclusion that HAEBES displaying red-shifted absorption, in general, show
maximum red-shifted absorption velocities that are smaller fractions of their
stellar escape velocities than is found for CTTSs. This suggests that HAEBE
accretion flows are originating deeper in the gravitational potentials of their
stars than in CTTS systems. In addition, we find a lack of inner disk wind
signatures in the blue-shifted absorption objects; only stellar wind signatures
are clearly observed. These findings, along with the lack of detected magnetic
fields around HAEBES, support the idea that large magnetospheres are not
prevalent around HAEBES and that accretion flows are instead mediated by
significantly smaller magnetospheres with relatively smaller truncation radii
(e.g. 1-2 stellar radii). Red-shifted absorption is much more common around
Herbig Ae stars than Be stars, suggesting that Herbig Be stars may accrete via
a boundary layer rather than along magnetic field lines.

planar annulus, i.e., a bounded, two-connected, Jordan domain, endowed with a
sequence of triangulations exhausting it. We construct a corresponding sequence
of maps which converge uniformly on compact subsets of the domain, to a
conformal homeomorphism onto the interior of a Euclidean annulus bounded by two
concentric circles. The resolution of Stephenson's Conjecture then follows by a

It pursues the
emulation of the posterior probability density. The starting point is a series
expansion of the likelihood function in terms of orthogonal polynomials. From
this spectral likelihood expansion all statistical quantities of interest can
be calculated semi-analytically. The posterior is formally represented as the
product of a reference density and a linear combination of polynomial basis
functions. Both the model evidence and the posterior moments are related to the
expansion coefficients. This formulation avoids Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulation and allows one to make use of linear least squares instead. The pros
and cons of spectral Bayesian inference are discussed and demonstrated on the
basis of simple applications from classical statistics and inverse modeling.

significantly in both random reads and writes. However, heavy random writes
trigger fre- quent garbage collection and decrease the performance of SSDs. In
an SSD array, garbage collection of individ- ual SSDs is not synchronized,
leading to underutilization of some of the SSDs.
  We propose a software solution to tackle the unsyn- chronized garbage
collection in an SSD array installed in a host bus adaptor (HBA), where
individual SSDs are exposed to an operating system. We maintain a long I/O
queue for each SSD and flush dirty pages intelligently to fill the long I/O
queues so that we hide the performance imbalance among SSDs even when there are
few parallel application writes. We further define a policy of select- ing
dirty pages to flush and a policy of taking out stale flush requests to reduce
the amount of data written to SSDs. We evaluate our solution in a real system.
Experi- ments show that our solution fully utilizes all SSDs in an array under
random write-heavy workloads. It improves I/O throughput by up to 62% under
random workloads of mixed reads and writes when SSDs are under active garbage
collection. It causes little extra data writeback and increases the cache hit
rate.

gravitational field within it. This is mostly due to the Milky Way (MW) and
Andromeda (M31). We constrain their masses using distance and radial velocity
(RV) measurements of 32 LG galaxies. To do this, we follow the trajectories of
many simulated particles starting on a pure Hubble flow at redshift 9. For each
observed galaxy, we obtain a trajectory which today is at the same position.
Its final velocity is the model prediction for the velocity of that galaxy.
  Unlike previous simulations based on spherical symmetry, ours are
axisymmetric and include gravity from Centaurus A. We find the total LG mass is
${4.33^{+0.37}_{-0.32}\times{10}^{12}M_\odot}$, with $0.14 \pm 0.07$ of this
being in the MW. We approximately account for IC 342, M81, the Great Attractor
and the Large Magellanic Cloud.
  No plausible set of initial conditions yields a good match to the RVs of our
sample of LG galaxies. Observed RVs systematically exceed those predicted by
the best-fitting $\Lambda$CDM model, with a typical disagreement of
${45.1^{+7.0}_{-5.7}}$ km/s and a maximum of ${110 \pm 13}$ km/s for DDO 99.
Interactions between LG dwarf galaxies can't easily explain this.
  One possibility is a past close flyby of the MW and M31. This arises in some
modified gravity theories but not in $\Lambda$CDM. Gravitational slingshot
encounters of material in the LG with either of these massive fast-moving
galaxies could plausibly explain why some non-satellite LG galaxies are moving
away from us even faster than a pure Hubble flow.

of well-studied models, e.g., of Gross-Neveu and Thirring type, in a unified
framework. Within the limit of pointlike interactions, the RG flow of couplings
reveals a network of interacting fixed points, each of which defines a
universality class. A subset of fixed points are ""critical fixed points"" with
one RG relevant direction being candidates for critical points of second-order
phase transitions. Identifying invariant hyperplanes of the RG flow and
classifying their attractive/repulsive properties, we find evidence for
emergent higher chiral symmetries as a function of Nf. For the case of the
Thirring model, we discover a new critical flavor number that separates the RG
stable large-Nf regime from an intermediate-Nf regime in which
symmetry-breaking perturbations become RG relevant. This new critical flavor
number has to be distinguished from the chiral-critical flavor number, below
which the Thirring model is expected to allow spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking, and its existence offers a resolution to the discrepancy between
previous results obtained in the continuum and the lattice Thirring models.
Moreover, we find indications for a new feature of universality: details of the
critical behavior can depend on additional ""spectator symmetries"" that remain
intact across the phase transition. Implications for the physics of interacting
fermions on the honeycomb lattice, for which our theory space provides a simple

Ebb uses a three-layer architecture to separate (1) simulation code, (2)
definition of data structures for geometric domains, and (3) runtimes
supporting parallel architectures. Different geometric domains are implemented
as libraries that use a common, unified, relational data model. By structuring
the simulation framework in this way, programmers implementing simulations can
focus on the physics and algorithms for each simulation without worrying about
their implementation on parallel computers. Because the geometric domain
libraries are all implemented using a common runtime based on relations, new
geometric domains can be added as needed, without specifying the details of

expand the runtime's interface.

(self-reinforcing) feedback model which couples a macroscopic system parameter
(the interest rate), a microscopic parameter that measures the distribution of
the states of the individual agents (the number of firms in financial
difficulty) and a peer-to-peer network effect (contagion across supply chain
financing). In this model, each financial agent is characterized by its
resilience to the interest rate. Above a certain rate the interest due on the
firm's financial costs exceeds its earnings and the firm becomes susceptible to
failure (ponzi). For the interest rate levels under a certain threshold level,
the firm loans are smaller then its earnings and the firm becomes 'hedge.' In
this paper, we fit the historical data (2002-2009) on interest rate data into
our model, in order to predict the number of the ponzi firms. We compare the
prediction with the data taken from a large panel of Italian firms over a
period of 9 years. We then use trade credit linkages to discuss the connection
between the ponzi density and the network percolation.
  We find that the 'top-down'-'bottom-up' positive feedback loop accounts for
most of the Minsky crisis accelerator dynamics. The peer-to-peer ponzi
companies contagion becomes significant only in the last stage of the crisis
when the ponzi density is above a critical value. Moreover the ponzi contagion
is limited only to the companies that were not dynamic enough to substitute
their distressed clients with new ones. In this respect the data support a view
in which the success of the economy depends on substituting the static
'supply-network' picture with an interacting dynamic agents one.

attracting both scientific and technological attention owing to its intriguing
underlying physics and unique applications for high-speed electronics. The
materials system exhibiting resonant tunnelling, however, has been largely
limited to the conventional semiconductors, partially due to their excellent
crystalline quality. Here we show that a deliberately designed transition metal
oxide superlattice exhibits a resonant tunnelling behaviour with a clear
negative differential resistance. The tunnelling occurred through an atomically
thin, lanthanum {\delta}-doped SrTiO3 layer, and the negative differential
resistance was realized on top of the bipolar resistance switching typically
observed for perovskite oxide junctions. This combined process resulted in an
extremely large resistance ratio (~10^5) between the high and low-resistance
states. The unprecedentedly large control found in atomically thin
{\delta}-doped oxide superlattices can open a door to novel oxide-based
high-frequency logic devices.

hoc} network of $N$~timepieces. Clocks naturally drift away from being
synchronized because of many physical factors. The manual way of clock
synchronization suffers from an inherrent propagation of the so called ""clock
drift"" due to ""word-of-mouth effect."" The current standard way of automated
clock synchronization is either via radio band transmission of the global clock
or via the software-based Network Time Protocol (NTP). Synchronization via
radio band transmission suffers from the wave transmission delay, while the
client-server-based NTP does not scale to increased number of clients as well
as to unforeseen server overload conditions (e.g., flash crowd and time-of-day
effects). Further, the trivial running time of NTP for synchronizing an
$N$-node network, where each node is a clock and the NTP server follows a
single-port communication model, is~$\bigO(N)$. We introduce in this paper a
$\bigO(\log N)$ time for synchronizing the clocks in exchange for an increase
of $\bigO(N)$ in space complexity, though through creative ""tweaking,"" we later
reduced the space requirement to~$\bigO(1)$. Our graph-theoretic protocol
assumes that the network is $\K_N$, while the subset of clocks are in an
embedded circulant graph $\C_{n<N}^q$ with $q$~jumps and clock information is
communicated through circular shifts within the $\C_{n<N}^q$. All $N$~nodes
communicate via a single-port duplex channel model. Theoretically, this
synchronization protocol allows for $N(\log N)^{-1} - 1$ more synchronizations
than the client-server-based one. Empirically through statistically replicated
multi-agent-based microsimulation runs, our protocol allows at most 80\% of the
clocks synchronized compared to the current protocol which only allows up to
30\% after some steady-state time.

stability can only be answered in a statistical sense, for instance, based on
numerical ensemble integrations of nearby orbits. Destabilization of the inner
planets, leading to close encounters and/or collisions can be initiated through
a large increase in Mercury's eccentricity, with a currently assumed likelihood
of ~1%. However, little is known at present about the robustness of this
number. Here I report ensemble integrations of the full equations of motion of
the eight planets and Pluto over 5 Gyr, including contributions from general
relativity. The results show that different numerical algorithms lead to
statistically different results for the evolution of Mercury's eccentricity
(eM). For instance, starting at present initial conditions (eM ~= 0.21),
Mercury's maximum eccentricity achieved over 5 Gyr is on average significantly
higher in symplectic ensemble integrations using heliocentricthan Jacobi
coordinates and stricter error control. In contrast, starting at a possible
future configuration (eM ~= 0.53), Mercury's maximum eccentricity achieved over
the subsequent 500 Myr is on average significantly lower using heliocentric
than Jacobi coordinates. For example, the probability for eM to increase beyond
0.53 over 500 Myr is >90% (Jacobi) vs. only 40-55% (heliocentric). This poses a
dilemma as the physical evolution of the real system - and its probabilistic
behavior - cannot depend on the coordinate system or numerical algorithm chosen
to describe it. Some tests of the numerical algorithms suggest that symplectic

  Noise Statistics",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using state-space representation, mobile object positioning problems can be
described as dynamic systems, with the state representing the unknown location
and the observations being the information gathered from the location sensors.
For linear dynamic systems with Gaussian noise, the Kalman filter provides the
Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) state estimation by tracking the posterior.
Hence, by approximating non-Gaussian noise distributions with Gaussian Mixtures
(GM), a bank of Kalman filters or Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF), can provide the
MMSE state estimation. However, the MMSE itself is not analytically tractable.
Moreover, the general analytic bounds proposed in the literature are not
tractable for GM noise statistics. Hence, in this work, we evaluate the MMSE of
linear dynamic systems with GM noise statistics and propose its analytic lower
and upper bounds. We provide two analytic upper bounds which are the
Mean-Square Errors (MSE) of implementable filters, and we show that based on
the shape of the GM noise distributions, the tighter upper bound can be
selected. We also show that for highly multimodal GM noise distributions, the
bounds and the MMSE converge. Simulation results support the validity of the
proposed bounds and their behavior in limits.

scaled by the number of constituent quarks. The NCQ-scaled $\Omega/\phi$ ratios
show a suppression of strange quark production in central collisions at 11.5

adapted to faint objects and/or broad spectral features (e.g., dust continuum,
molecular bands), high-resolution observations allow more accurate measurements
of narrow features (e.g., ionic emission lines) as well as a better sampling of
the spectral profile of various features. Given the narrow aperture of the two
high-resolution modules, cosmic ray hits and spurious features usually plague
the spectra. Our pipeline is designed to minimize these effects through various
improvements. A super sampled point-spread function was created in order to
enable the optimal extraction in addition to the full aperture extraction. The
pipeline selects the best extraction method based on the spatial extent of the
object. For unresolved sources, the optimal extraction provides a significant
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over a full aperture extraction. We have

representation of $B_{2n}$ in terms of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(2n)$.
The modified Bernoulli numbers were recently generalized to Zagier polynomials
$B_{n}^{*}(x)$. For $0<x<1$, an exact formula for $B_{2n}^{*}(x)$ involving
infinite series of Bessel function of the second kind and Chebyshev

deduced as a limiting case of it. These formulas are reminiscent of the Fourier

objective function at the optimizer of the previous bound. We show that this
touching constraint is unnecessary and overly restrictive. We generalize MM by
relaxing this constraint, and propose a new optimization framework, named
Generalized Majorization-Minimization (G-MM), that is more flexible. For

Chern-Simons-matter theories in three dimensions. We consider a circular or
linear quiver with Chern-Simons levels $k$, $-k$ and $0$, and focus on loops
preserving one of the two $SU(2)$ subgroups of the $R$-symmetry. In the cases
with no vanishing Chern-Simons levels, we find a pair of Wilson loops for each
pair of adjacent nodes on the quiver connected by a hypermultiplet (nodes
connected by twisted hypermultiplets have Wilson loops preserving another set
of supercharges). We expect this classical pairwise degeneracy to be lifted by
quantum corrections. In the case with nodes with vanishing Chern-Simons terms
connected by twisted hypermultiplets, we find that the usual $1/4$ BPS Wilson
loops are automatically enlarged to $1/2$ BPS, as happens also in 3-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory. When the nodes with vanishing Chern-Simons levels are
connected by untwisted hypermultiplets, we do not find any Wilson loops
coupling to those nodes which are classically invariant. Rather, we find
several loops whose supersymmetry variation, while non zero, vanishes in any
correlation function, so is weakly zero. We expect only one linear combination
of those Wilson loops to remain BPS when quantum corrections are included. We
analyze the M-theory duals of those Wilson loops and comment on their
degeneracy. We also show that these Wilson loops are cohomologically equivalent
to certain $1/4$ BPS Wilson loops whose expectation value can be evaluated by
the appropriate localized matrix model.

general basis, e.g., Fourier basis. In this paper, we prove that the range
space of an $m\times n$ matrix with rank $r$ can be exactly recovered from few

samples are both as high as $O(\min\{m,n\}/\log^3 (m+n))$. Our model covers
previous ones as special cases, and robust MC can recover the intrinsic matrix
with a higher rank. Moreover, we suggest a universal choice of the
regularization parameter, which is $\lambda=1/\sqrt{\log n}$. By our
$\ell_{2,1}$ filtering algorithm, which has theoretical guarantees, we can
further reduce the computational cost of our model. As an application, we also

  revised version of 28 May 2015",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charge-state-resolved ion energy-time-distributions of pulsed Cu arc plasma
were obtained by using direct (time dependent) acquisition of the ion detection
signal from a commercial ion mass-per-charge and energy-per-charge analyzer. We
find a shift of energies of Cu2+, Cu3+ and Cu4+ ions to lower values during the
first few hundred microseconds after arc ignition, which is evidence for
particle collisions in the plasma. The generation of Cu1+ ions in the later
part of the pulse, measured by the increase of Cu1+ signal intensity and an
associated slight reduction of the mean charge state point to charge exchange
reactions between ions and neutrals. At the very beginning of the pulse, when
the plasma expands into vacuum and the plasma potential strongly fluctuates,
ions with much higher energy (over 200 eV) were observed. Early in the pulse,
the ion energies observed are approximately proportional to the ion charge
state, and we conclude that the acceleration mechanism is primarily based on
acceleration in an electric field. This field is directed away from the
cathode, indicative for a potential hump. Measurements by a floating probe
suggest that potential structures travel and ions moving in the traveling field
can gain high energies up to a few hundred electron-volt. Later in the pulse,
the approximate proportionality is lost, which is either related to increased
smearing out of different energies due to collisions with neutrals, and/or a
change of the acceleration character from electrostatic to ""gas-dynamic"", i.e.,
dominated by pressure gradient.

Brukner and Zeilinger proposed the concept of an operationally invariant
measure based on measurement statistics. Their measure of information is
calculated with probabilities generated in a complete set of mutually
complementary observations. This approach was later criticized for several
reasons. We show that some critical points can be overcome by means of natural
extension or reformulation of the Brukner-Zeilinger approach. In particular,
this approach is connected with symmetric informationally complete
measurements. The ""total information"" of Brukner and Zeilinger can further be
treated in the context of mutually unbiased measurements as well as general
symmetric informationally complete measurements. The Brukner-Zeilinger measure
of information is also examined in the case of detection inefficiencies. It is
shown to be decreasing under the action of bistochastic maps. The
Brukner-Zeilinger total information can be used for estimating the map norm of
quantum operations.

role of the electrically attained anisotropy was further revealed by the
digitized appearance of the TA mode, in clear contrast to the monotonic LA

signals such as MEG or EEG signals, that accounts for the inter-trial
variability, suitable for corresponding binary classification problems. An
important constraint is that the model be simple enough to handle small size
and unbalanced datasets, as often encountered in BCI type experiments.
Approach. The method involves linear mixed effects statistical model, wavelet
transform and spatial filtering, and aims at the characterization of localized
discriminant features in multi-sensor signals. After discrete wavelet transform
and spatial filtering, a projection onto the relevant wavelet and spatial
channels subspaces is used for dimension reduction. The projected signals are
then decomposed as the sum of a signal of interest (i.e. discriminant) and
background noise, using a very simple Gaussian linear mixed model. Main
results. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, the corresponding parameter
estimation problem is simplified. Robust estimates of class-covariance matrices
are obtained from small sample sizes and an effective Bayes plug-in classifier
is derived. The approach is applied to the detection of error potentials in
multichannel EEG data, in a very unbalanced situation (detection of rare
events). Classification results prove the relevance of the proposed approach in
such a context. Significance. The combination of linear mixed model, wavelet
transform and spatial filtering for EEG classification is, to the best of our
knowledge, an original approach, which is proven to be effective. This paper
improves on earlier results on similar problems, and the three main ingredients
all play an important role.

Specifically, we simulate realistic lens systems as imaged by the Hubble Space

the performance of these pointed observations with that of images taken by the
Euclid (VIS), Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and Large Synoptic

the slope $\gamma'$ of the total mass density profile $\rho_{tot}\propto
r^{-\gamma'}$ for the main deflector can be measured. Ideally, we require that
the statistical error on $\gamma'$ be less than 0.02, such that it is
subdominant to other sources of random and systematic uncertainties. We find
that survey data will likely have sufficient depth and resolution to meet the
target only for the brighter gravitational lens systems, comparable to those
discovered by the SDSS survey. For fainter systems, that will be discovered by
current and future surveys, targeted follow-up will be required. However, the

scenarios where the ratio of the channel coherence time to the number of users

the number of users per unit coverage area cannot grow freely while user
mobility is low, as in indoor networks. Another important scenario is when the
service provider is interested in maximizing the sum rate over a fixed,
selected number of users rather than the sum rate over all users in the cell. A
sum-rate comparison analysis shows that in such scenarios less aggressive reuse
of pilots involving allocation of additional pilots for interfering users
yields significant performance advantage relative to the case where all cells
reuse the same pilot set. For a given ratio of the normalized coherence time
interval to the number of users per cell, the optimal pilot assignment strategy
is revealed via a closed-form solution and the resulting net sum-rate is

functions with coefficients modeled by spatiotemporal random fields. Those
fields are given by correlated Gaussian random fields in space and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in time. The resulting system of equations
consists of a stochastic differential equation for each random parameter
coupled to the hyperbolic conservation law. We define an appropriate solution
concept in his setting and analyze errors and convergence of discretization
methods. A novel discretization framework, based on Monte Carlo Finite Volume
methods, is presented for the robust computation of moments of solutions to
those random hyperbolic partial differential equations. We showcase the
approach on two examples which appear in applications: The magnetic induction
equation and linear acoustics, both with a spatiotemporal random background
velocity field.

clarify the finite density corrections to the effective potential of a scalar

that the maximum temperature of the Universe may be at most electroweak scale

that the electroweak symmetry may be marginally restored. In addition, it is
noticeable that the dark matter may not be produced from thermal plasma in such
a low reheating scenario, since the maximum temperature can be smaller than the
conventional estimation by five orders of magnitude. We also give implications

We mainly address the problem of estimating causal effects from observational
data. For example, one can think of estimating the effect of single or multiple
gene knockouts from wild-type gene expression data, that is, from gene
expression measurements that were obtained without doing any gene knockout
experiments.
  We assume that the observational data are generated from a causal structure
that can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). First, we discuss
estimation of causal effects when the underlying causal DAG is known. In
large-scale networks, however, the causal DAG is often unknown. Next, we
therefore discuss causal structure learning, that is, learning information
about the causal structure from observational data. We then combine these two
parts and discuss methods to estimate (bounds on) causal effects from
observational data when the causal structure is unknown. We also illustrate
this method on a yeast gene expression data set. We close by mentioning several
extensions of the discussed work.

of magnetoelectric (ME) phenomena deals with the fundamental problem of the
relationship between electric and magnetic fields. Despite a formal resemblance
between the two notions, they concern effects of different natures. In general,
ME coupling effects manifest in numerous macroscopic phenomena in solids with
space and time symmetry breakings. Recently it was shown that the near fields
in the proximity of a small ferrite particle with magnetic dipolar mode (MDM)
oscillations have the space and time symmetry breakings and topological
properties of these fields are different from topological properties of the
free space electromagnetic (EM) fields. Such MDM originated fields, called
magnetoelectric (ME) fields, carry both spin and orbital angular momentums.
They are characterized by power flow vortices and non zero helicity. In this
paper, we report on observation of the topological ME effects in far field
microwave radiation based on a small microwave antenna with a MDM ferrite
resonator. We show that the microwave far-field radiation can be manifested
with a torsion structure where an angle between the electric and magnetic field
vectors varies. We discuss the question on observation of the regions of
localized ME energy in far field microwave radiation.

experiments leads to a preference of the leptonic CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$ in
the range between $\pi$ and $2\pi$. We study the statistical significance of
this hint by performing a Monte Carlo simulation of the relevant data. We find
that the distribution of the standard test statistic used to derive confidence
intervals for $\delta_{\rm CP}$ is highly non-Gaussian and depends on the
unknown true values of $\theta_{23}$ and the neutrino mass ordering. Values of
$\delta_{\rm CP}$ around $\pi/2$ are disfavored at between $2\sigma$ and
$3\sigma$, depending on the unknown true values of $\theta_{23}$ and the mass
ordering. Typically the standard $\chi^2$ approximation leads to over-coverage
of the confidence intervals for $\delta_{\rm CP}$. For the 2-dimensional
confidence region in the ($\delta_{\rm CP},\theta_{23}$) plane the usual
$\chi^2$ approximation is better justified. The 2-dimensional region does not
include the value $\delta_{\rm CP} = \pi/2$ up to the 86.3\% (89.2\%)~CL
assuming a true normal (inverted) mass ordering. Furthermore, we study the
sensitivity to $\delta_{\rm CP}$ and $\theta_{23}$ of an increased exposure of
the T2K experiment, roughly a factor 12 larger than the current exposure and
including also anti-neutrino data. Also in this case deviations from
Gaussianity may be significant, especially if the mass ordering is unknown.

driving the evolution of star-planet and planet-moon systems. Several
signatures of its action are observed in planetary systems thanks to their
orbital architecture and the rotational state of their components. Tidal
dissipation inside the fluid layers of celestial bodies are intrinsically
linked to the dynamics and the physical properties of the latter. This complex
dependence must be characterized. We compute the tidal kinetic energy
dissipated by viscous friction and thermal diffusion in a rotating local fluid
Cartesian section of a star/planet/moon submitted to a periodic tidal forcing.
The properties of tidal gravito-inertial waves excited by the perturbation are
derived analytically as explicit functions of the tidal frequency and local
fluid parameters (i.e. the rotation, the buoyancy frequency characterizing the
entropy stratification, viscous and thermal diffusivities) for periodic normal
modes. The sensitivity of the resulting possibly highly resonant dissipation
frequency-spectra to a control parameter of the system is either important or
negligible depending on the position in the regime diagram relevant for
planetary and stellar interiors. For corresponding asymptotic behaviors of
tidal gravito-inertial waves dissipated by viscous friction and thermal
diffusion, scaling laws for the frequencies, number, width, height and contrast
with the non-resonant background of resonances are derived to quantify these
variations. We characterize the strong impact of the internal physics and
dynamics of fluid planetary layers and stars on the dissipation of tidal
kinetic energy in their bulk. We point out the key control parameters that
really play a role and demonstrate how it is now necessary to develop ab-initio
modeling for tidal dissipation in celestial bodies.

together and why only some of the loops oscillate.
  Methods: A time sequence of SDO/AIA 171 \r{A} images is analysed to identify
positions of coronal loops following the onset of M6.4 flare
SOL2012-03-09T03:53. We focus on five loops in particular, all of which
contract during the flare, with three of them oscillating as well. A simple
model is then developed for contraction and oscillation of a coronal loop.
  Results: We propose that coronal loop contractions and oscillations can occur
in a single response to removal of magnetic energy from the corona. Our model
reproduces the various types of loop motion observed and explains why the
highest loops oscillate during their contraction while no oscillation is
detected for the shortest contracting loops. The proposed framework suggests
that loop motions can be used as a diagnostic for the removal of coronal
magnetic energy by flares, while rapid decrease of coronal magnetic energy is a
newly-identified excitation mechanism for transverse loop oscillations.

regular empirical risk minimization (ERM), it aims to learn a classifier with a
low error rate, and at the same time, for the predictions of the classifier to
be independent of sensitive features, such as gender, religion, race, and
ethnicity. Existing methods can achieve low dependencies on given samples, but
this is not guaranteed on unseen samples. The existing fairness-aware learning
algorithms employ different dependency measures, and each algorithm is
specifically designed for a particular one. Such diversity makes it difficult
to theoretically analyze and compare them. In this paper, we propose a general
framework for fairness-aware learning that uses f-divergences and that covers
most of the dependency measures employed in the existing methods. We introduce
a way to estimate the f-divergences that allows us to give a unified analysis
for the upper bound of the estimation error; this bound is tighter than that of
the existing convergence rate analysis of the divergence estimation. With our
divergence estimate, we propose a fairness-aware learning algorithm, and
perform a theoretical analysis of its generalization error. Our analysis
reveals that, under mild assumptions and even with enforcement of fairness, the
generalization error of our method is $O(\sqrt{1/n})$, which is the same as
that of the regular ERM. In addition, and more importantly, we show that, for
any f-divergence, the upper bound of the estimation error of the divergence is
$O(\sqrt{1/n})$. This indicates that our fairness-aware learning algorithm
guarantees low dependencies on unseen samples for any dependency measure
represented by an f-divergence.

redundancy spread over storage servers across the Internet. Network coding (NC)
has been widely studied in DSS because it can improve the reliability with low
repair time. To maintain reliability, an unavailable storage server should be
firstly replaced by a new server, named new comer. Then, multiple storage
servers, called providers, should be selected from surviving servers and send
their coded data through the Internet to the new comer for regenerating the
lost data. Therefore, in a large-scale DSS, provider selection and data routing
during the regeneration phase have great impact on the performance of
regeneration time. In this paper, we investigate a problem of optimal provider
selection and data routing for minimizing the regeneration time in the DSS with
NC. Specifically, we first define the problem in the DSS with NC. For the case
that the providers are given, we model the problem as a mathematical
programming. Based on the mathematical programming, we then formulate the
optimal provider selection and data routing problem as an integer linear

exhibit inverse first ionisation potential effect in both cases. An analysis of
He-like triplets yields a range of coronal electron densities ~10^10-10^13

the Universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion. This
phase, one of the most important and challenging current problems in cosmology,
represents a new imbalance in the governing gravitational equations.
Historically, physics has addressed such imbalances by either identifying
sources that were previously unaccounted for, or by altering the gravitational
theory. Several candidates, responsible for this expansion, have been proposed
in the literature, in particular, dark energy models and modified gravity
models, amongst others. Outstanding questions are related to the nature of this
so-called ""dark energy"" that is driving this acceleration, and whether it is
due to the vacuum energy or a dynamical field. On the other hand, the late-time
cosmic acceleration may be due to modifications of General Relativity. In this
work we explore a generalised modified gravity theory, namely $f(R,\phi,X)$
gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $\phi$ is a scalar field, and $X$ is a
kinetic term. This theory contains a wide range of dark energy and modified
gravity models. We considered specific models and applications to the late-time

NP-hard problems. Empirically, preprocessing is highly successful in practice,
for example in state-of-the-art ILP-solvers like CPLEX. Motivated by this,
previous work studied the existence of kernelizations for ILP related problems,
e.g., for testing feasibility of Ax <= b. In contrast to the observed success
of CPLEX, however, the results were largely negative. Intuitively, practical
instances have far more useful structure than the worst-case instances used to
prove these lower bounds.
  In the present paper, we study the effect that subsystems with (Gaifman graph
of) bounded treewidth or totally unimodularity have on the kernelizability of
the ILP feasibility problem. We show that, on the positive side, if these
subsystems have a small number of variables on which they interact with the
remaining instance, then we can efficiently replace them by smaller subsystems
of size polynomial in the domain without changing feasibility. Thus, if large
parts of an instance consist of such subsystems, then this yields a substantial
size reduction. We complement this by proving that relaxations to the
considered structures, e.g., larger boundaries of the subsystems, allow
worst-case lower bounds against kernelization. Thus, these relaxed structures
can be used to build instance families that cannot be efficiently reduced, by
any approach.

for an associated autonomous system where parameters are fixed. In particular,
we show that there is a unique local pullback point attractor associated with
each linearly stable equilibrium for the past limit. If there is a smooth
stable branch of equilibria over the range of values of the parameter shift,
the pullback attractor will remain close to (track) this branch for small
enough rates, though larger rates may lead to rate-induced tipping. More
generally, we show that one can track certain stable paths that go along
several stable branches by pseudo-orbits of the system, for small enough rates.
For these local pullback point attractors, we define notions of
bifurcation-induced and irreversible rate-induced tipping of the non-autonomous
system. In one-dimension, we give a number of sufficient conditions for the
presence or absence of rate-induced tipping, and we discuss some applications

one order of magnitude than those of the ones currently in orbit. Its
wide-field imaging capability, featuring a large instantaneous field-of-view
($60^\circ \times60^\circ$, $\sim1.1$sr), is achieved by using established
technology of micro-pore (MPO) lobster-eye optics, thereby offering
unprecedentedly high sensitivity and large Grasp. To complement this powerful
monitoring ability, it also carries a narrow-field, sensitive follow-up X-ray
telescope based on the same MPO technology to perform follow-up observations of
newly-discovered transients. Public transient alerts will be downlinked
rapidly, so as to trigger multi-wavelength follow-up observations from the
world-wide community. Over three of its 97-minute orbits almost the entire
night sky will be sampled, with cadences ranging from 5 to 25 times per day.
The scientific objectives of the mission are: to discover otherwise quiescent
black holes over all astrophysical mass scales by detecting their rare X-ray
transient flares, particularly tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes
at galactic centers; to detect and precisely locate the electromagnetic sources
of gravitational-wave transients; to carry out systematic surveys of X-ray

ground-state densities in density-functional theory (i.e., the minimizers of
the Hohenberg--Kohn (HK) variation principle) is studied within the framework
of convex conjugation, in a generic setting covering molecular systems,
solid-state systems, and more. Having introduced admissible density functionals
as functionals that produce the exact ground ground-state energy for a given
external potential by minimizing over densities in the HK variation principle,
necessary sufficient conditions on such functionals are established to ensure
that the RR ground-state densities and the HK ground-state densities are
identical. We apply the results to molecular systems in the BO-approximation.
For any given potential $v \in L^{3/2}(\mathbb{R}^3) +
L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the
mixed ground-state densities of the RR variation principle and the mixed
ground-state densities of the HK variation principle when the Lieb
density-matrix constrained-search universal density functional is taken as the
admissible functional. A similar one-to-one correspondence is established
between the pure ground-state densities of the RR variation principle and the
pure ground-state densities obtained using the HK variation principle with the
Levy--Lieb pure-state constrained-search functional. In other words, all
physical ground-state densities (pure or mixed) are recovered with these
functionals and no false densities (i.e., minimizing densities that are not
physical) exist. The importance of topology (i.e., choice of Banach space of
densities and potentials) is emphasized and illustrated. The relevance of these

disk-based processing to modern in-memory processing. However, little effort
has been devoted at enhancing performance at micro-architecture level. This
paper characterizes the performance of in-memory data analytics using Apache
Spark framework. We use a single node NUMA machine and identify the bottlenecks
hampering the scalability of workloads. We also quantify the inefficiencies at
micro-architecture level for various data analysis workloads. Through empirical
evaluation, we show that spark workloads do not scale linearly beyond twelve
threads, due to work time inflation and thread level load imbalance. Further,
at the micro-architecture level, we observe memory bound latency to be the
major cause of work time inflation.

constraints. We prove existence and residual and objective convergence results
for the proposed methods and provide computer simulation results in a highly
realistic six-compartment geometry-adapted hexahedral head model. For
discretization of the proposed minimization problem the finite element method
is employed and the existence of at least one minimizer to the discretized
optimization problem is shown. For numerical solution of the corresponding
discretized problem we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers
and comprehensively examine the cortical current flow field with regard to
focality, target intensity and orientation. The numerical results reveal that
the optimized current flow fields show significantly higher focality and, in
most cases, higher directional agreement to the target vector in comparison to
standard bipolar electrode montages.

magnetic field-tunable metacomposite feature has been identified in the dense
continuous hybrid composite confirmed by the transmission windows in the
frequency band of 1 to 3.5 GHz. The complex magnetically tuned
redshift-blueshift evolution of the transmission window is reasoned to result
from the competition between the dynamic wire-wire interaction and the
ferromagnetic resonance of Fe-based wires. Increasing Co-based inter-wire
spacing to 10 mm in the continuous hybrid composites, a remarkable dual-band
transmission window in the 1.5-3.5 GHz and 9-17 GHz is respectively induced by
the ferromagnetic resonance of Fe-based wires and the magnetic resonance
arising between Fe-Co wire couples. The hybridization of parallel Fe-based and
short-cut Co-based wires in the polymer composite leads to a significant
enhancement of the transmission window in the frequency band of 1 to 6 GHz due
to the band-stop nature of Co-based wires. The advanced hybridized microwire
metacomposites are arguably demonstrated to be particularly attractive for
microwave cloaking and radio frequency barcoding applications.

condition for a generic (full-rank) target state to be frustration-free

Markovian dynamics that achieve stabilization. If the target state is not
full-rank, we establish sufficiency under an additional condition, which is
naturally motivated by consistency with pure-state stabilization results yet

a large class of graph product states (including arbitrary thermal graph

stabilizable relative to natural quasi-locality constraints. Likewise, we
provide explicit examples of non-commuting Gibbs states and non-trivially

their spectrum is encoded in exact quantization conditions, and turns out to be

  Active Galactic Nuclei in the Low-mass Regime","accepted for publication in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) found a statistical inverse
linear scaling between the X-ray normalized excess variance $\sigma_{\rm
rms}^2$ (variability amplitude) and the black hole mass spanning over $M_{\rm
BH}=10^6- 10^9\ M_{\odot}$. Being suggested to have a small scatter, this
scaling relation may provide a novel method to estimate the black hole mass of
AGN. However, a question arises as to whether this relation can be extended to
the low-mass regime below $\sim10^6\ M_{\odot}$. If confirmed, it would provide
an efficient tool to search for AGN with low-mass black holes using X-ray
variability. This paper presents a study of the X-ray excess variances for a
sample of AGN with black hole masses in the range of $10^5- 10^6\ M_{\odot}$
observed with {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it ROSAT}, including data both from the
archives and from newly preformed observations. It is found that the relation
is no longer a simple extrapolation of the linear scaling; instead, the
relation starts to flatten at $\sim10^6\ M_{\odot}$ toward lower masses. Our
result is consistent with the recent finding of \citet{L15}. Such a flattening
of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_{\rm rms}^2$ relation is actually expected from the
shape of the power spectrum density of AGN, whose break frequency is inversely
scaled with the mass of black holes.

zero-range process with renormalized hopping rates, which are space dependent

profiles in the steady state of the conditioned dynamics, and, under generic
conditions on the jump rates of the unconditioned ZRP, to an intriguing
supercritical bulk region where condensates can grow. These results provide a
microscopic perspective on macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) for the weakly
asymmetric case: It turns out that the predictions of MFT remain valid in the
non-rigorous limit of finite asymmetry. In addition, the microscopic results
yield the correct scaling factor for the asymmetry that MFT cannot predict.

transition to the crystal. When a liquid is cooled to form a glass, however, no
noticeable structural change marks the glass transition. Indeed, characteristic
features of glassy dynamics that appear below an onset temperature, T_0, are
qualitatively captured by mean field theory, which assumes uniform local
structure at all temperatures. Even studies of more realistic systems have
found only weak correlations between structure and dynamics. This raises the
question: is structure important to glassy dynamics in three dimensions? Here,
we answer this question affirmatively by using machine learning methods to
identify a new field, that we call softness, which characterizes local
structure and is strongly correlated with rearrangement dynamics. We find that
the onset of glassy dynamics at T_0 is marked by the onset of correlations
between softness (i.e. structure) and dynamics. Moreover, we use softness to
construct a simple model of slow glassy relaxation that is in excellent
agreement with our simulation results, showing that a theory of the evolution
of softness in time would constitute a theory of glassy dynamics.

the context of bipartite graphs. We show that, unlike MWIS, the MIVC (and

the MWBIS problem admits a $\frac{1}{2}$-factor approximation algorithm in the

involves sampling a spanning tree from the solution the standard LP relaxation
of the TSP, subject to the condition that each edge is sampled with probability
at most its value in the LP relaxation. One then runs Christofides' algorithm
on the tree by computing a minimum-cost matching on the odd-degree vertices in
the tree, and shortcutting the resulting Eulerian graph to a tour. In this
paper we perform an experimental evaluation of the Best-of-Many Christofides'
algorithm to see if there are empirical reasons to believe its performance is
better than that of Christofides' algorithm. Furthermore, several different
sampling schemes have been proposed; we implement several different schemes to
determine which ones might be the most promising for obtaining improved
performance guarantees over that of Christofides' algorithm. In our
experiments, all of the implemented methods perform significantly better than
the Christofides' algorithm; an algorithm that samples from a maximum entropy
distribution over spanning trees seems to be particularly good, though there
are others that perform almost as well.

the author studied the quality of approximation provided by the finite sums

  The main result of this paper is the following statement: given a sequence of
positive real numbers $(\omega_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty},$ which satisfy
$\lim_{n\to\infty} \omega_{n}=\infty$, then for Lebesgue almost every
$\beta\in(1.497\ldots,2)$ the set $W_{\beta}(\omega_{n}\cdot 2^{-n})$ is of

further development of this material for photovoltaics (PV) is to reliably
synthesize films with carrier density less than or equal to 10^17
electrons/cm^3. In this work, we perform a systematic annealing study on
compositionally-graded Zn-Sn-N thin films to determine the effects on carrier
density and transport of such post-growth treatment. We find that annealing up
to 6 hr under an activated nitrogen atmosphere results in a reduction in
carrier density by ~80% for zinc-rich films, and by ~50% for stoichiometric
films. However, we also find that annealing reduces mobility as a function of
increasing annealing time. This result suggests that initial film disorder
hampers the benefits to film quality that should have been gained through
annealing. This finding highlights that carefully managed initial growth
conditions will be necessary to obtain PV-quality ZnSnN2 absorber films.

Their host galaxies therefore represent a unique class of objects tracing star
formation across the observable Universe. Indeed, recently accumulated evidence
shows that GRB hosts do not differ substantially from general population of
galaxies at high (z > 2) redshifts. However, it has been long recognised that
the properties of z < 1.5 hosts, compared to general star-forming population,
are unusual. To better understand the reasons for the supposed difference in
LGRB hosts properties at z < 1.5, we obtained VLT/X- Shooter spectra of six
hosts lying in the redshift range of 0.8 < z < 1.3. Some of these hosts have
been observed before, yet we still lack well constrained information on their
characteristics such as metallicity, dust extinction and star formation rate.
We search for emission lines in the VLT/X-Shooter spectra of the hosts and
measure their fluxes. We perform a detailed analysis, estimating host average
extinction, star-formation rates, metallicities and electron densities where
possible. Measured quantities of our hosts are compared to a larger sample of
previously observed GRB hosts at z < 2. Star-formation rates and metallicities
are measured for all the hosts analyzed in this paper and metallicities are
well determined for 4 hosts. The mass-metallicity relation, the fundamental
metallicity relation and SFRs derived from our hosts occupy similar parameter
space as other host galaxies investigated so-far at the same redshift. We
therefore conclude that GRB hosts in our sample support the found discrepancy
between the properties of low-redshift GRB hosts and the general population of
star- forming galaxies.

components of living cells and tissues. The mechanical stability of networks
generally depends on the degree of connectivity: only when the average number
of connections between nodes exceeds the isostatic threshold are networks
stable (Maxwell, J. C., Philosophical Magazine 27, 294 (1864)). Upon increasing
the connectivity through this point, such networks undergo a mechanical phase
transition from a floppy to a rigid phase. However, even sub-isostatic networks
become rigid when subjected to sufficiently large deformations. To study this
strain-controlled transition, we perform a combination of computational
modeling of fibre networks and experiments on networks of type I collagen
fibers, which are crucial for the integrity of biological tissues. We show
theoretically that the development of rigidity is characterized by a
strain-controlled continuous phase transition with signatures of criticality.
Our experiments demonstrate mechanical properties consistent with our model,
including the predicted critical exponents. We show that the nonlinear
mechanics of collagen networks can be quantitatively captured by the
predictions of scaling theory for the strain-controlled critical behavior over
a wide range of network concentrations and strains up to failure of the
material.

hand, of the cold dark matter correlations and, on the other hand, of the

that the dark matter density fluctuations follow a local non-linear
transformation of the initial energy density perturbations. The N-pdf of the
galaxy number density fluctuations allows for an optimal estimation of the bias
parameter (e.g., via maximum-likelihood estimation, or Bayesian inference if
there exists any a priori information on the bias parameter), and of those
parameters defining the dark matter correlations, in particular its amplitude
($\sigma_8$). It also provides the proper framework to perform model selection
between two competitive hypotheses. The parameters estimation capabilities of
the N-pdf are proved by SDSS-like simulations (both ideal log-normal
simulations and mocks obtained from Las Damas simulations), showing that our
estimator is unbiased. We apply our formalism to the 7th release of the SDSS
main sample (for a volume-limited subset with absolute magnitudes $M_r \leq
-20$). We obtain $\hat{b} = 1.193 \pm 0.074$ and $\hat{\sigma_8} = 0.862 \pm

using the lattice formulation, and some new results are presented for critical
exponents, amplitudes and invariant correlation functions. Values for the
universal scaling dimensions are compared with other nonperturbative approaches
to gravity in four dimensions, and specifically to the conjectured value for
the universal critical exponent $\nu =1 /3$. It is found that the lattice
results are generally consistent with gravitational anti-screening, which would
imply a slow increase in the strength of the gravitational coupling with
distance, and here detailed estimates for exponents and amplitudes
characterizing this slow rise are presented. Furthermore, it is shown that in
the lattice approach (as for gauge theories) the quantum theory is highly
constrained, and eventually by virtue of scaling depends on a rather small set
of physical parameters. Arguments are given in support of the statement that
the fundamental reference scale for the growth of the gravitational coupling
$G$ with distance is represented by the observed scaled cosmological constant
$\lambda$, which in gravity acts as an effective nonperturbative infrared
cutoff. In the vacuum condensate picture a fundamental relationship emerges
between the scale characterizing the running of $G$ at large distances, the
macroscopic scale for the curvature as described by the observed cosmological
constant, and the behavior of invariant gravitational correlation functions at
large distances. Overall, the lattice results suggest that the infrared slow
growth of $G$ with distance should become observable only on very large
distance scales, comparable to $\lambda$. It is hoped that future high
precision satellite experiments will possibly come within reach of this small
quantum correction, as suggested by a vacuum condensate picture of quantum
gravity.

quantifies the correlations that can be turned into coherence, and how much
coherence can be extracted. We answer both questions, and illustrate its

general concept of enhancing coherence by modifying correlations.

intermediate in duration class, was suggested to be present in previous
catalogs, such as BATSE and $Swift$, based on statistical tests regarding a
mixture of two or three log-normal distributions of $T_{90}$. However, this
might possibly not be an adequate model. This paper investigates whether the
distributions of $\log T_{90}$ from BATSE, $Swift$, and $Fermi$ are described
better by a mixture of skewed distributions rather than standard Gaussians.
Mixtures of standard normal, skew-normal, sinh-arcsinh and alpha-skew-normal
distributions are fitted using a maximum likelihood method. The preferred model
is chosen based on the Akaike information criterion. It is found that mixtures
of two skew-normal or two sinh-arcsinh distributions are more likely to
describe the observed duration distribution of $Fermi$ than a mixture of three
standard Gaussians, and that mixtures of two sinh-arcsinh or two skew-normal
distributions are models competing with the conventional three-Gaussian in the
case of BATSE and $Swift$. Based on statistical reasoning, existence of a third
(intermediate) class of GRBs in $Fermi$ data is rejected, and it is shown that
other phenomenological models may describe the observed $Fermi$, BATSE, and

parachute system for Micro Air Vehicles, in particular focusing on verification
of the embedded software. We first introduce the overall solution including a
system level failure analysis, and then show how we minimized the influence of
faulty software. This paper demonstrates that with careful abstraction and
little overapproximation, the entire code running on a microprocessor can be
verified using bounded model checking, and that this is a useful approach for
resource-constrained embedded systems. he resulting Emergency Recovery System
is to our best knowledge the first of its kind that passed formal verification,
and furthermore is superior to all other existing solutions (including
commercially available ones) from an operational point of view.

very large datasets in a variety of fields. Often the analysis requires the
creation of low-rank approximations to the datasets leading to efficient

nonnegative, structured dictionaries using NMF applied to reordered pixels of
single, natural images. We reorder the pixels based on patches and present our
approach in general. We investigate our approach when using the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) and Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations (NMF) as low-rank
approximations. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Structural
Similarity Index (MSSIM) are used to evaluate the algorithm. We report that
while the SVD provides the best reconstructions, its dictionary of vectors lose
both the sign structure of the original image and details of localized image
content. In contrast, the dictionaries produced using NMF preserves the sign
structure of the original image matrix and offer a nonnegative, parts-based
dictionary.

  Reconstruction for X-Ray Imaging for Security Applications",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Three-dimensional x-ray CT image reconstruction in baggage scanning in
security applications is an important research field. The variety of materials
to be reconstructed is broader than medical x-ray imaging. Presence of high
attenuating materials such as metal may cause artifacts if analytical
reconstruction methods are used. Statistical modeling and the resultant
iterative algorithms are known to reduce these artifacts and present good
quantitative accuracy in estimates of linear attenuation coefficients. However,
iterative algorithms may require computations in order to achieve
quantitatively accurate results. For the case of baggage scanning, in order to
provide fast accurate inspection throughput, they must be accelerated
drastically. There are many approaches proposed in the literature to increase
speed of convergence. This paper presents a new method that estimates the
wavelet coefficients of the images in the discrete wavelet transform domain
instead of the image space itself. Initially, surrogate functions are created
around approximation coefficients only. As the iterations proceed, the wavelet
tree on which the updates are made is expanded based on a criterion and detail
coefficients at each level are updated and the tree is expanded this way. For
example, in the smooth regions of the image the detail coefficients are not
updated while the coefficients that represent the high-frequency component
around edges are being updated, thus saving time by focusing computations where
they are needed. This approach is implemented on real data from a SureScan (TM)
x1000 Explosive Detection System and compared to straightforward implementation
of the unregularized alternating minimization of O'Sullivan and Benac [1].

found to be at 30 users, exactly the mean class size in TUP-T. The 3D-AVLE
allows for recording of the learners' experiences which provides the learners a

in engineering sciences were conducted using the usual teaching aid
