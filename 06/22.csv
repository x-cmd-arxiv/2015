solution of the $ U(1)/Z_2 $ Dicke model studied by us previously.
  Here we point out that
  (1) The authors missed an important transformation relating the two parameter
regimes, so their separate discussions on the two regimes is redundant.
  (2) Both $ N=\infty $ classical limit and $ 1/N $ quantum fluctuations have
been achieved in two of our previously published papers. It is the $ 1/N $
quantum fluctuations which lead to the non-trivial new quantum phenomena. In
view of only a few $ N=2\sim 9 $ qubits inside a circuit QED microwave cavity,
they can be tested in near future experiments.
  (3) Several possible experimental implementations of the $ U(1)/Z_2 $ Dicke
model have been proposed before and recently experimentally realized.

key ingredient to obtain rigorous constraints on deviations from General
Relativity using large-scale structure observations. This paper provides the
first detailed comparison of the results of different ${\it N}$-body codes for
the $f(R)$, DGP, and Symmetron models, starting from the same initial
conditions. We find that the fractional deviation of the matter power spectrum
from $\Lambda$CDM agrees to better than $1\%$ up to $k \sim 5-10~h/{\rm Mpc}$
between the different codes. These codes are thus able to meet the stringent
accuracy requirements of upcoming observational surveys. All codes are also in
good agreement in their results for the velocity divergence power spectrum,
halo abundances and halo profiles. We also test the quasi-static limit, which
is employed in most modified gravity ${\it N}$-body codes, for the Symmetron
model for which the most significant non-static effects among the models
considered are expected. We conclude that this limit is a very good
approximation for all of the observables considered here.

and combinatorics. This paper adds a new concept, called 'bias', to the bridge.
This produces: (i) from a biased plane tree the construction of a sequence of
algebraic numbers, and (ii) a Galois invariant lattice structure on the set of
biased dessins. Bias brings these benefits by (i) using individual polynomials
instead of equivalence classes of polynomials, and (ii) applying properties of
covering spaces and the fundamental group. The new features give new
opportunities.
  At the 2014 SIGMAP conference the author spoke [1] on 'The decorated lattice
of biased dessins'. This decorated lattice $\mathcal{L}$ is combinatorially
defined, and its automorphism group contains the absolute Galois group
$\Gamma$, perhaps as an index 6 subgroup.
  This paper defines new families of invariants of dessins, although they
require further work to be understood and useful. For this, $\mathcal{L}$ is
vital. This paper relies on the the existing, unbiased, theory. Also, it only
sketches the construction of $\mathcal{L}$. In [2], [3] the author will remove
this dependency, develop the biased theory further, with a focus on $\Gamma$,
and make the theory more accessible.

amplification due to collisionless plasma instabilities. The collisionless
magnetohydrodynamic equations derived account for the pressure anisotropy that
leads, in specific conditions, to the firehose and mirror instabilities. We
study the time evolution of seed fields in turbulence under the influence of
such instabilities. An approximate analytical time evolution of magnetic field
is provided. The numerical simulations and the analytical predictions are
compared. We found that i) amplification of magnetic field was efficient in
firehose unstable turbulent regimes, but not in the mirror unstable models, ii)
the growth rate of the magnetic energy density is much faster than the
turbulent dynamo, iii) the efficient amplification occurs at small scales. The
analytical prediction for the correlation between the growth timescales with
pressure anisotropy ratio is confirmed by the numerical simulations. These
results reinforce the idea that pressure anisotropies - driven naturally in a
turbulent collisionless medium, e.g. the intergalactic medium -, could
efficiently amplify the magnetic field in the early Universe
(post-recombination era), previous to the collapse of the first large-scale
gravitational structures. This mechanism, though fast for the small scale
fields ($\sim$kpc scales), is however unable to provide relatively strong
magnetic fields at large scales. Other mechanisms that were not accounted here
(e.g., collisional turbulence once instabilities are quenched, velocity shear,
or gravitationally induced inflows of gas into galaxies and clusters) could
operate afterwards to build up large scale coherent field structures in the
long time evolution.

different forecasts is always sub-optimal. More specifically, it is not
consistent with any set of information about the future outcome even if the
individual forecasts are. Furthermore, weighted averaging does not behave as if
it collects information from the forecasters and hence needs to be extremized,

of optimizing the sky coverage of small-scale, suborbital experiments in order
to maximize the statistical significance of the detection of $r$. We show that
the optimized sky coverage is largely insensitive to the adopted approach at

mode-counting overestimates the detection significance by a factor $\sim1.17$

$\sim1.25$ as compared to the lossy pure pseudo-spectrum estimator. In a second

be sufficient to discriminate between large- and small-field models of

lattice QCD calculations were done using nine ensembles of gauge configurations
generated by the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical
flavors. These ensembles span three lattice spacings $a \approx 0.06, 0.09$ and
$0.12 $ fm and three quark masses corresponding to the pion masses $M_\pi

$\bar{\text{MS}}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The additional disconnected quark loop
contributions needed for the flavor-diagonal matrix elements are calculated
using a stochastic estimator employing the truncated solver method with the

it as an additional uncertainty in the flavor-diagonal charges. After a

algebras (DAHA) associates such objects to pairs of compatible reductive group
data. We show that DAAG/DAHA always admit a faithful action by automorphisms of
a finite index subgroup of the Artin group of type $A_{2}$, which descends to a
faithful outer action of a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ or
$PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. This was previously known only in some special cases and,
to the best of our knowledge, not even conjectured to hold in full generality.
  The structural intricacies of DAAG/DAHA are captured by the underlying
semisimple data and, to a large extent, by adjoint data; we prove our main
result by reduction to the adjoint case. Adjoint DAAG/DAHA correspond in a
natural way to affine Lie algebras, or more precisely to their affinized Weyl
groups, which are the semi-direct products $W\ltimes Q^{\vee}$ of the Weyl
group $W$ with the coroot lattice $Q^{\vee}$. We now describe our results for
the adjoint case in greater detail.
  We first give a new Coxeter-type presentation for adjoint DAAG as quotients
of the Coxeter braid groups associated to certain crystallographic diagrams
that we call double affine Coxeter diagrams. As a consequence we show that the
rank two Artin groups of type $A_{2},B_{2},G_{2}$ act by automorphisms on the
adjoint DAAG/DAHA associated to affine Lie algebras of twist $r=1,2,3$,
respectively. This extends a fundamental result of Cherednik for $r=1$.
  We show further that the above rank two Artin group action descends to an
outer action of congruence subgroup $\Gamma_{1}(r)$. In particular $\Gamma_{1}(
r) $ acts naturally on the set of isomorphism classes of representations of an
adjoint DAAG/DAHA of twist type $r$, giving rise to a projective representation
of $\Gamma_{1}( r) $ on the space of a $\Gamma_{1}( r) $-stable representation.

  Clustering",,,,,"stat.ML math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical clustering is a popular method for analyzing data which
associates a tree to a dataset. Hartigan consistency has been used extensively
as a framework to analyze such clustering algorithms from a statistical point
of view. Still, as we show in the paper, a tree which is Hartigan consistent
with a given density can look very different than the correct limit tree.
Specifically, Hartigan consistency permits two types of undesirable
configurations which we term over-segmentation and improper nesting. Moreover,
Hartigan consistency is a limit property and does not directly quantify
difference between trees.
  In this paper we identify two limit properties, separation and minimality,
which address both over-segmentation and improper nesting and together imply
(but are not implied by) Hartigan consistency. We proceed to introduce a merge
distortion metric between hierarchical clusterings and show that convergence in
our distance implies both separation and minimality. We also prove that uniform
separation and minimality imply convergence in the merge distortion metric.
Furthermore, we show that our merge distortion metric is stable under
perturbations of the density.
  Finally, we demonstrate applicability of these concepts by proving
convergence results for two clustering algorithms. First, we show convergence
(and hence separation and minimality) of the recent robust single linkage
algorithm of Chaudhuri and Dasgupta (2010). Second, we provide convergence
results on manifolds for topological split tree clustering.

with tailored numerical simulations, of the nearest, best resolved cluster cold
front in the sky, which lies 90 kpc (19 arcmin) to the north-west of M 87. The
northern part of the front appears the sharpest, with a width smaller than 2.5
kpc (1.5 Coulomb mean free paths; at 99 per cent confidence). Everywhere along
the front, the temperature discontinuity is narrower than 4-8 kpc and the
metallicity gradient is narrower than 6 kpc, indicating that diffusion,
conduction and mixing are suppressed across the interface. Such transport
processes can be naturally suppressed by magnetic fields aligned with the cold
front. Interestingly, comparison to magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicates
that in order to maintain the observed sharp density and temperature
discontinuities, conduction must also be suppressed along the magnetic field
lines. However, the northwestern part of the cold front is observed to have a
non-zero width. While other explanations are possible, the broadening is
consistent with the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) on
length-scales of a few kpc. Based on comparison with simulations, the presence
of KHI would imply that the effective viscosity of the intracluster medium is
suppressed by more than an order of magnitude with respect to the isotropic
Spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity. Underneath the cold front, we
observe quasi-linear features that are ~10 per cent brighter than the
surrounding gas and are separated by ~15 kpc from each other in projection.
Comparison to tailored numerical simulations suggests that the observed
phenomena may be due to the amplification of magnetic fields by gas sloshing in
wide layers below the cold front, where the magnetic pressure reaches ~5-10 per
cent of the thermal pressure, reducing the gas density between the bright
features.

rise to a convex variational problem defining our metric. Our first

mutations are usually observed as conferring a homozygous loss of function. The
gain-of-function mutations in EZH2 provide an obvious target for the
development of inhibitors with therapeutic potential. To counter the loss of
functional MLL2 protein, we computationally predicted compounds that are able
to modulate the reader of the corresponding modifications, BPTF, to recognize
other forms of the histone H3 lysine 4, instead of the tri-methylated form
normally produced by MLL2. By forming a synthetic triple-complex of a compound,
the histone H3 tail and BPTF we potentially circumvent the requirement for
functional MLL2 methyl-transferase through the modulation of BPTF activity.
Here we show a proof-of-principle that special compounds, named variators, can
reprogram selectivity of protein binding and thus create artificial regulatory
pathways which can have a potential therapeutic role. A therapeutic role of
BPTF variators may extend to other diseases that involve loss of MLL2 function,
such as Kabuki syndrome or the aberrant functioning of H3K4 modification as
observed in Huntington disease and in memory formation.

learning, which performs the task through a series of nonlinear transformations
from the representation of the input sequence (e.g., a Chinese sentence) to the
final output sequence (e.g., translation to English). Inspired by the recently
proposed Neural Turing Machine (Graves et al., 2014), we store the intermediate
representations in stacked layers of memories, and use read-write operations on
the memories to realize the nonlinear transformations between the
representations. The types of transformations are designed in advance but the
parameters are learned from data. Through layer-by-layer transformations,
DEEPMEMORY can model complicated relations between sequences necessary for
applications such as machine translation between distant languages. The
architecture can be trained with normal back-propagation on sequenceto-sequence
data, and the learning can be easily scaled up to a large corpus. DEEPMEMORY is
broad enough to subsume the state-of-the-art neural translation model in
(Bahdanau et al., 2015) as its special case, while significantly improving upon
the model with its deeper architecture. Remarkably, DEEPMEMORY, being purely
neural network-based, can achieve performance comparable to the traditional
phrase-based machine translation system Moses with a small vocabulary and a
modest parameter size.

explained by invoking the anomalous electron heating which results in high
electrostatic potential formation at the target surface. Anomalous heating of
electrons beyond the energy of quiver motion in the laser field is described
within the framework of theoretical model of driven oscillator with a step-like

  Promises","Approx 2015",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A hypergraph is said to be $\chi$-colorable if its vertices can be colored
with $\chi$ colors so that no hyperedge is monochromatic. $2$-colorability is a
fundamental property (called Property B) of hypergraphs and is extensively
studied in combinatorics. Algorithmically, however, given a $2$-colorable
$k$-uniform hypergraph, it is NP-hard to find a $2$-coloring miscoloring fewer
than a fraction $2^{-k+1}$ of hyperedges (which is achieved by a random
$2$-coloring), and the best algorithms to color the hypergraph properly require
$\approx n^{1-1/k}$ colors, approaching the trivial bound of $n$ as $k$
increases.
  In this work, we study the complexity of approximate hypergraph coloring, for
both the maximization (finding a $2$-coloring with fewest miscolored edges) and
minimization (finding a proper coloring using fewest number of colors)
versions, when the input hypergraph is promised to have the following stronger
properties than $2$-colorability:
  (A) Low-discrepancy: If the hypergraph has discrepancy $\ell \ll \sqrt{k}$,
we give an algorithm to color the it with $\approx n^{O(\ell^2/k)}$ colors.
However, for the maximization version, we prove NP-hardness of finding a
$2$-coloring miscoloring a smaller than $2^{-O(k)}$ (resp. $k^{-O(k)}$)
fraction of the hyperedges when $\ell = O(\log k)$ (resp. $\ell=2$). Assuming
the UGC, we improve the latter hardness factor to $2^{-O(k)}$ for almost
discrepancy-$1$ hypergraphs.
  (B) Rainbow colorability: If the hypergraph has a $(k-\ell)$-coloring such
that each hyperedge is polychromatic with all these colors, we give a
$2$-coloring algorithm that miscolors at most $k^{-\Omega(k)}$ of the
hyperedges when $\ell \ll \sqrt{k}$, and complement this with a matching UG
hardness result showing that when $\ell =\sqrt{k}$, it is hard to even beat the
$2^{-k+1}$ bound achieved by a random coloring.

studies which found that its predicted distributions fit empirical data, and
that concatenation is not a consistent estimator of the species tree. *BEAST, a
fully Bayesian implementation of the multispecies coalescent, is popular but
computationally intensive, so the increasing size of phylogenetic data sets is
both a computational challenge and an opportunity for better systematics. Using
simulation studies, we characterize the scaling behaviour of *BEAST, and enable
quantitative prediction of the impact increasing the number of loci has on both
computational performance and statistical accuracy. Follow up simulations over
a wide range of parameters show that the statistical performance of *BEAST
relative to concatenation improves both as branch length is reduced and as the
number of loci is increased. Finally, using simulations based on estimated
parameters from two phylogenomic data sets, we compare the performance of a
range of species tree and concatenation methods to show that using *BEAST with
tens of loci can be preferable to using concatenation with thousands of loci.
Our results provide insight into the practicalities of Bayesian species tree

the situations in which supermatrix or summary methods will be outperformed by

evaluate several variations of deep ConvNets in the context of hierarchical,

We first present a dense labeling of local image patches via
$P{-}\mathrm{ConvNet}$ and nearest neighbor fusion. Then we describe a regional
ConvNet ($R_1{-}\mathrm{ConvNet}$) that samples a set of bounding boxes around
each image superpixel at different scales of contexts in a ""zoom-out"" fashion.
Our ConvNets learn to assign class probabilities for each superpixel region of

the joint space of CT intensities and the $P{-}\mathrm{ConvNet}$ dense
probability maps. Both 3D Gaussian smoothing and 2D conditional random fields
are exploited as structured predictions for post-processing. We evaluate on CT

coupling in the process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow h \gamma$ at the future high
luminosity $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders. Our numerical results show that the cross
section for this process can be significantly increased for the allowed CP
phase $\xi$ and center of mass energy. For example the cross section is about 6
times of that in the standard model (SM) for $\sqrt{s}=350~\mathrm{GeV}$ and
$\xi =3\pi/5$ (see text for $\xi$ definition). The simulation for the signal
process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow h \gamma \rightarrow b \bar{b}\gamma$ and its
backgrounds shows that the signal significance can reach more than $4.8\sigma$
and $2.3\sigma$ for $\sqrt{s}=350~\mathrm{GeV},\ 500~\mathrm{GeV}$
respectively, with the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=3~\text{ab}^{-1}$ and
$\xi\in[\pi/2,3\pi/5]$. For $\mathcal{L}=10~\text{ab}^{-1}$, the signal
significance can be greater than 5 for $\sqrt{s}=350~\mathrm{GeV}$ and 3.9 for
$\sqrt{s}=500~\mathrm{GeV}$ with the CP phase $\xi\in[\pi/2,3\pi/5]$. Besides
the cross section enhancement, the CP-violating $h\bar{t}t$ coupling will
induce the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ which is absent in the SM and is
a clear signal of new CP violation. Compared with the $A_{FB}$ in the Higgs
decay $h\rightarrow l^{+}l^{-}\gamma$, the $A_{FB}$ can be greatly enhanced in
the production process. For example $A_{FB}$ can reach 0.5 for $\cos\xi\simeq
0.7$ and $\sqrt{s}=500~\mathrm{GeV}$. Due to the large backgrounds, the
significance of the expected $A_{FB}$ can only be observed at $1.7\sigma$ with
$\mathcal{L}=10~\text{ab}^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{s}=500~\mathrm{GeV}$. It is
essential to trigger the single photon in the final state to separate the
bottom jets arising from scalar or vector bosons, in order to isolate the
signal from the backgrounds more efficiently.

singlet-dominated particles including one neutralino, one CP-odd Higgs boson
and one CP-even Higgs boson can be simultaneously lighter than about 100 GeV.
Consequently, dark matter (DM) in the NMSSM can annihilate into multiple final
states to explain the galactic center gamma-ray excess (GCE). In this work we
take into account the foreground and background uncertainties for the GCE and
investigate these explanations. We carry out a sophisticated scan over the
NMSSM parameter space by considering various experimental constraints such as
the Higgs data, $B$-physics observables, DM relic desnity, LUX experiment and
the dSphs constraints. Then for each surviving parameter point we perform a fit
to the GCE spectrum by using the correlation matrix that incorporates both the
statistical and systematic uncertainties of the measured excess. After
examining the properties of the obtained GCE solutions, we conclude that the
GCE can be well explained by the pure annihilations $\tilde{\chi}_1^0
\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to b \bar{b} $ and $\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to A_1
H_i $ with $A_1$ being the lighter singlet-dominated CP-odd Higgs boson and
$H_i$ denoting the singlet-dominated CP-even Higgs boson or SM-like Higgs
boson, and it can also be explained by the mixed annihilation $\tilde{\chi}_1^0
\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to W^+ W^-, A_1 H_1$. Among these annihilation channels,
$\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to A_1 H_i $ can provide the best
interpretation with the corresponding $p$-value reaching 0.55. We also discuss
to what extent the future DM direct detection experiments can explore the GCE

intertwined, the rules for adjusting the synaptic weights can only depend on
variables that are available locally, such as the activity of the pre- and

framework for studying the space of local learning rules is obtained by first
specifying the nature of the local variables, and then the functional form that
ties them together into each learning rule. Such a framework enables also the
systematic discovery of new learning rules and exploration of relationships
between learning rules and group symmetries. We study polynomial local learning
rules stratified by their degree and analyze their behavior and capabilities in
both linear and non-linear units and networks. Stacking local learning rules in
deep feedforward networks leads to deep local learning. While deep local
learning can learn interesting representations, it cannot learn complex
input-output functions, even when targets are available for the top layer.
Learning complex input-output functions requires local deep learning where
target information is communicated to the deep layers through a backward
learning channel. The nature of the communicated information about the targets
and the structure of the learning channel partition the space of learning
algorithms. We estimate the learning channel capacity associated with several
algorithms and show that backpropagation outperforms them by simultaneously
maximizing the information rate and minimizing the computational cost, even in
recurrent networks. The theory clarifies the concept of Hebbian learning,
establishes the power and limitations of local learning rules, introduces the
learning channel which enables a formal analysis of the optimality of
backpropagation, and explains the sparsity of the space of learning rules

does. In this work, we examine if the tensor bi-spectrum can discriminate

over scales of cosmological interest, the non-Gaussianity parameter $h_{_{\rm

inflation, the amplitude of the tensor perturbations freeze on super-Hubble

the tensor bi-spectrum and the power spectrum in the squeezed limit. In
contrast, in the bouncing scenarios, the amplitude of the tensor perturbations
grow strongly as one approaches the bounce, which suggests that the consistency
condition will not be valid in such situations. We explicitly show that the
consistency relation is indeed violated in the matter bounce. We discuss the
implications of the results.

the analogues of mesonic states in QCD, while for q = 3, depending on the sign
of the field, the spectrum may also contain three-kink bound states which are
the analogues of the baryons. In recent years the resulting ""hadron"" spectrum
was described using several different approaches, such as quantum mechanics in

While mesonic states in the Ising model have already been considered in a
different truncated Hamiltonian approach, this is the first time that a
precision numerical study is performed for the 3-state Potts model. We find
that the semiclassical approach provides a very accurate description for the
mesonic spectrum in all the parameter regime for weak magnetic field, while the
low-energy expansion from the Bethe-Salpeter equation is only valid for very
weak fields where it gives a slight improvement over the semiclassical results.

of the rotation parameter of the Kerr-Newman metric up to the second order. It
is found that with the present treatment, the stress tensor of the thin shell
in general has anisotropic pressure, i.e., the thin shell cannot be composed of
a dust if the rotational effects are taken into account. However, the thin

symmetry energy in the range $30\,\mbox{MeV}\le L_S\le 50\,\mbox{MeV}$, are
consistent with the results from other approaches and with the experimental

exciting scientific challenges. To study such materials, Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulations have been extensively used because they provide a direct view
into its microscopic structure. MD is therefore used not only to reproduce real
system properties but also benefits from detailed atomic scale analysis.
Unfortunately, MD shows inherent limitations because of the limited
computational power. For instance, only the simulations of small systems are
currently permitted, which prevents from studying small compositional changes,
although it is well known that they can dramatically alter system properties.
At this stage, it is tempting to follow topological constraint theory, which
aims at describing macroscopic properties of the glass relying only on the
connectivity of individual atoms, thus considering the complicated glass
network as simple mechanical trusses. Thanks to only basic hand calculations,
this theory has been successful in predicting complex composition and
temperature behavior of glass properties, such as the glass forming ability,
the viscosity of the corresponding liquid or the elasticity. The purpose of my
PhD work is to connect these successful approaches based only on the topology
of the underlying low-temperature network with properties that can be obtained
from MD calculations. It should thus allow for an increased applicability of
rigidity theory.

  Sparse Network Dynamics","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and
  Networking (invited)",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a cross-layer framework to jointly optimize spectrum sensing
and scheduling in resource constrained agile wireless networks is presented. A
network of secondary users (SUs) accesses portions of the spectrum left unused
by a network of licensed primary users (PUs). A central controller (CC)
schedules the traffic of the SUs, based on distributed compressed measurements
collected by the SUs. Sensing and scheduling are jointly controlled to maximize
the SU throughput, with constraints on PU throughput degradation and SU cost.
The sparsity in the spectrum dynamics is exploited: leveraging a prior spectrum
occupancy estimate, the CC needs to estimate only a residual uncertainty vector
via sparse recovery techniques. The high complexity entailed by the POMDP
formulation is reduced by a low-dimensional belief representation via
minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It is proved that the
optimization of sensing and scheduling can be decoupled. A partially myopic
scheduling strategy is proposed for which structural properties can be proved
showing that the myopic scheme allocates SU traffic to likely idle spectral
bands. Simulation results show that this framework balances optimally the
resources between spectrum sensing and data transmission. This framework
defines sensing-scheduling schemes most informative for network control,
yielding energy efficient resource utilization.

perturbed internal and external spacetimes are matched with a uniformly

$\Omega$, is much smaller than the Keplerian frequency of the nonrotating

the exponential computational expense associated with the numerical projection

with mean density 100 cm$^{-3}$, $X_{CO}$ is only weakly dependent on the local
SFR, varying by a factor of a few over two orders of magnitude in SFR. In
contrast, we find that for similar clouds but with masses of 1e5 solar masses,
the X-factor will vary by an order of magnitude over the same range in SFR,
implying that extra-galactic star formation laws should be viewed with caution.
However, for denser ($10^4$ cm$^{-3}$), super-virial clouds such as those found
at the centre of the Milky Way, the X-factor is once again independent of the
local SFR.

to spin information processing. Although the coherent manipulation of electron
spins in semiconductors is now possible, the realization of a functional spin

owing to several fundamental challenges such as the low spin-injection
efficiency due to resistance mismatch, spin relaxation, and the spread of spin
precession angles. Alternative spin transistor designs have therefore been
proposed, but these differ from the field effect transistor concept and require
the use of optical or magnetic elements, which pose difficulties for the
incorporation into integrated circuits. Here, we present an all-electric and
all-semiconductor spin field effect transistor, in which these obstacles are
overcome by employing two quantum point contacts as spin injectors and
detectors. Distinct engineering architectures of spin-orbit coupling are
exploited for the quantum point contacts and the central semiconductor channel
to achieve complete control of the electron spins -- spin injection,
manipulation, and detection -- in a purely electrical manner. Such a device is
compatible with large-scale integration and hold promise for future spintronic

Earth-like atmospheres and biospheres is a major goal in exoplanet research. If
such planets exist, the question remains as to whether they could be identified
via spectral signatures of biomarkers. Such planets may be exposed to extreme
intensities of cosmic rays that could perturb their atmospheric photochemistry.
Here, we consider stellar activity of M-dwarfs ranging from quiet up to strong
flaring conditions and investigate one particular effect upon biomarkers,
namely, the ability of secondary electrons caused by stellar cosmic rays to
break up atmospheric molecular nitrogen (N2), which leads to production of
nitrogen oxides in the planetary atmosphere, hence affecting biomarkers such as
ozone. We apply a stationary model, that is, without a time-dependence, hence
we are calculating the limiting case where the atmospheric chemistry response
time of the biomarkers is assumed to be slow and remains constant compared with
rapid forcing by the impinging stellar flares. This point should be further
explored in future work with time-dependent models. For the flaring case O3 is
mainly destroyed via direct titration with nitrogen oxides and not via the
familiar catalytic cycle photochemistry, which occurs on Earth. For scenarios
with low O3, Rayleigh scattering by the main atmospheric gases became more
important for shielding the planetary surface from ultra-violet radiation. A
major result of this work is that the biomarker O3 survived all the
stellar-activity scenarios considered except for the strong case, whereas the
biomarker nitrous oxide could survive in the planetary atmosphere under all
conditions of stellar activity considered here, which clearly has important
implications for missions that aim to detect spectroscopic biomarkers.

0-dimensional systems, Bratteli--Vershik systems are homeomorphisms that have
Kakutani--Rohlin refinements. Bratteli diagram has a strong power to analyze
such systems. Besides this approach, general graph covers can be used to
represent any 0-dimensional system. Indeed, all 0-dimensional systems can be
described as a certain kind of sequences of graph covers that may not be
brought about by the Kakutani--Rohlin partitions. In this paper, we follow the
context of general graph covers to analyze the relations between ergodic
measures and circuits of graph covers. First, we formalize the condition for a
sequence of graph covers to represent minimal Cantor systems. In constructing
invariant measures, we deal with general compact metrizable 0-dimensional
systems. In the context of Bratteli diagrams with finite rank, it has
previously been mentioned that all ergodic measures should be limits of some
combinations of towers of Kakutani--Rohlin refinements. We demonstrate this for
general 0-dimensional case, and develop a theorem that expresses the
coincidence of the time average and the space average for ergodic measures.
Additionally, we formulate a theorem that signifies the old relation between
uniform convergence and unique ergodicity in the context of graph circuits for
general 0-dimensional systems. Unlike previous studies, in our case of general
graph covers, there arise a possibility of linear dependence of circuits. We
give a condition for a full circuit system to be linearly independent. Previous
researches also showed that the bounded combinatorics imply unique ergodicity.
We present a lemma that enables us to consider unbounded ranks of winding
matrices.

Several forbidden regions in the magnetic pitch angle/magnetization plane are
found where models of the class considered in our study could not be settled.
These forbidden regions are associated with the existence of maximum axial and
toroidal magnetic field components compatible with the prescribed equilibrium
condition at the jet surface, and/or an excess of centrifugal force producing
gaps with negative pressures in the jet. The present study can be easily
extended to jet models with different transversal profiles and magnetic field
configurations.

from a potential of the Stillinger Weber form. The transferability of the

solid state data, as usual, and from a new parametrization on the liquid

satisfactory transferability is found between the pure components and their

in contrast with the one obtained using the adjustment on the solid. The final
structure, after quenches down to the amorphous state, determined with the new

being in excellent agreement with recent X-rays diffraction experiments. The
corresponding critical temperature of the glass transition is estimated from
the behavior of the heat capacity. Discussion of the consistency between the

homomorphism ${\bf R} \rightarrow {\bf \Gamma}$ between two relational
structures. Analyzing its complexity has been a very fruitful research
direction, especially for fixed template CSPs, denoted $CSP({\bf \Gamma})$, in
which the right side structure ${\bf \Gamma}$ is fixed and the left side
structure ${\bf R}$ is unconstrained.
  Recently, the hybrid setting, written $CSP_{\mathcal{H}}({\bf \Gamma})$,
where both sides are restricted simultaneously, attracted some attention. It
assumes that ${\bf R}$ is taken from a class of relational structures
$\mathcal{H}$ that additionally is closed under inverse homomorphisms. The last
property allows to exploit algebraic tools that have been developed for fixed
template CSPs. The key concept that connects hybrid CSPs with fixed-template
CSPs is the so called ""lifted language"". Namely, this is a constraint language
${\bf \Gamma}_{{\bf R}}$ that can be constructed from an input ${\bf R}$. The
tractability of that language for any input ${\bf R}\in\mathcal{H}$ is a
necessary condition for the tractability of the hybrid problem.
  In the first part we investigate templates ${\bf \Gamma}$ for which the
latter condition is not only necessary, but also is sufficient. We call such
templates ${\bf \Gamma}$ widely tractable. For this purpose, we construct from
${\bf \Gamma}$ a new finite relational structure ${\bf \Gamma}'$ and define
$\mathcal{H}_0$ as a class of structures homomorphic to ${\bf \Gamma}'$. We
prove that wide tractability is equivalent to the tractability of
$CSP_{\mathcal{H}_0}({\bf \Gamma})$. Our proof is based on the key observation
that ${\bf R}$ is homomorphic to ${\bf \Gamma}'$ if and only if the core of
${\bf \Gamma}_{{\bf R}}$ is preserved by a Siggers polymorphism. Analogous
result is shown for valued conservative CSPs.

for the phase-coherent manipulation of heat in mesoscopic devices. In this work
we show that anomalous thermoelectric properties and efficient heat

point contacts, we demonstrate that the interference paths effectively break
the electron-hole symmetry, allowing for a thermoelectric charge current
flowing either from hot to cold or viceversa, depending on the details of the
tunnel junction. Correspondingly, an interference induced heat current is
predicted, and we are able to explain these results in terms of an intuitive
physical picture. Moreover, we show that heat rectification can be achieved by
coupling two quantum Hall systems with different filling factors, and that this

parameter spatially varies. This intrinsic spin is present even at equilibrium

finite spin. Because magnetic moments couple directly to external magnetic
fields, the intrinsic magnetization can alter the dynamics of antiferromagnetic
textures under such influence. Starting from the discrete Heisenberg model, we
derive the continuum limit of the free energy of AFMs in the exchange
approximation and explicitly rederive that the spatial variation of the
antiferromagnetic order parameter is associated with an intrinsic magnetization
density. We calculate the magnetization profile of a domain wall and discuss
how the intrinsic magnetization reacts to external forces. We show
conclusively, both analytically and numerically, that a spatially inhomogeneous
magnetic field can move and control the position of domain walls in AFMs. By
comparing our model to a commonly used alternative parametrization procedure
for the continuum fields, we show that the physical interpretations of these
fields depend critically on the choice of parametrization procedure for the

heavier species such as O and C atoms. After the main part of the

roles in evolutionary and ecological processes. Under frequency dependent
selection, the average fitness of the population may increase or decrease based
on interactions between individuals within the population. This should be
reflected in fluctuations of the population size even in constant environments.
Here, we propose a stochastic model, which naturally combines these two
evolutionary ingredients by assuming frequency dependent competition between
different types in an individual-based model. In contrast to previous game
theoretic models, the carrying capacity of the population and thus the
population size is determined by pairwise competition of individuals mediated
by evolutionary games and demographic stochasticity. In the limit of infinite
population size, the averaged stochastic dynamics is captured by the
deterministic competitive Lotka-Volterra equations. In small populations,
demographic stochasticity may instead lead to the extinction of the entire
population. As the population size is driven by the fitness in evolutionary
games, a population of cooperators is less prone to go extinct than a
population of defectors, whereas in the usual systems of fixed size, the
population would thrive regardless of its average payoff.

within its charging region. This paper investigates the impact of node speed on
the throughput of WCS overlaid mobile networks when packet transmissions are
constrained by the energy status of each node. The energy provision for each
node depends on its moving speed. A slow-moving node outside the charging
region is unable to receive energy from WCSs for a long time, while one inside
the charging region consistently recharges the battery. Reflecting on these
phenomena, we design a two-dimensional Markov chain, where the states
respectively represent the remaining energy and the distance to the nearest
WCS. Solving this enables the following theoretic insights. Firstly, the
throughput is a non-decreasing function of node speed. With faster node speed,
the throughput converges to that of the independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) mobility model where nodes can move anywhere without being restricted
by their previous positions. Secondly, if the battery capacity of each node is
infinite, the throughput is equivalent to that of the i.i.d. mobility model
regardless of node speed. Finally, the throughput scaling is calculated as
Theta(min(1, m/n)c^{\min(1,m/n))), where n and m represent the number of nodes
and WCSs, respectively.

bands linearly disperse around pairs of nodes, the Weyl points, of fixed (left

experimental search for the exotic quantum phenomenon known as the chiral
anomaly. Via the chiral anomaly nonorthogonal electric and magnetic fields
induce a chiral density imbalance that results in an unconventional negative
longitudinal magnetoresistance, the chiral magnetic effect. Recent theoretical
work suggests that this effect does not require well-defined Weyl nodes.
Experimentally however, it remains an open question to what extent it survives
when chirality is not well-defined, for example when the Fermi energy is far
away from the Weyl points. Here, we establish the detailed Fermi surface
topology of the recently identified WSM TaP via a combination of angle-resolved
quantum oscillation spectra and band structure calculations. The Fermi surface
forms spin-polarized banana-shaped electron and hole pockets attached to pairs
of Weyl points. Although the chiral anomaly is therefore ill-defined, we
observe a large negative magnetoresistance (NMR) appearing for collinear
magnetic and electric fields as observed in other WSMs. In addition, we show
experimental signatures indicating that such longitudinal magnetoresistance
measurements can be affected by an inhomogeneous current distribution inside

to understand how brain function arises from the collective dynamics of
networks of spiking neurons. This challenge has been chiefly addressed through
large-scale numerical simulations. Alternatively, researchers have formulated
mean-field theories to gain insight into macroscopic states of large neuronal
networks in terms of the collective firing activity of the neurons, or the
firing rate. However, these theories have not succeeded in establishing an
exact correspondence between the firing rate of the network and the underlying
microscopic state of the spiking neurons. This has largely constrained the
range of applicability of such macroscopic descriptions, particularly when
trying to describe neuronal synchronization. Here we provide the derivation of
a set of exact macroscopic equations for a network of spiking neurons. Our
results reveal that the spike generation mechanism of individual neurons
introduces an effective coupling between two biophysically relevant macroscopic
quantities, the firing rate and the mean membrane potential, which together
govern the evolution of the neuronal network. The resulting equations exactly
describe all possible macroscopic dynamical states of the network, including
states of synchronous spiking activity. Finally we show that the firing rate
description is related, via a conformal map, with a low-dimensional description
in terms of the Kuramoto order parameter, called Ott-Antonsen theory. We
anticipate our results will be an important tool in investigating how large

(mu-, y- and r-type) created by episodes of early energy release; however,
several processes also lead to copious photon production, which requires a
different treatment. Here, we carry out a first detailed study for the
evolution of distortions caused by photon injection at different energies in
the CMB bands. We provide detailed analytical and numerical calculations
illustrating the rich phenomenology of the associated distortion signals. We
show that photon injection at very high and very low frequencies creates
distortions that are similar to those from pure energy release. In the mu-era
(z>3x10^5), a positive or negative chemical potential can be formed, depending
on the balance between added photon energy and number. At lower redshifts
(z<3x10^5), partial information about the photon injection process (i.e.,
injection time and energy) can still be recovered, with the distortion being
found in a partially comptonized state. We briefly discuss current and future
constraints on scenarios with photon production. We also argue that more
detailed calculations for different scenarios with photon injection may be

the problem of angular momentum transfer in the course of ultrafast

reversal is supported by a coupling of $d-$ and $f-$ subsystems to delocalized

thermosphere due to the absorption of the stellar soft X-ray and extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) flux. We find that when the $\beta$ value near the

results indicate a crucial enhancement of the atmospheric escape rate, when the
Jeans escape parameter $\beta$ decreases to this critical value. When $\beta$
becomes $\leq$2.5, there is no stationary hydrodynamic transition from subsonic

spectral criteria to constrain the origin of large-scale wind structure in O
stars. We argue that excited state lines must arise close to the stellar
surface and are an excellent diagnostic complement to resonance lines which,
due to radiative transfer effects, rarely show variability at low velocity.
Consequently, we splice dynamic spectra of the excited state line, N IV1718, at
low velocity to those of 1393 component of the Si IV 1400 doublet at high
velocity in order to examine the temporal evolution of wind line features.
These spliced time series reveal that nearly all of the features observed in
the time series originate at or very near the stellar surface. Further, we
positively identify the observational signature of equatorial co-rotating
interaction regions in two of the five stars and possibly two others. In
addition, we see no evidence for features originating further out in the wind.
We use our results to consolidate the fact that the features seen in dynamic
spectra must be huge, in order to remain in the line of sight for days,
persisting to very large velocity and that the photospheric footprint of the
features must also be quite large, ~ 15 - 20% of the stellar diameter.

small transients in time and/or amplitude. These generalized contractive

simple and checkable conditions guaranteeing that a system is a GCS, and
demonstrate their usefulness using several models from systems biology. Second,
allowing small transients does not destroy the important asymptotic properties
of contractive systems like convergence to a unique equilibrium point, if it
exists, and entrainment to a periodic excitation. Third, in some cases as we
change the parameters in a contractive system it becomes a GCS just before it
looses contractivity with respect to a norm. In this respect, generalized
contractivity is the analogue of marginal stability in Lyapunov stability
theory.

fields appear due to the large velocity of the colliding charges. The evolution
of these fields appears as a novel and intriguing feature in the
fluid-dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we study
analytically the one-dimensional, longitudinally boost-invariant motion of an
ideal fluid in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Interestingly, we
find that, in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, i.e., for infinite
conductivity, and irrespective of the strength of the initial magnetization,
the decay of the fluid energy density $e$ with proper time $\tau$ is the same
as for the time-honored ""Bjorken flow"" without magnetic field. Furthermore,
when the magnetic field is assumed to decay $\sim \tau^{-a}$, where $a$ is an
arbitrary number, two classes of analytic solutions can be found depending on
whether $a$ is larger or smaller than one. In summary, the analytic solutions
presented here highlight that the Bjorken flow is far more general than
formerly thought. These solutions can serve both to gain insight on the
dynamics of heavy-ion collisions in the presence of strong magnetic fields and
as testbeds for numerical codes.

graphs in full generality. The general theory turns out to be almost completely
analogous to that of cofinite groups. For instance, every cofinite directed
graph has a unique completion which is a com- pact cofinite direct graph.
Moreover, compact cofinite directed graphs are precisely the profinite directed
graphs, i.e., projective limits of finite discrete topological directed graphs.
We then apply the general theory to directed graphs with additional structure
such as graphs (in the sense of Serre) and groupoids, thus leading to the
notions of cofinite graphs and cofinite groupoids. Cofinite groupoids with only
finitely many identities behave much the same as cofinite groups, which are the

for cofinite groupoids with infinitely many identities is more complicated.

text, i.e., using image to search text (I2T) and using text to search images
(T2I). Existing cross-media retrieval methods usually learn one couple of
projections, by which the original features of images and text can be projected
into a common latent space to measure the content similarity. However, using
the same projections for the two different retrieval tasks (I2T and T2I) may
lead to a tradeoff between their respective performances, rather than their
best performances. Different from previous works, we propose a
modality-dependent cross-media retrieval (MDCR) model, where two couples of
projections are learned for different cross-media retrieval tasks instead of
one couple of projections. Specifically, by jointly optimizing the correlation
between images and text and the linear regression from one modal space (image
or text) to the semantic space, two couples of mappings are learned to project
images and text from their original feature spaces into two common latent
subspaces (one for I2T and the other for T2I). Extensive experiments show the
superiority of the proposed MDCR compared with other methods. In particular,
based the 4,096 dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) visual feature
and 100 dimensional LDA textual feature, the mAP of the proposed method
achieves 41.5\%, which is a new state-of-the-art performance on the Wikipedia
dataset.

from a very large collection, commonly referred to as support recovery or

proposing a rich variety of algorithms. In scientific applications, it is of
crucial importance to quantify uncertainty in variable selection, providing
measures of statistical significance for each variable. The overwhelming
majority of algorithms fail to produce such measures. This has led to a focus
in the scientific literature on independent screening methods, which examine
each variable in isolation, obtaining p-values measuring the significance of
marginal associations. Bayesian methods provide an alternative, with marginal
inclusion probabilities used in place of p-values. Bayesian variable selection
has advantages, but is impractical computationally beyond small problems. In
this article, we show that approximate message passing (AMP) and Bayesian
compressed regression (BCR) can be used to rapidly obtain accurate
approximations to marginal inclusion probabilities in high-dimensional variable
selection. Theoretical support is provided, simulation studies are conducted to
assess performance, and the method is applied to a study relating brain
networks to creative reasoning.

the role of latency awareness on data delivery performance in ICN and introduce
LAC, a new simple, yet very effective, Latency-Aware Cache management policy.
The designed mechanism leverages in a distributed fashion local latency
observations to decide whether to store an object in a network cache. The
farther the object, latency-wise, the more favorable the caching decision. By
means of simulations, show that LAC outperforms state of the art proposals and
results in a reduction of the content mean delivery time and standard deviation
by up to 50%, along with a very fast convergence to these figures.

continuous speech signals. For this purpose, we propose an integrative
generative model that combines a language model and an acoustic model into a
single generative model called the ""hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden

hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semi-Markov model (HDP-HSMM) proposed by
Johnson et al. An inference procedure for the HDP-HLM is derived using the
blocked Gibbs sampler originally proposed for the HDP-HSMM. This procedure
enables the simultaneous and direct inference of language and acoustic models
from continuous speech signals. Based on the HDP-HLM and its inference
procedure, we developed a novel double articulation analyzer. By assuming
HDP-HLM as a generative model of observed time series data, and by inferring
latent variables of the model, the method can analyze latent double
articulation structure, i.e., hierarchically organized latent words and
phonemes, of the data in an unsupervised manner. The novel unsupervised double
articulation analyzer is called NPB-DAA.
  The NPB-DAA can automatically estimate double articulation structure embedded
in speech signals. We also carried out two evaluation experiments using
synthetic data and actual human continuous speech signals representing Japanese
vowel sequences. In the word acquisition and phoneme categorization tasks, the
NPB-DAA outperformed a conventional double articulation analyzer (DAA) and

to present efficient blind source separation (BSS) algorithms dedicated to

algorithms are presented dealing with the multimodulus (MM) and alphabet
matched (AM) criteria. For the optimization of these cost functions, iterative
methods of Givens and hyperbolic rotations are used. A pre-whitening operation
is also utilized to reduce the complexity of design problem. It is noticed that
the designed algorithms using Givens rotations gives satisfactory performance
only for large number of samples. However, for small number of samples, the
algorithms designed by combining both Givens and hyperbolic rotations
compensate for the ill-whitening that occurs in this case and thus improves the
performance. Two algorithms dealing with the MM criterion are presented for
moderate order QAM signals such as 16-QAM. The other two dealing with the AM
criterion are presented for high-order QAM signals. These methods are finally
compared with the state of art batch BSS algorithms in terms of
signal-to-interference and noise ratio, symbol error rate and convergence rate.
Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the contemporary

computing tasks which seem to be ideally suitable for cellular automata (CA).
Unfortunately, there exists no one-dimensional two-state CA which classifies
binary strings according to their densities. If, however, in place of simple
cells one uses agents which change their behaviour from one rule to another
after a fixed number of iterations, the classification can be performed by the
traffic rule 184 and the majority rule 232. This two-rule solution cannot be
easily generalized to two (or higher) dimensions, because it critically depends
on a kinetic phase transition occurring in the rule 184. No rule exhibiting
analogous transition is known in two dimensions, most likely because no such
rule exists. We propose, therefore, to approach this problem form a slightly
different angle, namely by introducing a stochastic component into each of the
two rules. If one precedes each iteration of rule 184 by the stochastic ""lane
changing rule,"" and each iteration of rule 232 by the stochastic ""crowd
avoidance"" rule, in the limit of infinitely many iterations the classification
can be performed correctly with probability 1. This solution can be described
either in the language of CA, or using the paradigm of agents which move and
proliferate on the 2D lattice, following probabilistic rules.

A few methods have been proposed to overcome this issue, such as ensemble
switching and the use of auxiliary partition-function ratios. Here, we present
an approach that builds on the recently proposed free-fermion decomposition
method; it incorporates entanglement in the probability measure in a natural
way; it takes advantage of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (an essential tool
in lattice quantum chromodynamics and other gauge theories with dynamical
fermions); and it does not suffer from noise problems. This method displays no
sign problem for the same cases as other approaches and is therefore useful for
a wide variety of systems. As a proof of principle, we calculate $S_2^{}$ for
the one-dimensional, half-filled Hubbard model and compare with results from
exact diagonalization and the free-fermion decomposition method.

provides insights into the working of the algorithm, and eliminates the need

based on observations by Planck/WMAP. The Commander component-separation tool
has been used to separate the various astrophysical processes in total
intensity. Comparison with RRL templates verifies the recovery of the free-free
emission along the Galactic plane. Comparison of the high-latitude Halpha
emission with our free-free map shows residuals that correlate with dust
optical depth, consistent with a fraction (~30%) of Halpha having been
scattered by high-latitude dust. We highlight a number of diffuse spinning dust
morphological features at high latitude. There is substantial spatial variation
in the spinning dust spectrum, with the emission peak ranging from below 20GHz
to more than 50GHz. There is a strong tendency for the spinning dust component
near many prominent HII regions to have a higher peak frequency, suggesting
that this increase in peak frequency is associated with dust in the
photodissociation regions around the nebulae. The emissivity of spinning dust
in these diffuse regions is of the same order as previous detections in the
literature. Over the entire sky, the commander solution finds more anomalous
microwave emission than the WMAP component maps, at the expense of synchrotron
and free-free emission. This can be explained by the difficulty in separating
multiple broadband components with a limited number of frequency maps. Future
surveys (5-20GHz), will greatly improve the separation by constraining the
synchrotron spectrum. We combine Planck/WMAP data to make the highest S/N ratio
maps yet of the intensity of the all-sky polarized synchrotron emission at
frequencies above a few GHz. Most of the high-latitude polarized emission is
associated with distinct large-scale loops and spurs, and we re-discuss their
structure...

involves fast and accurate evaluation of candidate model structures. We propose
to enhance single model quality assessment with a functionality evaluation
phase for proteins whose quantitative functional characteristics are known. In
particular, this idea can be applied to evaluation of structural models of ion
channels, whose main function - conducting ions - can be quantitatively
measured with the patch-clamp technique providing the current-voltage
characteristics. The study was performed on a set of KcsA channel models
obtained from complete and incomplete contact maps. A fast continuous
electrodiffusion model was used for calculating the current-voltage
characteristics of structural models. We found that the computed charge
selectivity and total current were sensitive to structural and electrostatic
quality of models. In practical terms, we show that evaluating predicted
conductance values is an appropriate method to eliminate modes with an occluded
pore or with multiple erroneously created pores. Moreover, filtering models on
the basis of their predicted charge selectivity results in a substantial
enrichment of the candidate set in highly accurate models. In addition to being
a proof of the concept, our function-oriented single model quality assessment
tool can be directly applied for evaluation of structural models of
strongly-selective protein channels. Finally, our work raises an important
question whether a computational validation of functionality should not be
included in the evaluation process of structural models, whenever possible.

present a $5D$ universe as a product bundle over the $4D$ spacetime. This
enables us to introduce and study two categories of kinematic quantities
(expansions, shear, vorticity) in a $5D$ universe. One category is related to
the fourth dimension (time), and the other one comes from the assumption of the
existence of the fifth dimension. The Raychaudhuri type equations that we
obtain in the paper, lead us to results on the evolution of both the $4D$
expansion and $5D$ expansion in a $5D$ universe.

students learn to write mathematical proofs. Under the guidance of the user,
Proof Designer assists in writing outlines of proofs in elementary set theory.
Proof Designer was designed by Daniel Velleman in association with his book
""How To Prove It: A Structured Approach"" to help students apply the methods
discussed in the book, making classes based on the book more interactive.
  This article is an early report on the progress of our effort to ""bring set
theory to the masses"" by developing Proof Maker, a new Proof Designer-inspired
software that ports Proof Designer to hand-held devices such as smart-phones
and tablets. Proof Maker, when completed, will allow students to use Proof
Designer with the ease of a touch, literally, on their smart devices. Our goal
behind developing Proof Maker is to enable any one who is interested enough to
develop elementary set theory proofs anywhere he or she might be (think of
doing proofs while waiting at a bus stop!) and at any time he or she wishes
(think of writing proofs before going to bed, or even in bed!). In this paper
we report on the improvements we made to Proof Designer so far, and on the
(many) steps remaining for us to have a fully-functioning Proof Maker ""in our
hands"".

easy problem, for this, many studies describe methods for generating good error
correcting codes in terms of minimum distance. In a previous work, we have
presented the multiple impulse method (MIM) to evaluate the minimum distance of
linear codes. In this paper we will present an optimization of the MIM method
by genetic algorithms, and we found many new optimal Double and Triple
Circulant Codes (DCC & TCC) with the highest known parameters using the MIM
method as an evaluator of the minimum distance. Two approaches are used in the
exploration of the space of generators; the first is based on genetic
algorithms, however the second is on the random search algorithm.
