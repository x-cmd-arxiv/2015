they tend to adversely affect performance Networked Control Systems (NCSs) are
a class of control systems wherein control components exchange information
using a shared communication channel. Delays and packet losses in the
communication channels are usually random, thereby making the analysis and
design of control loops more complex. The usual assumptions in classical
control theory, such as delay free sensing and synchronous actuation, assume
lesser significance when it comes to NCSs. Hence, this necessitates a
reformulation/relook into the existing models used for NCS control loop
analysis and design. In this paper, we study and present the reformulations
required for NCSs to include random delays and packet loss in the channel. This
paper thereby gives a complete overview of what has been accomplished thus far
in NCS research and puts forth a unified framework for analyzing a host of
problems that can be captured as NCSs subjected to random delays and packet

P_rot ridges that optimally align these ridges to the one defined by Praesepe
and the Hyades. On the other hand, when the traditional Skumanich-type
multiplicative transformation is used, the ridges become far less aligned due
to the age-dependent slope change introduced by the period multiplication.
Therefore, we employ our simple additive gyro-age calibration on various
datasets of Galactic field stars to test its applicability. We show that, in
the overall sense, the gyro-ages are systematically greater than the isochrone
ages. The difference could exceed several giga years, depending on the stellar
parameters. Although the age overlap between the open clusters used in the
calibration and the field star samples is only partial, the systematic
difference indicates the limitation of the currently available gyro-age methods
and suggests that the rotation of field stars slows down with a considerably
lower speed than we would expect from the simple extrapolation of the stellar
rotation rates in open clusters.

fading. To tackle this problem, a phase rotation (PR) aided relay selection
(RS) scheme is proposed to enlarge the minium DD, which in turn improves the
SER performance. The proposed PR based scheme rotates the phases of the
transmitted symbols of one source and of the selected relay according to the
channel state information, aiming for increasing all DDs to be above a desired
bound. The lower bound is further optimized by using a MaxMin-RS criterion
associated with the channel gains. It is demonstrated that the PR aided
MaxMin-RS approach achieves full diversity gain and an improved array gain.
Furthermore, compared with the existing DF based schemes, the proposed scheme
allows more flexible relay antenna configurations.

system that exploits the parallel structures between images and sentences. In
our model, the process of generating the next word, given the previously

attention shifting among the visual regions imposes a thread of visual
ordering. This alignment characterizes the flow of ""abstract meaning"", encoding
what is semantically shared by both the visual scene and the text description.
Our system also makes another novel modeling contribution by introducing
scene-specific contexts that capture higher-level semantic information encoded
in an image. The contexts adapt language models for word generation to specific
scene types. We benchmark our system and contrast to published results on
several popular datasets. We show that using either region-based attention or
scene-specific contexts improves systems without those components. Furthermore,
combining these two modeling ingredients attains the state-of-the-art

  Early Release Support",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transaction Memory (TM) is a concurrency control abstraction that allows the
programmer to specify blocks of code to be executed atomically as transactions.
However, since transactional code can contain just about any operation
attention must be paid to the state of shared variables at any given time.
E.g., contrary to a database transaction, if a TM transaction reads a stale
value it may execute dangerous operations, like attempt to divide by zero,
access an illegal memory address, or enter an infinite loop. Thus
serializability is insufficient, and stronger safety properties are required in
TM, which regulate what values can be read, even by transactions that abort.
Hence, a number of TM safety properties were developed, including opacity, and
TMS1 and TMS2. However, such strong properties preclude using early release as
a technique for optimizing TM, because they virtually forbid reading from live
transactions. On the other hand, properties that do allow early release are
either not strong enough to prevent any of the problems mentioned above
(recoverability), or add additional conditions on transactions with early
release that limit their applicability (elastic opacity, live opacity, virtual
world consistency). This paper introduces last-use opacity, a new TM safety
property that is meant to be a compromise between strong properties like
opacity and serializability. The property eliminates all but a small class of
inconsistent views and poses no stringent conditions on transactions. For
illustration, we present a last-use opaque TM algorithm and show that it
satisfies the new safety property.

arbitrary times. We obtain a closed-form solution for the time-dependent joint

However, the inherent absorption losses pose fundamental challenge to the most
fascinating applications of metamaterials. Based on a novel plasmon injection
(PI or \Pi) scheme, we propose a coherent optical amplification technique to
compensate losses in metamaterials. Although the proof of concept device here
operates under normal incidence only, our proposed scheme can be generalized to
arbitrary form of incident waves. The \Pi-scheme is fundamentally different
than major optical amplification schemes. It does not require gain medium,
interaction with phonons, or any nonlinear medium. The \Pi-scheme allows for
loss-free metamaterials. It is ideally suited for mitigating losses in
metamaterials operating in the visible spectrum and is scalable to other
optical frequencies. These findings open the possibility of reviving the early
dreams of making 'magical' metamaterials from scratch.

latent Gaussian models (LGMs) is proposed in this paper. The sampling scheme is
a two block Gibbs sampling scheme designed to exploit the model structure of
LGMs. We refer to the proposed sampling scheme as the MCMC split sampler. The
principle idea behind the MCMC split sampler is to split the latent Gaussian
parameters into two vectors. The former vector consists of latent parameters
which appear in the data density function, while the latter vector consists of
latent parameters which do not appear in it. The former vector is placed in the
first block of the proposed sampling scheme and the latter vector is placed in
the second block along with any potential hyperparameters. The resulting
conditional posterior density functions within the blocks allow the MCMC split
sampler to handle, by design, LGMs with latent models imposed on more than just
the mean structure of the data density function. The MCMC split sampler is also
designed to be applicable for any choice of a parametric data density function.
Moreover, it scales well in terms of computational efficiency when the
dimension of the latent model increase.

union of linear subspaces. In the abstract form of the problem, where no noise
or other corruptions are present, the data are assumed to lie in general
position inside the algebraic variety of a union of subspaces, and the
objective is to decompose the variety into its constituent subspaces. Prior
algebraic-geometric approaches to this problem require the subspaces to be of
equal dimension, or the number of subspaces to be known. Subspaces of arbitrary
dimensions can still be recovered in closed form, in terms of all homogeneous
polynomials of degree $m$ that vanish on their union, when an upper bound m on
the number of the subspaces is given. In this paper, we propose an alternative,
provably correct, algorithm for addressing a union of at most $m$
arbitrary-dimensional subspaces, based on the idea of descending filtrations of
subspace arrangements. Our algorithm uses the gradient of a vanishing
polynomial at a point in the variety to find a hyperplane containing the
subspace S passing through that point. By intersecting the variety with this
hyperplane, we obtain a subvariety that contains S, and recursively applying
the procedure until no non-trivial vanishing polynomial exists, our algorithm
eventually identifies S. By repeating this procedure for other points, our
algorithm eventually identifies all the subspaces by returning a basis for
their orthogonal complement. Finally, we develop a variant of the abstract
algorithm, suitable for computations with noisy data. We show by experiments on
synthetic and real data that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several occasions, thus demonstrating the merit of
the idea of filtrations.

network, a seeding strategy aims to find a small set of seed users that are
able to maximize the spread of the influence, which is termed as influence
maximization problem. Despite a large number of works have studied this
problem, the existing seeding strategies are limited to the static social
networks. In fact, due to the high speed data transmission and the large
population of participants, the diffusion processes in real-world social
networks have many aspects of uncertainness. Unfortunately, as shown in the
experiments, in such cases the state-of-art seeding strategies are pessimistic
as they fails to trace the dynamic changes in a social network. In this paper,
we study the strategies selecting seed users in an adaptive manner. We first
formally model the Dynamic Independent Cascade model and introduce the concept
of adaptive seeding strategy. Then based on the proposed model, we show that a
simple greedy adaptive seeding strategy finds an effective solution with a
provable performance guarantee. Besides the greedy algorithm an efficient
heuristic algorithm is provided in order to meet practical requirements.
Extensive experiments have been performed on both the real-world networks and
synthetic power-law networks. The results herein demonstrate the superiority of
the adaptive seeding strategies to other standard methods.

than the current LTE standard. In order to meet the ever increasing demand, it
is inevitable that, future wireless networks will have to develop seamless
interconnection between multiple technologies. A manifestation of this idea is
the collaboration among different types of network tiers such as macro and
small cells, leading to the so-called heterogeneous networks (HetNets).
Researchers have used stochastic geometry to analyze such networks and
understand their real potential. Unsurprisingly, it has been revealed that
interference has a detrimental effect on performance, especially if not modeled
properly. Interference can be correlated in space and/or time, which has been
overlooked in the past. For instance, it is normally assumed that the nodes are
located completely independent of each other and follow a homogeneous Poisson
point process (PPP), which is not necessarily true in real networks since the
node locations are spatially dependent. In addition, the interference
correlation created by correlated stochastic processes has mostly been ignored.
To this end, we take a different approach in modeling the interference where we
use non-PPP, as well as we study the impact of spatial and temporal correlation
on the performance of HetNets. To illustrate the impact of correlation on
performance, we consider three case studies from real-life scenarios.
Specifically, we use massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to
understand the impact of spatial correlation; we use the random medium access
protocol to examine the temporal correlation; and we use cooperative relay
networks to illustrate the spatial-temporal correlation. We present several
numerical examples through which we demonstrate the impact of various
correlation types on the performance of HetNets.

low-order wavefront aberrations. The coronagraphic detection sensitivity at the

of the focal plane mask are corrected. To prevent starlight leakage at the
inner working angle of a phase mask coronagraph, we have introduced a
Lyot-based low-order wavefront sensor (LLOWFS), which senses aberrations using
the rejected starlight diffracted at the Lyot plane. In this paper, we present
the implementation, testing and results of LLOWFS on the Subaru Coronagraphic

systems is presented. For an elliptic curve represented as a ramified double
covering of CP^1, a meromorphic differential is constructed with the following
property: the common projection of its two zeros on the base of the covering,
regarded as a function of the only moving branch point of the covering, is a
solution of a Painleve VI equation. This differential provides an invariant
formulation of a classical Okamoto transformation for the Painleve VI
equations. A generalization of this differential to hyperelliptic curves is
also constructed. In this case, positions of zeros of the differential provide
part of a solution of the multidimensional Garnier system. The corresponding
solutions of the rank two Schlesinger systems associated with elliptic and
hyperelliptic curves are constructed in terms of this differential. The initial
data for construction of the meromorphic differential include a point in the
Jacobian of the curve, under the assumption that this point has nonvariable
coordinates with respect to the lattice of the Jacobian while the branch points
vary. It appears that the cases where the coordinates of the point are rational
correspond to periodic trajectories of the billiard ordered games associated
with g confocal quadrics in (g+1)-dimensional space. This is a generalization
of a situation studied by Hitchin, who related algebraic solutions of a

..., S_m \subseteq V_G$ such that the subgraph induced by each $S_i$ has $H$ as
a subgraph.
  We prove that if $H$ is 2-connected, $H$-Transversal and $H$-Packing are
almost as hard to approximate as general $k$-Hypergraph Vertex Cover and
$k$-Set Packing, so it is NP-hard to approximate them within a factor of
$\Omega (k)$ and $\widetilde \Omega (k)$ respectively. We also show that there
is a 1-connected $H$ where $H$-Transversal admits an $O(\log k)$-approximation
algorithm, so that the connectivity requirement cannot be relaxed from 2 to 1.
For a special case of $H$-Transversal where $H$ is a (family of) cycles, we
mention the implication of our result to the related Feedback Vertex Set
problem, and give a different hardness proof for directed graphs.

the possibility of mass loss. We have also derived [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe]

$\mbox{GI}/\mbox{GI}/n+\mbox{GI}$ queues in the efficiency-driven (ED) regime.
We use a one-dimensional diffusion process to approximate the virtual waiting
time process that is scaled in both space and time, with the number of servers
and the mean patience time as the respective scaling factors. Using this
diffusion model, we obtain the steady-state distributions of virtual waiting
time and queue length, which in turn yield simple formulas for performance
measures such as the service level and the effective abandonment fraction.
These formulas are generally accurate when the mean patience time is several
times longer than the mean service time and the patience time distribution does
not change rapidly around the mean virtual waiting time. For practical
purposes, these formulas outperform existing results that rely on the
exponential service time assumption.
  To justify the diffusion model, we formulate an asymptotic framework by
considering a sequence of queues, in which both the number of servers and the
mean patience time go to infinity. We prove that the space-time scaled virtual
waiting time process converges in distribution to the one-dimensional diffusion
process. A fundamental result for proving the diffusion limit is a functional
central limit theorem (FCLT) for the superposition of renewal processes. We
prove that the superposition of many independent, identically distributed
stationary renewal processes, after being centered and scaled in space and
time, converges in distribution to a Brownian motion. As a useful technical
tool, this theorem characterizes the service completion process in heavy
traffic, allowing us to greatly simplify the many-server analysis when service
times follow a general distribution.

respects to the General-Relativity + $\Lambda$CDM scenario occurs at $k\sim1 h
\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$. At these scales, it becomes necessary to account for known
degeneracies with baryon feedback and massive neutrinos, hence we place
constraints jointly on these three physical effects. To achieve this, we
formulate these modified gravity theories within a common tomographic
parameterization, we compute their impact on the clustering properties relative
to a GR universe, and propagate the observed modifications into the weak
lensing $\xi_{\pm}$ quantity. Confronted against the cosmic shear data, we
reject the $f(R)$ $\{ |f_{R_0}|=10^{-4}, n=1\}$ model with more than 99.9%
confidence interval (CI) when assuming a $\Lambda$CDM dark matter only model.
In the presence of baryonic feedback processes and massive neutrinos with total
mass up to 0.2eV, the model is disfavoured with at least 94% CI in all
different combinations studied. Constraints on the $\{ |f_{R_0}|=10^{-4},

identify several specific combinations of neutrino mass, baryon feedback and
$f(R)$ or Dilaton gravity models that are excluded by the current cosmic shear

are strongly disfavoured in all modified gravity scenarios studied. These
results indicate that competitive constraints may be achieved with future
cosmic shear data.

is necessary to follow. No reader should be discouraged when he or she cannot
understand everything on first readings - infinity is not a piece of cake.

dramatically changing the foundations of mathematics.

measurement fidelity caused by a detuned neighboring qubit. We find that in
realistic parameter regimes, where the qubit ensemble-dephasing rate is slower
than the qubit-qubit detuning, the joint qubit-qubit eigenstates are better
discriminated by measurement than the bare states. Furthermore, we show that
when the resonator leaks much more slowly than the qubit-qubit detuning, the
measurement tracks the joint eigenstates nearly adiabatically. However, the
measurement process also causes rare quantum jumps between the eigenstates. The
rate of these jumps becomes significant if the resonator decay is comparable to
or faster than the qubit-qubit detuning, thus significantly degrading the
measurement fidelity in a manner reminiscent of energy relaxation processes.

rate due to the external force driving the flow and the dissipation rate
accounting for the rupture of capillary bridges. The resulting prediction of
$\sigma_a$ is a non-linear function of the packing fraction $\phi$, and the

use of 125I brachytherapy source will greatly amplify the amount of dose
enhancement factor (DEF) in the tumor site without inflicting much damage to
healthy organs, when compared to the 103Pd source. Furthermore in Monte-Carlo
studies of eye brachytherapy, more precise definition of the eye phantom
instead of a water phantom will become increasingly important when we use 125I

an insulator with a very long $T_1$, whereas the other component is attributed
to a sample fraction with high defect content with a short $T_1$ resulting from
interaction with the conduction carriers. The absence of a very long $T_1$ in

fast and effective discovery of representative and discriminative patterns from
a huge number of image patches. When we retrieve and visualize image patches
with the same pattern, surprisingly, they are not only visually similar but
also semantically consistent, and thus give rise to a mid-level visual element
in our work. Given the patterns and retrieved mid-level visual elements, we
propose two methods to generate image feature representations for each. The
first method is to use the patterns as codewords in a dictionary, similar to
the Bag-of-Visual-Words model, we compute a Bag-of-Patterns representation. The
second one relies on the retrieved mid-level visual elements to construct a
Bag-of-Elements representation. We evaluate the two encoding methods on scene
and object classification tasks, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms
or matches recent works using CNN activations for these tasks.

sufficient conditions for the StRIP property of a matrix in terms of the mutual

parameters. The tightest constraints for the coupling constant are
$\beta=-0.026^{+0.036}_{-0.053}$ (for $Q=3\beta H\rho_{\Lambda}$) and
$\beta=-0.00045\pm0.00069$ (for $Q=3\beta H\rho_c$) at the $1\sigma$ level. For

scenario. To investigate the observational properties of relatively low-mass
helium stars in binary systems as SN Ib/c progenitors, we constructed
atmospheric models with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, using
binary star evolution models. We find that these helium stars can be
characterized by relatively narrow helium emission lines if the mass-loss rate
during the final evolutionary phase is significantly enhanced as implied by
many SN Ib/c observations. The optical brightness of helium star progenitors
can be meaningfully enhanced with a strong wind for $M \gtrsim 4.4 M_\odot$,
but hardly affected or slightly weakened for relatively low-mass of $\sim 3.0
M_\odot$, compared to the simple estimate using blackbody approximation. We
further confirm the previous suggestion that the optical brightness would be
generally higher for a less massive SN Ib/c progenitor. In good agreement with
previous studies, our results indicate that the optical magnitudes and colors
of the recently detected progenitor of the SN Ib iPTF13bvn can be well
explained by a binary progenitor with a final helium star mass of about 3.0 --

measures of phylogenetic and functional dissimilarity with a main objective:
disentangling the processes that drive species distributions from local to
broad scales. A fundamental difference between phylogenetic and functional
analyses is that phylogeny is intrinsically dependent on a tree-like structure.
When the branches of a phylogenetic tree have lengths, then each evolutionary
unit on these branches can be considered as a basic entity on which
dissimilarities among sites should be measured. Several of the recent measures
of phylogenetic dissimilarities among sites thus are traditional dissimilarity
indices where species are replaced by evolutionary units. The resulting indices
were named PD-dissimilarity indices. Here I review and compare indices and
ordination approaches that, although first developed to analyse the differences
in the species compositions of sites, can be adapted to describe
PD-dissimilarities among sites, thus revealing how lineages are distributed
along environmental gradients, or among habitats or regions. As an
illustration, I show that the amount of PD-dissimilarities among the main
habitats of a disturbance gradient in Selva Lacandona of Chiapas, Mexico is
strongly dependent on whether species are weighted by their abundance or not,
and on the index used to measure PD-dissimilarity. Overall, the family of
PD-dissimilarity indices has a critical potential for future analyses of
phylogenetic diversity as it benefits from decades of research on the measure
of species dissimilarity. I provide clues to help to choose among many
potential indices, identifying which indices satisfy minimal basis properties,
and analysing their sensitivity to abundance, size, diversity, and joint
absences.

accuracy in forecasting can bring about high profits. Fuzzy Time Series (FTS)
and Longest Common/Repeated Sub-sequence (LCS/LRS) are two important issues for
forecasting prices. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no
significant studies using LCS/LRS to predict stock prices. It is impossible
that prices stay exactly the same as historic prices. Therefore, this paper
proposes a state-of-the-art method which combines FTS and LCS/LRS to predict
stock prices. This method is based on the principle that history will repeat
itself. It uses different interval lengths in FTS to fuzzify the prices, and
LCS/LRS to look for the same pattern in the historical prices to predict future
stock prices. In the experiment, we examine various intervals of fuzzy time
sets in order to achieve high prediction accuracy. The proposed method
outperforms traditional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and,
furthermore, it is easy to implement.

generation of wireless cellular networks (5G) is densification, which benefits
from the extensive spatial reuse of the spectrum and the reduced distance
between transmitters and receivers. In this paper, we examine the performance
of different schedulers in ultra dense small cell deployments. Due to the
stronger line of sight (LOS) at low inter-site distances (ISDs), we discuss
that the Rician fading channel model is more suitable to study network
performance than the Rayleigh one, and model the Rician K factor as a function
of distance between the user equipment (UE) and its serving base station (BS).
We also construct a cross-correlation shadowing model that takes into account
the ISD, and finally investigate potential multi-user diversity gains in ultra
dense small cell deployments by comparing the performances of proportional fair
(PF) and round robin (RR) schedulers. Our study shows that as network becomes
denser, the LOS component starts to dominate the path loss model which
significantly increases the interference. Simulation results also show that
multi-user diversity is considerably reduced at low ISDs, and thus the PF
scheduling gain over the RR one is small, around 10% in terms of cell
throughput. As a result, the RR scheduling may be preferred for dense small
cell deployments due to its simplicity. Despite both the interference
aggravation as well as the multi-user diversity loss, network densification is
still worth it from a capacity view point.

coevolution is vital for understanding system responses to change at all

question thus persists: are there alternative organising principles that enable
us to understand how coevolution of component species creates complex
collective behaviours exhibited at the community level? We address this issue
using principles from connectionist learning, a discipline with well-developed
theories of emergent behaviours in simple networks. We identify conditions
where selection on ecological interactions is equivalent to 'unsupervised
learning' (a simple type of connectionist learning) and observe that this
enables communities to self organize without community-level selection. Despite
not being a Darwinian unit, ecological communities can behave like
connectionist learning systems, creating internal organisation that habituates
to past environmental conditions and actively recalling those conditions.

  We introduce the notion of faithful extension of a linear combination of

quantum mutual information and the quantum conditional entropy.
  Then we show that the conditional mutual information can be uniquely defined
as a lower semicontinuous function on the set of all states of a tripartite

dimensions.
  Infinite-dimensional generalizations of some other measures of quantum

that almost all of these generalized measures are globally lower semicontinuous

analysis of quantum systems.

networking platforms, streamlining application development and enabling precise
formal reasoning about network behavior. Unfortunately, current compilers only
handle ""local"" programs that specify behavior in terms of hop-by-hop forwarding
behavior, or modest extensions such as simple paths. To encode richer ""global""
behaviors, programmers must add extra state -- something that is tricky to get
right and makes programs harder to write and maintain. Making matters worse,
existing compilers can take tens of minutes to generate the forwarding state
for the network, even on relatively small inputs. This forces programmers to
waste time working around performance issues or even revert to using
hardware-level APIs.
  This paper presents a new compiler for the NetKAT language that handles rich
features including regular paths and virtual networks, and yet is several
orders of magnitude faster than previous compilers. The compiler uses symbolic
automata to calculate the extra state needed to implement ""global"" programs,
and an intermediate representation based on binary decision diagrams to
dramatically improve performance. We describe the design and implementation of
three essential compiler stages: from virtual programs (which specify behavior
in terms of virtual topologies) to global programs (which specify network-wide
behavior in terms of physical topologies), from global programs to local
programs (which specify behavior in terms of single-switch behavior), and from
local programs to hardware-level forwarding tables. We present results from
experiments on real-world benchmarks that quantify performance in terms of
compilation time and forwarding table size.

by a factor given by the group index, which can be as high as 105 for
experimentally realizable parameters. We also show that the fundamental
linewidth of such a laser is expected to be smaller by the same factor. We
first present an analysis where the gain profile is modeled as a superposition
of two Lorentzian functions. We then present a numerical study based on a
physical scheme for realizing the composite gain profile. In this scheme, the
broad gain is produced by a high pressure buffer-gas loaded cell of rubidium
vapor. The narrow gain is produced by using a Raman pump in a second rubidium

Bourgade-Kuan-Rodgers statistic of Riemann zeroes are conjecturally related to
the distribution of the total mass of the limit lognormal stochastic measure of
Mandelbrot-Bacry-Muzy. The conjecture implies that a non-trivial,
log-infinitely divisible probability distribution is associated with Riemann
zeroes. For application, integral moments, covariance structure, multiscaling
spectrum, and asymptotics associated with the exponential functional are
computed in closed form using the known meromorphic extension of the Selberg
integral.

cosmological constant in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity. Here, we have considered
the simplest form of $f(R,T)$ i.e. $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$, where $R$ is the Ricci
scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy momentum tensor and explored the
spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Locally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS)
Bianchi type-I cosmological model. It is assumed that the Universe is filled
with two non-interacting matter sources namely scalar field (normal or phantom)
with scalar potential and matter contribution due to $f(R,T)$ action. We have
discussed two cosmological models according to power law and exponential law of
the volume expansion along with constant and exponential scalar potential as
sub models. Power law models are compatible with normal (quintessence) and
phantom scalar field whereas exponential volume expansion models are compatible
with only normal (quintessence) scalar field. The values of cosmological
constant in our models are in agreement with the observational results.
Finally, we have discussed some physical and kinematical properties of both the
models.

"1506.08059","Clifford Chafin","Clifford Chafin","Thermalization of Gases: A First Principles Approach",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previous approaches of emergent thermalization for condensed matter based on
typical wavefunctions are extended to generate an intrinsically quantum theory
of gases. Gases are fundamentally quantum objects at all temperatures, by
virtue of rapid delocalization of their constituents. When there is a
sufficiently broad spread in the energy of eigenstates, a well-defined
temperature is shown to arise by photon production when the samples are
optically thick. This produces a highly accurate approximation to the Planck
distribution so that thermalization arises from the initial data as a
consequence of purely quantum and unitary dynamics. These results are used as a
foil for some common hydrodynamic theory of ultracold gases. It is suggested
here that strong history dependence typically remains in these gases and so
limits the validity of thermodynamics in their description. These problems are
even more profound in the extension of hydrodynamics to such gases when they
are optically thin, even when their internal energy is not low. We investigate
rotation of elliptically trapped gases and consistency problems with deriving a
local hydrodynamic approach. The presence of vorticity that is ""hidden"" from
order parameter approaches is discussed along with some buoyancy intrinsically
associated with vorticity that gives essential quantum corrections to gases in
the regimes where standard perturbation approaches to the Boltzmann equations
are known to fail to converge. These results suggest that studying of trapped
gases in the far from ultracold regions may yield interesting results not
described by classical hydrodynamics.

cornerstone of the general theory of relativity, the most precise theory of
gravity confirmed in all experiments up to date. The WEP states the equivalence
of the inertial, $m$, and gravitational, $m_g$, masses and was tested in
numerous occasions with normal matter at relatively low energies. However,
there is no proof for the matter and antimatter at high energies. For the
antimatter the situation is even less clear -- current direct observations of
trapped antihydrogen suggest the limits $-65 < m_g / m < 110$ not excluding the
so-called antigravity phenomenon, i.e. repulsion of the antimatter by Earth.
Here we demonstrate an indirect bound $0.96 < m_g/m < 1.04$ on the
gravitational mass of relativistic electrons and positrons coming from the
absence of the vacuum Cherenkov radiation at the Large Electron-Positron
Collider (LEP) and stability of photons at the Tevatron collider in presence of
the annual variations of the solar gravitational potential. Our result clearly
rules out the speculated antigravity. By considering the absolute potential of
the Local Supercluster (LS), we also predict the bounds $1 - 4\times 10^{-7} <
m_g/m < 1 + 2\times 10^{-7}$ for an electron and positron. Finally, we comment
on a possibility of performing complementary tests at the future International
Linear Collider (ILC) and Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).
