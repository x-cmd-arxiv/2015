have high atomic gas fractions (~50%) and star formation rates per stellar mass
consistent with some high redshift star forming galaxies. Many local LCBGs also
have clumpy morphologies, with clumps distributed across their disks. Although
rare, these galaxies appear to be similar to the clumpy star forming galaxies
commonly observed at z~1-3. Local LCBGs separate into three groups: 1.
Interacting galaxies (~20%); 2. Clumpy spirals (~40%); 3. Non-clumpy,
non-spirals with regular shapes and smaller effective radii and stellar masses
(~40%). It seems that the method of building up a high gas fraction, which then
triggers star formation, is not the same for all local LCBGs. This may lead to
a dichotomy in galaxy characteristics. We consider possible gas delivery
scenarios and suggest that clumpy spirals, preferentially located in clusters
and with companions, are smoothly accreting gas from tidally disrupted
companions and/or intracluster gas enriched by stripped satellites. Conversely,
as non-clumpy galaxies are preferentially located in the field and tend to be
isolated, we suggest clumpy, cold streams, which destroy galaxy disks and
prevent clump formation, as a likely gas delivery mechanism for these systems.
Other possibilities include smooth cold streams, a series of minor mergers, or
major interactions.

reproduced the energy dependence of the $K^+/\pi^+$ and $\Lambda/\pi^-$ ratios

interpretation of the data, the roll-over scheme, in which the scalar meson
field $\sigma$ has not reached the thermal equilibrium at freeze-out. The
rool-over scheme for the equilibration of the $\sigma$-field is based on the
inflation mechanism. The non-equilibrium evolution of the scalar field
influences the particle production, e.g. $K^+/\pi^+$, however, the fixing of

need a fresh look at the fundamental building blocks of face recognition. In
this paper we focus on the selection of a suitable signal representation and
better matching strategy for face identification. We demonstrate how Gabor
phase could be leveraged to improve the performance of face identification by
using the Block Matching method. Compared to the existing approaches, the
proposed method features much lower algorithmic complexity: face images are
only filtered by a single-scale Gabor filter pair and the matching is performed
between any pairs of face images at hand without involving any training
process. Benchmark evaluations show that the proposed approach is totally
comparable to and even better than state-of-the-art algorithms, which are
typically based on more features extracted from a large set of Gabor faces

today, e.g., from queueing theory, effective bandwidths, and network calculus.
The behavior during transient phases, on the other hand, is understood to a
much lesser extent as its analysis poses significant challenges. Considering
the majority of short-lived flows, transient effects that have diverse causes,
such as TCP slow start, sleep scheduling in wireless networks, or signalling in
cellular networks, are, however, predominant. This paper contributes a general
model of regenerative service processes to characterize the transient behavior
of systems. The model leads to a notion of non-stationary service curves that
can be conveniently integrated into the framework of the stochastic network
calculus. We derive respective models of sleep scheduling and show the
significant impact of transient phases on backlogs and delays. We also consider
measurement methods that estimate the service of an unknown system from
observations of selected probe traffic. We find that the prevailing rate
scanning method does not recover the service during transient phases well. This
limitation is fundamental as it is explained by the non-convexity of
non-stationary service curves. A second key difficulty is proven to be due to
the super-additivity of network service processes. We devise a novel two-phase
probing technique that first determines a minimal pattern of probe traffic.
This probe is used to obtain an accurate estimate of the unknown transient
service.

doing so, we evaluate the Jacobians induced by finite BRST-antiBRST
transformations linear in functionally-dependent parameters, as well as those
induced by finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with arbitrary functional
parameters. The calculations cover the cases of gauge theories with a closed
algebra, dynamical systems with first-class constraints, and general gauge
theories. The resulting Jacobians in the case of linearized transformations are
different from those in the case of polynomial dependence on the parameters.
Finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with arbitrary parameters induce an extra
contribution to the quantum action, which cannot be absorbed into a change of
the gauge. These transformations include an extended case of
functionally-dependent parameters that implies a modified compensation
equation, which admits non-trivial solutions leading to a Jacobian equal to
unity. Finite BRST-antiBRST transformations with functionally-dependent
parameters are applied to the Standard Model, and an explicit form of
functionally-dependent parameters $\lambda_{a}$ is obtained, providing the
equivalence of path integrals in any $3$-parameter $R_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}$-like
gauges. The Gribov--Zwanziger theory is extended to the case of the Standard
Model, and a form of the Gribov horizon functional is suggested in the Landau
gauge, as well as in $R_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}$-like gauges, in a gauge-independent
way using field-dependent BRST-antiBRST transformations, and in
$R_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}$-like gauges using transverse-like non-Abelian gauge

informal markets, such as the OTC (over-the-counter) derivative market,
institutions only report their aggregated quarterly risk exposure, but no
details about their counterparties. Hence, little is known about the
diversification of counterparty risk. In this paper, we reconstruct the
weighted and time-dependent network of counterparty risk in the OTC derivatives
market of the United States between 1998 and 2012. To proxy unknown bilateral
exposures, we first study the co-occurrence patterns of institutions based on
their quarterly activity and ranking in the official report. The network
obtained this way is further analysed by a weighted k-core decomposition, to
reveal a core-periphery structure. This allows us to compare the activity-based
ranking with a topology-based ranking, to identify the most important
institutions and their mutual dependencies. We also analyse correlations in
these activities, to show strong similarities in the behavior of the core
institutions. Our analysis clearly demonstrates the clustering of counterparty
risk in a small set of about a dozen US banks. This not only increases the
default risk of the central institutions, but also the default risk of
peripheral institutions which have contracts with the central ones. Hence, all
institutions indirectly have to bear (part of) the counterparty risk of all
others, which needs to be better reflected in the price of OTC derivatives.

and demonstrate in the context of two different models, that the presence of
the Ricci scalar in the theory at early times, when the curvature is strong,
does not affect the actual cosmological solutions. By considering therefore a
pure scalar-GB theory with a quadratic coupling function we derive a plethora
of interesting, analytic solutions: for a negative coupling parameter, we
obtain inflationary, de Sitter-type solutions or expanding solutions with a de
Sitter phase in their past and a natural exit mechanism at later times; for a
positive coupling function, we find instead singularity-free solutions with no
Big-Bang singularity. We show that the aforementioned solutions arise only for
this particular choice of coupling function, a result that may hint to some
fundamental role that this coupling function may hold in the context of an
ultimate theory.

of H2O ice and a dark, potentially carbon-rich, constituent, along with CO2
ice. At the mean heliocentric distance of the Uranian system, native CO2 ice
should be removed on timescales shorter than the age of the Solar System.
Consequently, the detected CO2 ice might be actively produced. Analogous to
irradiation of icy moons in the Jupiter and Saturn systems, we hypothesize that
charged particles caught in Uranus' magnetic field bombard the surfaces of the
Uranian satellites, driving a radiolytic CO2 production cycle. To test this
hypothesis, we investigated the distribution of CO2 ice by analyzing
near-infrared (NIR) spectra of these moons, gathered using the SpeX
spectrograph at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) (2000 - 2013).
Additionally, we made spectrophotometric measurements using images gathered by
the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (2003 -
2005). We find that the detected CO2 ice is primarily on the trailing
hemispheres of the satellites closest to Uranus, consistent with other
observations of these moons. Our band parameter analysis indicates that the
detected CO2 ice is pure and segregated from other constituents. Our
spectrophotometric analysis indicates that IRAC is not sensitive to the CO2 ice
detected by SpeX, potentially because CO2 is retained beneath a thin surface
layer dominated by H2O ice that is opaque to photons over IRAC wavelengths.
Thus, our combined SpeX and IRAC analyses suggest that the near-surfaces (i.e.,
top few 100 microns) of the Uranian satellites are compositionally stratified.
We briefly compare the spectral characteristics of the CO2 ice detected on the
Uranian moons to icy satellites elsewhere, and we also consider the most likely
drivers of the observed distribution of CO2 ice.

there is a sign reversal of the currents as a consequence of the periodic

(cost) functions with real-valued scalar input/ouput. In particular, the goal
is to optimize a global cost function $\frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}|}\sum_{i\in
\mathcal{N}} h_i(x)$, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the set of non-faulty agents, and
$h_i(x)$ is agent $i$'s local cost function, which is initially known only to
agent $i$. In general, when some of the agents may be Byzantine faulty, the
above goal is unachievable, because the identity of the faulty agents is not
necessarily known to the non-faulty agents, and the faulty agents may behave
arbitrarily. Since the above global cost function cannot be optimized exactly
in presence of Byzantine agents, we define a weaker version of the problem.
  The goal for the weaker problem is to generate an output that is an optimum
of a function formed as a convex combination of local cost functions of the
non-faulty agents. More precisely, for some choice of weights $\alpha_i$ for
$i\in \mathcal{N}$ such that $\alpha_i\geq 0$ and $\sum_{i\in

$\alpha_i=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}|}$ for all $i\in \mathcal{N}$ -- however, this
cannot be guaranteed due to the presence of faulty agents. In fact, we show
that the maximum achievable number of nonzero weights ($\alpha_i$'s) is
$|\mathcal{N}|-f$, where $f$ is the upper bound on the number of Byzantine
agents. In addition, we present algorithms that ensure that at least
$|\mathcal{N}|-f$ agents have weights that are bounded away from 0. We also
propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which ensures that at least
$\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil-\phi$ agents have weights that are bounded away from
0, where $n$ is the total number of agents, and $\phi$ ($\phi\le f$) is the

resonant peak of the imaginary part of the DSS as a function of the frequency

subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients
in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient MCMC samplers
have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of
dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic
gradient noise is non-trivial. Even with simple dynamics, significant physical
intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the
stochastic gradient noise. In this paper, we provide a general recipe for
constructing MCMC samplers--including stochastic gradient versions--based on
continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices. We constructively prove
that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that
provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework.
We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially ""reinvented""
in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise
use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler:
stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC). Our experiments

predicts a unimodal distribution in specific star formation, in contrast to the

While there has been much progress on understanding complex networks over the
past decade, little is known about the regularities governing the
micro-dynamics of social networks. Here we explore the dynamic social network
of a densely-connected population of approximately 1000 individuals and their
interactions in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured
via Bluetooth, as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media
contacts, geo-location, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow
us to observe social groups directly, rendering community detection
unnecessary. Starting from 5-minute time slices we uncover dynamic social
structures expressed on multiple timescales. On the hourly timescale, we find
that gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a
stable core of individuals. Each core represents a social context. Cores
exhibit a pattern of recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with
varying degrees of regularity. Taken together, these findings provide a
powerful simplification of the social network, where cores represent
fundamental structures expressed with strong temporal and spatial regularity.
Using this framework, we explore the complex interplay between social and
geospatial behavior, documenting how the formation of cores are preceded by
coordination behavior in the communication networks, and demonstrating that
social behavior can be predicted with high precision.

Stacking arrangments different from the ground state structure in both bilayer

zigzag direction and results in larger hole effective masses. The optical gap
of bilayer (trilayer) black phosphorus varies by 0.4 (0.6) eV when changing the

the observation of the optical excitation of bound excitons within the

function is given by the function $f$ on $n=2^k$ bits defined by a complete
binary tree of NAND gates of depth $k$, which achieves $R_0(f) =
O(D(f)^{0.7537\ldots})$. We show this is false by giving an example of a total
boolean function $f$ on $n$ bits whose deterministic query complexity is
$\Omega(n/\log(n))$ while its zero-error randomized query complexity is $\tilde
O(\sqrt{n})$. We further show that the quantum query complexity of the same
function is $\tilde O(n^{1/4})$, giving the first example of a total function
with a super-quadratic gap between its quantum and deterministic query
complexities.
  We also construct a total boolean function $g$ on $n$ variables that has
zero-error randomized query complexity $\Omega(n/\log(n))$ and bounded-error
randomized query complexity $R(g) = \tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. This is the first
super-linear separation between these two complexity measures. The exact
quantum query complexity of the same function is $Q_E(g) = \tilde O(\sqrt{n})$.
  These two functions show that the relations $D(f) = O(R_1(f)^2)$ and $R_0(f)
= \tilde O(R(f)^2)$ are optimal, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Further
variations of these functions give additional separations between other query
complexity measures: a cubic separation between $Q$ and $R_0$, a $3/2$-power
separation between $Q_E$ and $R$, and a 4th power separation between
approximate degree and bounded-error randomized query complexity.
  All of these examples are variants of a function recently introduced by
\goos, Pitassi, and Watson which they used to separate the unambiguous
1-certificate complexity from deterministic query complexity and to resolve the
famous Clique versus Independent Set problem in communication complexity.

their expressive representation power and the ability of ancestral sampling.
One major difficulty of learning directed models with many latent variables is
the intractable inference. To address this problem, most existing algorithms
make assumptions to render the latent variables independent of each other,
either by designing specific priors, or by approximating the true posterior
using a factorized distribution. We believe the correlations among latent
variables are crucial for faithful data representation. Driven by this idea, we
propose an inference method based on the conditional pseudo-likelihood that
preserves the dependencies among the latent variables. For learning, we propose
to employ the hard Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which avoids the
intractability of the traditional EM by max-out instead of sum-out to compute
the data likelihood. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our model
against state of the art deep models on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in data representation and
reconstruction.

universal intermediate asymptotic, we derive a self-similar solution for an
ultra-relativistic jetted blast wave. The solution involves three distinct
regions: an approximately paraboloid head where the Lorentz factor $\gamma$
exceeds $\sim1/2$ of its maximal, nose value; a geometrically self-similar,
expanding envelope slightly narrower than a paraboloid; and an axial core in
which the (cylindrically, henceforth) radial flow $u$ converges inward towards
the axis. Most ($\sim 80\%$) of the energy lies well beyond the leading, head
region. Here, a radial cross section shows a maximal $\gamma$ (separating the
core and the envelope), a sign reversal in $u$, and a minimal $\gamma$, at
respectively $\sim 1/6$, $\sim1/4$, and $\sim3/4$ of the shock radius. The
solution is apparently unique, and approximately agrees with previous
simulations, of different initial conditions, that resolved the head. This
suggests that unlike a spherical relativistic blast wave, our solution is an
attractor, and may thus describe directed blast waves such as in the external
shock phase of a $\gamma$-ray burst.

computational performance in a class of black hole perturbation and
gravitational self-force calculations involving extreme mass ratios and generic

widespread future use in problems that entail (i) point-particle description of
the small compact object, (ii) frequency domain decomposition, and (iii) use of
the background eccentric geodesic motion. Frequency domain approaches are
widely used in both perturbation theory flux-balance calculations and in local
gravitational self-force calculations. Recent self-force calculations in Lorenz
gauge, using the frequency domain and method of extended homogeneous solutions,
have been able to accurately reach eccentricities as high as $e \simeq 0.7$. We
show here SSI successfully applied to Lorenz gauge. In a double precision
Lorenz gauge code, SSI enhances the accuracy of results and makes a factor of
three improvement in the overall speed. The primary initial application of
SSI--for us its \emph{raison d'\^{e}tre}--is in an arbitrary precision
\emph{Mathematica} code that computes perturbations of eccentric orbits in the
Regge-Wheeler gauge to extraordinarily high accuracy (e.g., 200 decimal
places). These high accuracy eccentric orbit calculations would not be possible
without the exponential convergence of SSI. We believe the method will extend
to work for inspirals on Kerr, and will be the subject of a later publication.
SSI borrows concepts from discrete-time signal processing and is used to
calculate the mode normalization coefficients in perturbation theory via sums
over modest numbers of points around an orbit. A variant of the idea is used to
obtain spectral accuracy in solution of the geodesic orbital motion.

features of general relativity. In quantum gravity, in particular spin foams,
matter couplings have been defined in the past, yet the mutual dynamics, in
particular if matter and gravity are strongly coupled, are hardly explored,
which is related to the definition of both matter and gravitational degrees of
freedom on the discretisation. However extracting this mutual dynamics is
crucial in testing the viability of the spin foam approach and also
establishing connections to other discrete approaches such as lattice gauge
theories.
  Therefore, we introduce a simple 2D toy model for Yang--Mills coupled to spin
foams, namely an Ising model coupled to so--called intertwiner models defined
for $\text{SU}(2)_k$. The two systems are coupled by choosing the Ising
coupling constant to depend on spin labels of the background, as these are
interpreted as the edge lengths of the discretisation. We coarse grain this toy
model via tensor network renormalization and uncover an interesting dynamics:
the Ising phase transition temperature turns out to be sensitive to the
background configurations and conversely, the Ising model can induce phase

10^{9-10} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) are already in place less than $1 \,
\mathrm{Gyr}$ after the Big Bang poses stringent time constraints on the growth
efficiency of their seeds. Among proposed possibilities, the formation of
massive ($\sim 10^{3-6} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) seeds and/or the occurrence of
super-Eddington ($\dot{M}>\dot{M}_{Edd}$) accretion episodes may contribute to
the solution of this problem. In this work we analytically and numerically
investigate the accretion flow onto high-redshift ($z \sim 10$) black holes to
understand the physical requirements favoring rapid and efficient growth. Our
model identifies a ""feeding-dominated"" accretion regime and a
""feedback-limited"" one, the latter being characterized by intermittent (duty
cycles ${\cal D} \lesssim 0.5$) and inefficient growth, with recurring outflow
episodes. We find that low-mass seeds ($\lesssim 10^{3-4} \,
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) evolve in the feedback-limited regime, while more massive
seeds ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) grow very rapidly as they are
found in the feeding-dominated regime. In addition to the standard accretion
model with a fixed matter-energy conversion factor ($\epsilon = 0.1$), we have
also explored slim disk models, appropriate for super-Eddington accretion,
where radiation is trapped in the disk and the radiative efficiency is reduced
($\epsilon \lesssim 0.04$), which may ensure a continuous growth with $\dot{M}
\gg \dot{M}_{Edd}$ (up to $\sim 300\dot{M}_{Edd}$ in our simulations). Under
these conditions, outflows play a negligible role and a black hole can accrete
$80\%-100\%$ of the gas mass of the host halo ($\sim 10^7 \,
\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) in $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Myr}$, while in feedback-limited
systems we predict that black holes can accrete only up to $\sim 15\%$ of the
available mass.

that the accretion disc radius, measured from the double-peaked emission line
profiles, is persistently large and lies within the range of 0.45-0.52a, where
a is the binary separation. This is close to the tidal truncation radius
r_max=0.52a. This result contradicts with previous radius measurements. An
extensive set of Doppler maps has revealed a very complex emission structure of
the accretion disc. Apart from a ring of disc emission, the tomograms display
at least three areas of enhanced emission: the hot spot from the area of
interaction between the gas stream and the disc, which is superposed on the
elongated spiral structure, and the extended bright region on the leading side
of the disc, opposite to the location of the hot spot. The position of the hot
spot in all the emission lines is consistent with the trajectory of the gas
stream. However, the peaks of emission are located in the range of distances
0.22-0.30a, which are much closer to the white dwarf than the disc edge. This
suggests that the outer disc regions have a very low density, allowing the gas
stream to flow almost freely before it starts to be seen as an emission source.
We have found that the extended emission region in the leading side of the disc
is always observed at the very edge of the large disc. Observations of other
cataclysmic variables, which show a similar emission structure in their
tomograms, confirm this conclusion. We propose that the leading side bright
region is caused by irradiation of tidally thickened sectors of the outer disc
by the white dwarf and/or hot inner disc regions.

outward forming the jet, is a natural site of pair formation and particle
acceleration. This occurs via an inverse-Compton pair catastrophe driven by
unscreened electric fields within the charge-starved region about the
stagnation surface and substantially amplified by a post-gap cascade. For
typical estimates of the jet properties in M87, we find excellent quantitive
agreement between the predicted relativistic lepton densities and those
required by recent high-frequency radio observations of M87. This mechanism
fails to adequately fill a putative jet from Sagittarius A* with relativistic
leptons, which may explain the lack of an obvious radio jet in the Galactic
center. Finally, this process implies a relationship between the kinetic jet
power and the gamma-ray luminosity of blazars, produced during the post-gap

about 4' (160 kpc) long, extending to a bright hotspot. These images are the
first optical detections of this jet, and by extracting knot flux densities
through three filters we set constraints on emission models. While the radio

are several emission mechanisms which might be used to explain the X-ray flux
densities. Our data rule out Doppler boosted inverse Compton scattering as a
source of the high energy emission. Instead, we find that the observed emission
can be well described by synchrotron emission from electrons with a low energy
index ($p\sim2$) that dominates the radio band, while a high energy index
($p\sim3$) is needed for the X-ray band and the transition occurs in the
optical/infrared band. This model is consistent with a continuous electron

large and attractive, although all small excited states are unstable. We prove
that the set of initial data for which solutions scatter to any one unstable

unique, center-stable manifold associated with, but not necessarily close to,
any unstable steady state. In particular, the set of data for which solutions

visibility function in satellite-based Earth observation with passive
radiometers does not take into account the relative motion of the observer (the
satellite antenna) with respect to sources of the electro-magnetic fields at
the surface of the Earth. The motion of the observer leads on the one hand to a
more complex signal due to a pixel-dependent Doppler shift that is neglected in
the standard derivation of the Van Cittert--Zernike theorem, but on the other
hand one may hope that it could be employed for a temporal aperture synthesis,
where virtual baselines are created through the motion of the satellite. Here,
we generalize the formulation of the aperture synthesis concept to the case of
observers moving with respect to the sources, and to the correlation of fields
measured at times that differ by the travel time of the observer along a
virtual baseline. Our derivation is based on first principles, starting with
the wave propagation in the Earth reference frame of electro-magnetic fields
arising from incoherent current sources, and Lorentz transforming the fields
into the reference frame of the satellite. Our detailed study leads to the
remarkable conclusion that the delay time due to observer motion cancels
exactly the Doppler effect. This justifies the neglect of the Doppler effect in

particular we focus on the polar precession of spins and the possibility of a
complete flip of spins with respect to the orbital plane. We perform a full
numerical simulation that displays these characteristics. We evolve equal mass
binary spinning black holes for $t=20,000M$ from an initial proper separation
of $d=25M$ down to merger after 48.5 orbits. We compute the gravitational
radiation from this system and compare it to 3.5 post-Newtonian generated

evolutions to show the extension of this spin {flip-flop} phenomenon to unequal
mass binaries. We also provide analytic expressions to approximate the maximum
{flip-flop} angle and frequency in terms of the binary spins and mass ratio
parameters at a given orbital radius. Finally we discuss the effect this spin
{flip-flop} would have on accreting matter and other potential observational

space $\mathcal{H}$ from $m$ measurements obtained through known linear
functionals on $\mathcal{H}$. Problems of this type are well studied \cite{MRW}
under an assumption that $u$ belongs to a prescribed model class, e.g. a known
compact subset of $\mathcal{H}$. Motivated by reduced modeling for parametric
partial differential equations, this paper considers another setting where the
additional information about $u$ is in the form of how well $u$ can be
approximated by a certain known subspace $V_n$ of $\mathcal{H}$ of dimension
$n$, or more generally, how well $u$ can be approximated by each
$k$-dimensional subspace $V_k$ of a sequence of nested subspaces $V_0\subset
V_1\cdots\subset V_n$. A recovery algorithm for the one-space formulation,
proposed in \cite{MPPY}, is proven here to be optimal and to have a simple
formulation, if certain favorable bases are chosen to represent $V_n$ and the
measurements. The major contribution of the present paper is to analyze the
multi-space case for which it is shown that the set of all $u$ satisfying the
given information can be described as the intersection of a family of known
ellipsoids in $\mathcal{H}$. It follows that a near optimal recovery algorithm
in the multi-space problem is to identify any point in this intersection which
can provide a much better accuracy than in the one-space problem. Two iterative
algorithms based on alternating projections are proposed for recovery in the
multi-space problem. A detailed analysis of one of them provides a posteriori
performance estimates for the iterates, stopping criteria, and convergence
rates. Since the limit of the algorithm is a point in the intersection of the
aforementioned ellipsoids, it provides a near optimal recovery for $u$.

receiver comprises a single feed horn, a waveguide circular polarizer, an
orthomode transducer (OMT), two heterodyne mixers, and two low-noise amplifiers

of polarization observations, describe the construction and performance of key
receiver components (circular polarizer, OMT, and mixers -- but not the

the calibration of the R-L phase offsets and the polarization leakage

3C286, we find a polarization position angle of $\chi = 39.2 \pm 1^{\circ}$ for
3C286 at 225 GHz, consistent with other observations at millimeter wavelengths.

quantum mechanical density matrices. The SDM approximation of a PDF satisfies
the normalization condition and is nonnegative everywhere in contrast to the
truncated Gram-Charlier and Edgeworth expansions. For bases with an algebraic
structure, such as the Hermite polynomial and Fourier bases, the SDM

to an ordinary differential equation for the SDM dynamics of the approximating

each exposure. The corrections potentially reduce the systematics for any
studies of BOSS quasars, including the measurement of baryon acoustic
oscillations using the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Our model suggests that, on
average, the observed quasar flux in BOSS is overestimated by $\sim 19\%$ at
3600 \AA\ and underestimated by $\sim 24\%$ at 10,000 \AA. Our corrections for
the entire BOSS quasar sample are publicly available.

linear models (GLMs) for the astronomical community, we elucidate the potential
of the class of GLMs which handles count data. The size of a galaxy's globular
cluster population $N_{\rm GC}$ is a prolonged puzzle in the astronomical
literature. It falls in the category of count data analysis, yet it is usually
modelled as if it were a continuous response variable. We have developed a
Bayesian negative binomial regression model to study the connection between
$N_{\rm GC}$ and the following galaxy properties: central black hole mass,
dynamical bulge mass, bulge velocity dispersion, and absolute visual magnitude.
The methodology introduced herein naturally accounts for heteroscedasticity,
intrinsic scatter, errors in measurements in both axes (either discrete or
continuous), and allows modelling the population of globular clusters on their
natural scale as a non-negative integer variable. Prediction intervals of 99%
around the trend for expected $N_{\rm GC}$comfortably envelope the data,
notably including the Milky Way, which has hitherto been considered a
problematic outlier. Finally, we demonstrate how random intercept models can
incorporate information of each particular galaxy morphological type. Bayesian
variable selection methodology allows for automatically identifying galaxy
types with different productions of GCs, suggesting that on average S0 galaxies
have a GC population 35% smaller than other types with similar brightness.

many-particle systems is computationally demanding when no macroscopic model
for the dynamics of the variables of interest is available. In case
observations on the macroscopic scale can only be produced via legacy simulator
code or live experiments, finding a model for these macroscopic variables is
challenging.
  In this paper, we employ time-lagged embedding theory to construct
macroscopic numerical models from output data of a black box, such as a
simulator or live experiments. Since the state space variables of the
constructed, coarse model are dynamically closed and observable by an
observation function, we call these variables closed observables. The approach
is an online-offline procedure, as model construction from observation data is
performed offline and the new model can then be used in an online phase,
independent of the original. We illustrate the theoretical findings with
numerical models constructed from time series of a two-dimensional ordinary
differential equation system, and from the density evolution of a
transport-diffusion system. Applicability is demonstrated in a real-world
example, where passengers leave a train and the macroscopic model for the
density flow onto the platform is constructed with our approach. If only the
macroscopic variables are of interest, simulation runtimes with the numerical
model are three orders of magnitude lower compared to simulations with the
original fine scale model. We conclude with a brief discussion of possibilities
of numerical model construction in systematic upscaling, network optimization
and uncertainty quantification.

in several ways. They can ionize nearby halos, and even if their ionizing
photons are trapped by their own halos, their Lyman-Werner (LW) photons can
still escape and destroy H$_2$ in other halos, preventing them from cooling and
forming stars. LW escape fractions are thus a key parameter in cosmological
simulations of early reionization and star formation but have not yet been
parametrized for realistic halos by halo or stellar mass. To do so, we perform
radiation hydrodynamical simulations of LW UV escape from 9--120 M$_{\odot}$
Pop III stars in $10^5$ to $10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ halos with ZEUS-MP. We find that
photons in the LW lines (i.e. those responsible for destroying H$_{2}$ in
nearby systems) have escape fractions ranging from 0% to 85%. No LW photons
escape the most massive halo in our sample, even from the most massive star.
Escape fractions for photons elsewhere in the 11.18--13.6~eV energy range,
which can be redshifted into the LW lines at cosmological distances, are
generally much higher, being above 60% for all but the least massive stars in
the most massive halos. We find that shielding of H$_2$ by neutral hydrogen,
which has been neglected in most studies to date, produces escape fractions
that are up to a factor of three smaller than those predicted by H$_2$
self-shielding alone.

morphological data from extant and fossil species to infer phylogenetic
relationships, species divergence times, and macroevolutionary parameters in a
single coherent framework. Current model-based implementations of this approach
lack an appropriate model for the tree describing the diversification and
fossilization process and can produce estimates that lead to erroneous
conclusions. We address this shortcoming by providing a total-evidence method
implemented in a Bayesian framework. This approach uses a mechanistic tree
prior to describe the underlying diversification process that generated the
tree of extant and fossil taxa. Previous attempts to apply the total-evidence
approach have used tree priors that do not account for the possibility that
fossil samples may be direct ancestors of other samples. The fossilized
birth-death (FBD) process explicitly models the diversification, fossilization,
and sampling processes and naturally allows for sampled ancestors. This model
was recently applied to estimate divergence times based on molecular data and
fossil occurrence dates. We incorporate the FBD model and a model of
morphological trait evolution into a Bayesian total-evidence approach to dating
species phylogenies. We apply this method to extant and fossil penguins and
show that the modern penguins radiated much more recently than has been
previously estimated, with the basal divergence in the crown clade occurring at
~12.7 Ma and most splits leading to extant species occurring in the last 2
million years. Our results demonstrate that including stem-fossil diversity can
greatly improve the estimates of the divergence times of crown taxa. The method

the media content to adapt to the desired display sizes. For various layouts of
web pages and typically small sizes of handheld portable devices, the
importance in the original image content gets obfuscated after resizing it with
the approach of uniform scaling. Thus, there occurs a need for resizing the
images in a content aware manner which can automatically discard irrelevant
information from the image and present the salient features with more
magnitude. There have been proposed some image retargeting techniques keeping
in mind the content awareness of the input image. However, these techniques
fail to prove globally effective for various kinds of images and desired sizes.
The major problem is the inefficiency of these algorithms to process these
images with minimal visual distortion while also retaining the meaning conveyed
from the image. In this dissertation, we present a novel perspective for
content aware image retargeting, which is well implementable in real time. We
introduce a novel method of analysing semantic information within the input

magnetic phases that result from the indirect spin-spin coupling mediated by
the electrons is determined as a function of density and the spin-fermion
coupling $J$. At a fixed chemical potential, spiral phases exist only up to
values of $J$ which are less than roughly half the electronic bandwidth. At a
fixed electron density and near half filling, the system phase separates into a
half-filled antiferromagnetic phase and a spiral phase. The ferromagnetic

weak pairing field $\Delta$ but disappears when $\Delta$ exceeds a critical

Jet
substructure is essentially determined by QCD radiations and non-perturbative
effects. Predictions of jet substructure are usually different among Monte
Carlo event generators, and are governed by the parton shower algorithm
implemented. For leading logarithmic parton shower, even though one of the core
variables is the evolution variable, its choice is not unique. We examine
evolution variable dependence of the jet substructure by developing a parton
shower generator that interpolates between different evolution variables using
a parameter $\alpha$. Jet shape variables and associated jet rates for quark
and gluon jets are used to demonstrate the $\alpha$-dependence of the jet
substructure. We find angular ordered shower predicts wider jets, while
relative transverse momentum ($p_{\bot}$) ordered shower predicts narrower
jets. This is qualitatively in agreement with the missing phase space of
$p_{\bot}$ ordered showers. Such difference can be reduced by tuning other
parameters of the showering algorithm, especially in the low energy region,
while the difference tends to increase for high energy jets.

variations, with high rates around Hellas basin and west of Tharsis but low
rates around Margaritifer Sinus (where the observed valley network drainage
density is nonetheless high). In the cold and icy scenario, snow migration is a
function of both obliquity and surface pressure, and limited episodic melting
is possible through combinations of seasonal, volcanic and impact forcing. At
surface pressures above those required to avoid atmospheric collapse (~0.5 bar)
and moderate to high obliquity, snow is transported to the equatorial highland
regions where the concentration of valley networks is highest. Snow
accumulation in the Aeolis quadrangle is high, indicating an ice-free northern
ocean is not required to supply water to Gale crater. At lower surface
pressures and obliquities, both H2O and CO2 are trapped as ice at the poles and
the equatorial regions become extremely dry. The valley network distribution is
positively correlated with snow accumulation produced by the cold and icy
simulation at 41.8 degrees obliquity but uncorrelated with precipitation
produced by the warm and wet simulation. Because our simulations make specific
predictions for precipitation patterns under different climate scenarios, they

This specific type of naked singularity was characterized in 2008 by Virbhadra
and Keeton. The lens is described using the Janis-Newman-Winicour metric, which
has an ordinary mass and massless scalar charge parameters. Gravitational
lensing by the SNS gives rise to 4 images: 2 images on the same side as the
source and 2 images on the opposite side of the source from the optic axis. We
compute magnification centroid, magnification centroid shift, and total
absolute magnification for many values of the angular source position. The
nature of the curve for all three results are qualitatively similar to
Schwarzschild black hole lenses, but quantitatively different. Magnification
centroid increases as angular source position increases. As angular source
position increases, magnification centroid shift increases to a maximum value,
and then begins to decrease. As angular source position becomes large,
magnification centroid shift will approach zero. Total magnification is large
for small values of angular source position, and decreases to a limiting value
of one. The results expand upon previous work on an SNS of {\nu}=0.01. If such
observations were viewed experimentally, they would show support for an SNS at
the galactic center. Interpretation of an SNS would disprove the cosmic
censorship hypothesis by Penrose, as well as the weaker cosmic censorship
hypothesis by Virbhadra, which allows the existence of weakly naked
singularities.

aggregators' positions are fixed so highly directional antennas are employed,
(ii) secondary users transmit with limited power in relation to the primary,
(iii) meters' transmissions are coordinated to avoid packet collisions, and
(iv) the secondary links' robustness is guaranteed by an outage constraint.
Under these assumptions, the interference caused by secondary users in both
primary (base-stations) and other secondary users can be neglected. As
unlicensed users, however, meter-aggregator links do experience interference
from the mobile users of the primary network, whose positions and traffic
activity are unknown. To cope with this uncertainty, we model the mobile users
spatial distribution as a Poisson point process. We then derive a closed-form
solution for the maximum achievable throughput with respect to a reference
secondary link subject to transmit power and outage constraints. Our numerical
results illustrate the effects of such constraints on the optimal throughput,
evincing that more frequent outage events improve the system performance in the

have little effect on the reconstruction of the average power demand curve that

and, undoubtedly, is the most successful physical theory we have to date.
However, since its foundation about a century ago, it has been uninterruptedly
the center of harsh debates ignited by the counterintuitive character of some
of its predictions. The subject of one of these heated discussions is the
so-called ""retrodiction paradox"", namely a deceptive inconsistency of quantum
mechanics which is often associated with the ""measurement paradox"" and the
""collapse of the wave function""; it comes from the apparent time-asymmetry
between state preparation and measurement. Actually, in the literature one
finds several versions of the retrodiction paradox; however, a particularly
insightful one was presented by Sir Roger Penrose in his seminal book \emph{The
Road to Reality}. Here, we address the question to what degree Penrose's
retrodiction paradox occurs in the classical and quantum domain. We achieve a
twofold result. First, we show that Penrose's paradox manifests itself in some
form also in classical optics. Second, we demonstrate that when information is
correctly extracted from the measurements and the quantum-mechanical formalism
is properly applied, Penrose's retrodiction paradox does not manifest itself in
quantum optics.

the dipole polarizability. We define a reference value for the polarizability,
to remove a trivial dependence on the mass number. We compare our results with

  Our results support the presence of a strong isoscalar transition, with
little or moderate E1 strength, as a universal feature of ordinary nuclei. In
moderately neutron-rich Ni isotopes, namely 68Ni and neighboring isotopes, this
transition is found bimodal due to couplings with surface neutrons. An adequate
treatment of the continuum states appears essential for describing
suprathreshold E1 strength, especially beyond 68Ni. Very exotic isotopes (N>50)
are found highly polarizable, with practically all their E1 strength in the
continuum. The dipole polarizability and the neutron skin thickness are
influenced by shell structure in different ways, so they can appear
anticorrelated. A comparison with existing results for lighter (Ca) and heavier

strongly by shell effects and that, partly for that reason, its isospin

networks inferred from healthy controls and patients can lead to the discovery
of biological pathways associated to the disease. As a cancer progresses, its
signalling and control networks are subject to some degree of localised
re-wiring. Being able to detect disrupted interaction patterns induced by the
presence or progression of the disease can lead to the discovery of novel
molecular diagnostic and prognostic signatures. Currently there is a lack of
scalable statistical procedures for two-network comparisons aimed at detecting
localised topological differences. We propose the dGHD algorithm, a methodology
for detecting differential interaction patterns in two-network comparisons. The
algorithm relies on a statistic, the Generalised Hamming Distance (GHD), for
assessing the degree of topological difference between networks and evaluating
its statistical significance. dGHD builds on a non-parametric permutation
testing framework but achieves computationally efficiency through an asymptotic
normal approximation. We show that the GHD is able to detect more subtle
topological differences compared to a standard Hamming distance between
networks. This results in the dGHD algorithm achieving high performance in
simulation studies as measured by sensitivity and specificity. An application
to the problem of detecting differential DNA co-methylation subnetworks
associated to ovarian cancer demonstrates the potential benefits of the
proposed methodology for discovering network-derived biomarkers associated with
a trait of interest.

intense basic research. Un- derstanding nuclear fission, apart from a
theoretical point of view, is of practical importance for energy production and
the transmutation of nuclear waste. In nuclear astrophysics, fission sets the
upper limit to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements via the r-process. In this
work we initiated a systematic study of intermediate energy proton-induced
fission using the Constrained Molecu- lar Dynamics (CoMD) code. The CoMD code
implements an effective interaction with a nuclear matter compressibility of
K=200 (soft EOS) with several forms of the density dependence of the
nucleon-nucleon symmetry potential. Moreover, a constraint is imposed in the
phase-space occu- pation for each nucleon restoring the Pauli principle at each
time step of the collision. A proper choice of the surface parameter of the
effective interaction has been made to describe fission. In this work, we
present results of fission calculations for proton-induced reactions on : a)
232 Th at 27 and 63 MeV, b) 235 U at 10, 30, 60 and 100 MeV, and c) 238 U at
100 and 660 MeV. The calculated observables include fission-fragment mass
distributions, total fission energies, neutron multiplicities and fission
times. These observables are compared to available experimental data. We show
that the microscopic CoMD code is able to describe the complicated many-body
dynamics of the fission process at intermediate and high energy and give a
reasonable estimate of the fission time scale. Sensitivity of the results to
the density dependence of the nucleon symmetry potential (and, thus, the
nuclear symmetry energy) is found. Further improvements of the code are
necessary to achieve a satisfactory description of low energy fission in which
shell effects play a dominant role.

elasticity. In particular for covalent networks, the jump of specific heat is
small and the liquid is {\it strong} near the threshold valence where the
network acquires rigidity. By contrast, the jump of specific heat and the
fragility are large away from this threshold valence. In a previous work [Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110, 6307 (2013)], we could explain these behaviors by
introducing a model of supercooled liquids in which local rearrangements
interact via elasticity. However, in that model the disorder characterizing
elasticity was frozen, whereas it is itself a dynamic variable in supercooled
liquids. Here we study numerically and theoretically adaptive elastic network
models where polydisperse springs can move on a lattice, thus allowing for the
geometry of the elastic network to fluctuate and evolve with temperature. We
show numerically that our previous results on the relationship between
structure and thermodynamics hold in these models. We introduce an
approximation where redundant constraints (highly coordinated regions where the
frustration is large) are treated as an ideal gas, leading to analytical
predictions that are accurate in the range of parameters relevant for real
materials. Overall, these results lead to a description of supercooled liquids,
in which the distance to the rigidity transition controls the number of
directions in phase space that cost energy and the specific heat.

an impactor around 4.5 billion years ago. This impact could have been so
energetic that it could have mixed and homogenized the Earth's mantle. However,
this view appears to be inconsistent with geochemical studies that suggest that
the Earth's mantle was not mixed by the impact. Another plausible outcome is
that this energetic impact melted the whole mantle, but the extent of mantle
melting is not well understood even though it must have had a significant
effect on the subsequent evolution of the Earth's interior and atmosphere. To
understand the initial state of the Earth's mantle, we perform giant impact
simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for three different
models: (a) standard: a Mars-sized impactor hits the proto-Earth, (b)
fast-spinning Earth: a small impactor hits a rapidly rotating proto-Earth, and
(c) sub-Earths: two half Earth-sized planets collide. We use two types of
equations of state (MgSiO3 liquid and forsterite) to describe the Earth's
mantle. We find that the mantle remains unmixed in (a), but it may be mixed in
(b) and (c). The extent of mixing is most extensive in (c). Therefore, (a) is
most consistent and (c) may be least consistent with the preservation of the
mantle heterogeneity, while (b) may fall between. We determine that the Earth's
mantle becomes mostly molten by the impact in all of the models. The choice of
the equations of state does not affect these outcomes. Additionally, our
results indicate that entropy gains of the mantle materials by a giant impact
cannot be predicted well by the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. Moreover, we show
that the mantle can remain unmixed on a Moon-forming timescale if it does not
become mixed by the impact.

it reveals the correlations between the factors and the system status through

data correlations through large random matrices. Compared with model-based
methods, the proposed method is inspired by a pure statistical approach,
without a prior knowledge of operation and interaction mechanism models for
power systems and factors. In general, this method is direct in analysis,
robust against bad data, universal to various factors, and applicable for
real-time analysis. A case study, based on the standard IEEE 118-bus system,

functions on mode number analysis in magnetically confined fusion plasmas.
Magnetic probes mounted inside the vacuum chamber are widely used to
characterize the mode structure of magnetohydrodynamic modes, as, due to their
relative simplicity and compact nature, several coils can be distributed over
the vessel. Phase differences between the transfer functions of different
magnetic pick-up coils lead to systematic errors in time- and frequency
resolved mode number analysis. This paper presents the first in-situ,
end-to-end calibration of a magnetic pick-up coil system which was carried out
by using an in-vessel driving coil on ASDEX Upgrade. The effect of the phase
differences in the pick-up coil transfer functions is most significant in the
50-250 kHz frequency range, where the relative phase shift between the
different probes can be up to 1 radian (~60{\deg}). By applying a correction
based on the transfer functions we found smaller residuals of mode number
fitting in the considered discharges. In most cases an order of magnitude
improvement was observed in the residuals of the mode number fits, which could
open the way to investigate weaker electromagnetic oscillations with even high
mode numbers.

driving force of the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the

the usual, non-ferroelectric, polar material with a ferroelectric thin film and
use the ferroelectric polarization as the source for polar discontinuity. We
use ab initio simulations to systematically investigate the stability,
formation and properties of the two-dimensional free-carrier gases formed in
PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures under realistic mechanical and electrical
boundary conditions. Above a critical thickness, the ferroelectric layers can
be stabilized in the out-of-plane monodomain configuration due to the
electrostatic screening provided by the free-carriers. Our simulations also
predict that the system can be switched between three stable configurations
(polarization up, down or zero), allowing the non-volatile manipulation of the
free charge density and sign at the interface. Furthermore, the link between
ferroelectric polarization and free charge density demonstrated by our analysis
constitutes compelling support for the polar catastrophe model that is used to
rationalize the formation of 2DEG at oxide interfaces.

Fisher matrix approach in the case of Gaussianity. It works with the minimal
assumptions of having Gaussian errors on the data, and a covariance matrix that
possesses a converging Taylor approximation. The resulting approximation works
in cases of severe parameter degeneracies and in cases where the Fisher matrix
is singular. It is at least $1000$ times faster than a typical Monte Carlo
Markov Chain run over the same parameter space. Two example applications, to
cases of extremely non-Gaussian likelihoods, are presented -- one demonstrates
how the method succeeds in reconstructing completely a ring-shaped likelihood.

so-called fitted finite volume method to solve the HJB equation and the

illustrated by the numerical experiments. Under different conditions, the
equilibrium states as well as the effects of the emission permits price are

four historically characterised categories: 1) Historical, 2) Industrial, 3)

been investigated using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS) performed at the iridium L$_3$ edge and theoretical techniques. A study
of the systematic dependence of the RIXS spectrum on the orientation of the
wavevector transfer, $\mathbf{Q}$, with respect to the iridium-oxide bilayer
has revealed that the magnon dispersion is comprised of two branches well
separated in energy and gapped across the entire Brillouin zone. Our results
contrast with those of an earlier study which reported the existence of a
single dominant branch. While these earlier results were interpreted as two
overlapping modes within a spin-wave model of weakly coupled iridium-oxide
planes, our results are more reminiscent of those expected for a system of
weakly coupled dimers. In this latter approach the lower and higher energy
modes find a natural explanation as those corresponding to transverse and
longitudinal fluctuations, respectively. We have therefore developed a
bond-operator theory which describes the magnetic dispersion in
Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ in terms of quantum dimer excitations. In our model
dimerisation is produced by the leading Heisenberg exchange, $J_c$, which
couples iridium ions in adjacent planes of the bilayer. The Hamiltonian also
includes in plane exchange, $J$, as well as further neighbour couplings and
relevant anisotropies. The bond-operator theory provides an excellent account
of the dispersion of both modes, while the measured $\mathbf{Q}$ dependence of
the RIXS intensities is in reasonable qualitative accord with the spin-spin
correlation function calculated from the theory. We discuss our results in the
context of the quantum criticality of bilayer dimer systems in the presence of
anisotropic interactions derived from strong spin-orbit coupling.

needed in transport and urban planning. Several approaches have been considered
in the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the
number of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and
destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of
this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another
popular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which
argues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only
the role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between
them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two
approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them
against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different
countries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities
laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the
probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called
trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the
commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We
show that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities
laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network
and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting
commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different
approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since
their only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.

high-energy protons are accelerated in SNRs. The actual gamma-ray emission from

for efficient acceleration at least for particles with energies above 30 TeV

superdiffusive process (travel distance proportional to t^0.75) in our

renormalization-group (RG) methods and perform mean-field and numerical
calculations. The FT RG analysis is based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Phi4
theory with two complex scalar fields which has the same symmetry as the
bosonic system. In particular, for identical bosons with exchange Z_2,e
symmetry, coupled by effective density-density interactions, the global
symmetry is Z_2e X U(1) X U(1). At the BEC transition it may break into Z_2,e X
Z_2 X Z_2 when both components condense simultaneously, or to U(1) X Z_2 when
only one component condenses. This implies different universality classes for
the corresponding critical behaviors. Numerical simulations of the
two-component Bose-Hubbard model in the hard-core limit support the RG
prediction: when both components condense simultaneously, the critical behavior
is controlled by a decoupled XY fixed point, with unusual slowly-decaying
scaling corrections arising from the on-site inter-species interaction.

to reduce the influence of other signals unrelated to the corresponding

in time with respect to the corresponding stimulus or behaviour, averaging over
trials may distort the estimation of the underlying neuronal response. Here, we

show that the dTAV algorithm can reduce the jitter of neuronal responses for
signal to noise ratios of 0.2 or higher, i.e. in cases where the standard
deviation of the noise is up to five times larger than the neuronal response
amplitude. By removing the jitter and, therefore, enabling more accurate

history of planet formation, but have not yet been measured for evolved

perspective of the Rossiter-McLauglin effect during secondary eclipse (RMse)
ingress and egress for transiting exoplanets. Near secondary eclipse, when the
planet passes behind the parent star, the star sequentially obscures light from
the approaching and receding parts of the rotating planetary surface. The
temporal block of light emerging from the approaching (blue-shifted) or
receding (red-shifted) parts of the planet causes a temporal distortion in the
planet's spectral line profiles resulting in an anomaly in the planet's radial
velocity curve. We demonstrate that the shape and the ratio of the
ingress-to-egress radial velocity amplitudes depends on the planetary
rotational rate, axial tilt and impact factor (i.e. sky-projected planet
spin-orbital alignment). In addition, line asymmetries originating from
different layers in the atmosphere of the planet could provide information
regarding zonal atmospheric winds and constraints on the hot spot shape for
giant irradiated exoplanets. The effect is expected to be most-pronounced at
near-infrared wavelengths, where the planet-to-star contrasts are large. We
create synthetic near-infrared, high-dispersion spectroscopic data and
demonstrate how the sky-projected spin axis orientation and equatorial velocity
of the planet can be estimated. We conclude that the RMse effect could be a
powerful method to measure exoplanet spins.

small-scales fluctuations are sensitive only to the degree of mode-reduction,

such as electrical transport, high resolution transmission electron microscopy

this transparent conductor to a relative humidity up to $100 \%$ at room
temperature for 25 days, to a temperature up to $150\,^\circ$C in atmosphere
and up to a temperature as high as $620\,^\circ$C in vacuum, that is more than
twice higher than the temperature at which the intercalation is conducted. The
stability of FeCl$_3$ intercalated few-layer graphene together with its unique

structure implementations, despite its intuitive appeal is known to lead to
poor scalability. This disadvantage has led researchers to design scalable data
structures satisfying consistency conditions weaker than linearizability.
Despite this recent trend, sequential consistency as a strictly weaker
consistency condition than linearizability has received no interest.
  In this paper, we investigate the applicability of sequential consistency as
an alternative correctness criterion for concurrent data structure
implementations. Our first finding formally justifies the reluctance in moving
towards sequentially consistent data structures: Implementations in which each
thread modifies only its thread-local variables are sequentially consistent for
various standard data structures such as pools, queues and stacks. We also show
that for almost all data structures, and the data structures we consider in
this paper, it is possible to have sequentially consistent behaviors in which a
designated thread does not synchronize at all. As a potential remedy, we define
a hierarchy of quantitatively strengthened variants of sequential consistency
such that the stronger the variant the more synchronization it enforces which
at the limit is equal to that enforced by linearizability.

supports one of two parties and is either a susceptible voter or an inflexible
zealot. At each time step, a susceptible adopts the opinion of a neighbor if
this belongs to a group of $q\geq 2$ neighbors all in the same state, whereas
inflexible zealots never change their opinion. In the presence of zealots of
both parties the model is characterized by a fluctuating stationary state and,
below a zealotry density threshold, the distribution of opinions is bimodal.
After a characteristic time, most susceptibles become supporters of the party
having more zealots and the opinion distribution is asymmetric. When the number
of zealots of both parties is the same, the opinion distribution is symmetric
and, in the long run, susceptibles endlessly swing from the state where they
all support one party to the opposite state. Above the zealotry density
threshold, when there is an unequal number of zealots of each type, the
probability distribution is single-peaked and non-Gaussian. These properties
are investigated analytically and with stochastic simulations. We also study
the mean time to reach a consensus when zealots support only one party.

sparsity-inducing approach is proposed for this purpose. First, a simple
interpolation is applied to incomplete noisy data. Then, we propose a
spatio-temporal dictionary learning method to obtain an appropriate sparse
representation of data based on a joint sparse recovery algorithm. Then, using
the sparse coefficients and the learned dictionary, the 3D data is effectively
denoised by minimizing a simple cost function. We consider two types of
terahertz data to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach; THz data
acquired for a model sample with clear layered structures (e.g., a T-shape
plastic sheet buried in a polythene pellet), and pharmaceutical tablet data
(with low spatial resolution). The achieved signal-to-noise-ratio for
reconstruction of T-shape data, from only 5% observation was 19 dB. Moreover,
the accuracies of obtained thickness and depth measurements for pharmaceutical

separation of true variables is hindered because of wavelength-correlated
systematics of instrumental and atmospheric origin, or due to possible data
reduction anomalies. The main aim is to review the current inventory of
correlation variability indices and measure the efficiency for selecting
non-stochastic variations in photometric data. The WFCAM Science Archive (WSA)
were used to test the different indices. We improve the panchromatic
variability indices and introduce a new set of variability indices for
preselecting variable star candidates. Using the WFCAMCAL Variable Star

we test new insights about these indices to improve the efficiency of detection
of time-series data dominated by correlated variations. We propose five new
variability indices which display a high efficiency for the detection of
variable stars. We determine the best way to select variable stars using these

expression to select likely variables using the fraction-of-fluctuations on
these indices (f_fluc). The f_fluc can be used as an universal way to analyse
photometric data since it displays a only weak dependency with the instrument

scales, from one day to centuries and beyond, using a variety of assumptions.
Also considered is the latitude variation of the T-TSI correlations, where it
appears that over most of the globe there is a small increase in the
sensitivity of temperature to TSI in time. It is found that the mean global
sensitivity (alpha)measured in K(Wm-2)-1 varies from about 0.003 for 1 day, via
0.05 for 11-years to about 0.2 for decades to centuries. We conclude that mean
global temperature changes related to TSI are not significant from 1975
onwards.
  Before 1975, when anthropogenic gases were less important, many of the
temperature changes can be attributed to TSI variations. Over much longer
periods of time, from Kyear to Myear, the TSI changes are more efficient still,
the sensitivity alpha increasing ro about 0.5. Since 1975 the changes in mean
global temperature are not due to TSI changes, but rather to the increasing

for non-monotonic spatial reasoning ---a crucial requirement within dynamic

ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and a
method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Sat Modulo Theories (SMT)
instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We
formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame
axioms using choice formulas. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding
spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT
with the theory of real nonlinear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS)
in comparison with other prominent contemporary spatial reasoning systems. Our
results show that ASPMT(QS) is the only existing system that is capable of
reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i.e. addressing the ramification
problem), and integrating geometric and qualitative spatial information within
a non-monotonic spatial reasoning context.

research, is limited to low turbulent intensities due the current and future
computer resources. Standard turbulence models, like RaNS (Reynolds averaged

engineering, but they miss small scale effects, which are frequently of
importance, see e.g. the whole area of reactive flows, flows with apparent
Prandtl or Schmidt number effects, or even wall bounded flows. A recent
alternative to these standard approaches is the one-dimensional turbulence
(ODT) model, which is limited to 1D sub-domains. In two papers we will provide
a generalized filter strategy, called XLES (extended LES), including a formal
theory (part I) and one special approach in the XLES family of models, called
ODTLES (in part II (see Glawe et al. (2015))). ODTLES uses an ODT sub-grid
model to describe all turbulent scales not represented by XLES, which leaves
the larger scales to be simulated in 3D. This allows a turbulence modeling
approach with a 3D resolution mainly independent of the turbulent intensity.
Thus ODTLES is able to compute highly turbulent flows in domains of moderate
complexity affordably and including the full range of turbulent and diffusive
scales. The convergence of XLES to DNS is shown and the unconventional XLES
advection approach is investigated in basic numerical tests. In part II, highly
turbulent channel and duct flow results are discussed and show the future

denoted here by {\sl irreducibility} and {\sl insaturation}, representing
delimiters for self-referentiality. These features are then related to physical
laws by realizing that nature is a self-referential system obeying bounds
similar to those respected by mathematics. Self-referential systems can only be
autonomous entities by a kind of metabolism that provides and sustains such an
autonomy. A rational mind, able of consciousness, is a manifestation of the
self-referentiality of the Universe. Hence mathematics is here proposed to go
beyond language by actually representing the most fundamental existence
condition for self-referentiality. This idea is synthesized in the form of a
principle, namely, that {\sl mathematics is the ultimate tactics of
self-referential systems to mimic themselves}. That is, well beyond an
effective language to express the physical world, mathematics uncovers a deep
manifestation of the autonomous nature of the Universe, wherein the human brain

modes remains one of the major pending goal in the field of topological
materials. One common strategy to generate TS is through the coupling of an
s-wave superconductor to a helical half-metallic system. Numerous proposals for
the latter have been put forward in the literature, most of them based on
semiconductors or topological insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here
we demonstrate an alternative approach for the creation of TS in
graphene/superconductor junctions without the need of spin-orbit coupling. Our
prediction stems from the helicity of graphene's zero Landau level edge states
in the presence of interactions, and on the possibility, experimentally
demonstrated, to tune their magnetic properties with in-plane magnetic fields.
We show how canted antiferromagnetic ordering in the graphene bulk close to
neutrality induces TS along the junction, and gives rise to isolated,
topologically protected Majorana bound states at either end. We also discuss
possible strategies to detect their presence in graphene Josephson junctions
through Fraunhofer pattern anomalies and Andreev spectroscopy. The latter in
particular exhibits strong unambiguous signatures of the presence of the
Majorana states in the form of universal zero bias anomalies. Remarkable
progress has recently been reported in the fabrication of the proposed type of
junctions, which offers a promising outlook for Majorana physics in graphene
systems.

deposits produced by ballistic-type growth models are studied. The particles
start at the external surface of the deposits and enter their pores, in order
to simulate an external flux of a species towards a porous solid. For short
times, the walker concentration decays as a stretched exponential of the depth
z, but a crossover to long time normal diffusion is observed in most samples.
The anomalous concentration profile remains at long times in very porous solids
if the walker steps are restricted to nearest neighbors and is accompanied with
subdiffusion features. These findings are correlated with a decay of the
explored area with z. The study of RW of tracer particles left at the internal
part of the solid rules out an interpretation by diffusion equations with
position-dependent coefficients. A model of RW in a tube of decreasing cross
section explains those results by showing long crossovers from an effective
subdiffusion regime to an asymptotic normal diffusion. The crossover position
and density are analytically calculated for a tube with area decreasing
exponentially with z and show good agreement with numerical data. The anomalous
decay of the concentration profile is interpreted as a templating effect of the
tube shape on the total number of diffusing particles at each depth, while the
volumetric concentration in the actually explored porous region may not have
significant decay. These results may explain the anomalous diffusion of metal
atoms in porous deposits observed in recent works. They also confirm the
difficulty in interpreting experimental or computational data on anomalous
transport reported in recent works, particularly if only the concentration
profiles are measured.

generalized propensity score covariates to correct for potential

estimates of mean average potential outcomes for distinct strata of the
treatment. A polynomial regression is then fitted to these point estimates to
derive a Taylor approximation to the continuous dose-response function. The
bootstrap is used for variance estimation. Analytical results and simulations

good relative to minimum variance consistent estimators.

bolometric radiated flare energy for different observed components of stellar
flares, and show that there is rough agreement for these values with solar
flares. We apply an equipartition between the bolometric radiated flare energy
and kinetic energy in an accompanying mass ejection, seen in solar eruptive
events and expected from reconnection. This allows an integrated flare rate in
a particular waveband to be used to estimate the amount of associated transient
mass loss. This approach is supported by a good correspondence between
observational flare signatures on high flaring rate stars and the Sun, which
suggests a common physical origin. If the frequent and extreme flares that
young solar-like stars and low-mass stars experience are accompanied by
transient mass loss in the form of coronal mass ejections, then the cumulative
effect of this mass loss could be large. We find that for young solar-like

eruptions could have significant impacts on disk evolution, and thus planet
formation, and also exoplanet habitability.

data in order to be trained to high accuracy. Recently, high-dimensional
parametric models like neural networks have succeeded in building rich
representations using either compressive, reconstructive or supervised
criteria. However, the semantic structure inherent in observations is
oftentimes lost in the process. Human perception excels at understanding
semantics but cannot always be expressed in terms of labels. Thus,
\emph{oracles} or \emph{human-in-the-loop systems}, for example crowdsourcing,
are often employed to generate similarity constraints using an implicit
similarity function encoded in human perception. In this work we propose to
combine \emph{generative unsupervised feature learning} with a
\emph{probabilistic treatment of oracle information like triplets} in order to
transfer implicit privileged oracle knowledge into explicit nonlinear Bayesian
latent factor models of the observations. We use a fast variational algorithm
to learn the joint model and demonstrate applicability to a well-known image
dataset. We show how implicit triplet information can provide rich information
to learn representations that outperform previous metric learning approaches as
well as generative models without this side-information in a variety of
predictive tasks. In addition, we illustrate that the proposed approach
compartmentalizes the latent spaces semantically which allows interpretation of
the latent variables.

reservoir model that incorporates all the characteristics of the reservoir that
are pertinent to its ability to store hydrocarbons and also to produce them.It
is a difficult problem due to non-linear and heterogeneous subsurface
properties and associated with a number of complex tasks such as data fusion,
data mining, formulation of the knowledge base, and handling of the
uncertainty.This present work describes the development of algorithms to obtain
the functional relationships between predictor seismic attributes and target
lithological properties. Seismic attributes are available over a study area
with lower vertical resolution. Conversely, well logs and lithological
properties are available only at specific well locations in a study area with
high vertical resolution.Sand fraction, which represents per unit sand volume
within the rock, has a balanced distribution between zero to unity.The thesis
addresses the issues of handling the information content mismatch between
predictor and target variables and proposes regularization of target property
prior to building a prediction model.In this thesis, two Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) based frameworks are proposed to model sand fraction from
multiple seismic attributes without and with well tops information
respectively. The performances of the frameworks are quantified in terms of
Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Square Error, Absolute Error Mean, etc.

processes have been proposed to play opposing roles in the emergence of
unpredictable collective behaviors like crowd panics, traffic jams, and market
bubbles. While adaptive processes are ubiquitous in mechanistic theories of
emergent social complexity, complementary theories understand incentives,
education, and other inducements to rationality as able to suppress such
outcomes.
  We show in a series of laboratory experiments that, rather than suppressing
complex social dynamics, sophisticated reasoning processes can support them.
Our experiments elicit flocking behavior in groups and show that it is driven
by the human ability to recursively anticipate the reasoning of others. We
identify this sophisticated flocking in three different games---the Beauty
Pageant, Mod Game, and Runway Game---across which game theory predicts no
formal similarity. The persistence of sophisticated flocking across unrelated
game types not only speaks to the phenomenon's robustness, it also suggests
that people are treating three supposedly different decision settings as
conceptually similar, implicating a second sophisticated cognitive ability:
human concept formation. We also find in participants' underlying reasoning
that the number of recursions they perform is limited not by any individual's
cognitive abilities, but by a social norm that emerges during flocking.
  By implicating both recursive reasoning and concept formation in complex
dynamics, we support interdisciplinary perspectives that emergent complexity is
typical of even the most intelligent populations and carefully designed social
systems.

Declassified records are hard to acquire and difficult to explore with the

of civilians targeted during the Vietnam War. The data are detailed, with up to
45 attributes recorded for 73,712 individual civilian suspects. I employ an
unsupervised machine learning approach of cleaning, variable selection,
dimensionality reduction, and clustering. I find support for a simplifying
typology of civilian targeting that distinguishes different kinds of suspects
and different kinds targeting methods. The typology is robust, successfully
clustering both government actors and rebel departments into groups that mirror
their known functions. The exercise highlights methods for dealing with high
dimensional found conflict data. It also illustrates how aggregating measures
of political violence masks a complex underlying empirical data generating
process as well as a complex institutional reporting process.

quantum `has' a property X with quantitative value x if and only if the
property X has just been measured with outcome x. It is then impossible to
recontextualize GR's principle of curvature in any quantum framework that
implies this BIRP, for a quantum cannot curve space-time if it doesn't have a
definite energy - which is supposed to be the cause of curvature - in absence
of observation to begin with. Concluding, it is ruled out that a quantum theory
of gravity, in which GR's principle of curvature is built in as a fundamental
physical principle, can be developed in any framework implying this BIRP.

Riemann is entirely given in terms of Ricci. Could this property be
universalized for all odd dimensions in a generalized theory? The answer is
yes, and this property uniquely singles out pure Lovelock (it has only one
$N$th order term in action) gravity for which $N$th order Lovelock Riemann
tensor is indeed given in terms of corresponding Ricci for all odd $d=2N+1$
