that f is ""<<""-increasing, where the preorder {Gamma1} << {Gamma2} means that

alternating metamaterial-birefringent random layered stacks, under uncorrelated

reported to suppress the Brewster delocalization for $\it{p}$-polarized light,
when ""standard"" isotropic layers (with positive index of refraction) are
considered instead of metamaterial layers, providing a generic means to produce
polarization-insensitive, broadband reflections. However, this enhancement of
localization is valid for short wavelengths $\lambda$ compared to the mean
layer thickness $a_0$. At higher wavelengths, we recover the Brewster anomalies
for $\it{p}$-polarized states impeding a remarkable localization of light. To
achieve a better localization for a wider range of wavelengths, we replaced the
conventional isotropic layers by negative-index metamaterials presenting low
losses and constant index of refraction over the near-infrared range. As a
result, our numerical calculations exhibit a linear dependence of the
localization length with $\lambda$ (in the region $5 <\lambda/a_0 < 60$)
reducing the Brewster anomalies in more than two orders of magnitude with
respect to the standard isotropic scheme at oblique incidence. This enhancement
of localization is practically independent of the thickness disorder kind and
is also held under weak refractive-index disorder.

developed involving stimulated radiative molecular association (SRMA) reactions
among the photons and atoms in the protosatellite disks of the planets. In this
model thermal energy is extracted from each disk due to a resonance at radii
where there is a match between the temperature in the disk and a photon energy.
Matter accumulates at these radii, and satellites and rings are ultimately
formed. Orbital radii of satellites of Uranus, Jupiter, and Neptune are related
to photon energies ($E_{PM}$ values) in the spectrum of molecular hydrogen.
Orbital radii of satellites of Saturn are related to photon energies ($E_{PA}$
values) in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen. The first hint that such
relationships exist is found in the linearity of the graphs of orbital radii of
uranian satellites vs. orbital radii of jovian satellites, as well as in the
graphs of orbital radii of uranian satellites vs. orbital radii of neptunian
satellites. An expression is determined which gives the temperature in
protosatellite disks where the evolution of each satellite begins. This
expression is used to find temperature distributions in the disks, which are
found to be similar to distributions calculated by other investigators.

has been confirmed with an accuracy that increases as times goes by. Here we
study the gravitational deflection of photons within the framework of classical
and semiclassical higher-derivative gravity (HDG) -- the only version of GR
that is known up to now to be renormalizable along with its matter couplings.
Since our computations are restricted to scales much below the Planck cut-off
we need not be afraid of the massive spin-2 ghost that haunts HDG. An upper
bound on the constant related to the $R^2_{\mu \nu}$-sector of the theory is
then found by analyzing -- from a classical and semiclassical viewpoint -- the
deflection angle of a photon passing by the Sun. This upper limit greatly
improves that available in the literature.

the robustness of skyrmions in these materials against thermal fluctuations and
finite-size effects. We find that in confined geometries and at finite
temperatures skyrmions are present in a large part of the phase diagram.
Moreover, we find that the confined geometry favors the skyrmion over the
spiral phase when compared to infinitely large systems. Upon tuning the
magnetic field through the skyrmion phase, the system undergoes a cascade of
transitions in the magnetic structure through states of different number of
skyrmions, elongated and half-skyrmions, and spiral states. We consider how
quantum and thermal fluctuations lift the degeneracies that occur at these
transitions, and find that states with more skyrmions are typically favored by
fluctuations over states with less skyrmions. Finally, we comment on electrical
detection of the various phases through the topological and anomalous Hall
effects.

complexity of simple functions, we introduce the class of

f(\mathbf{x}^{\pi}, \mathbf{y}^{\pi})$. Most of the commonly studied functions
in communication complexity are permutation-invariant. For such functions, we
present a simple complexity measure (computable in time polynomial in $n$ given
an implicit description of $f$) that describes their communication complexity
up to polynomial factors and up to an additive error that is logarithmic in the
input size. This gives a coarse taxonomy of the communication complexity of
simple functions. Our work highlights the role of the well-known lower bounds
of functions such as 'Set-Disjointness' and 'Indexing', while complementing
them with the relatively lesser-known upper bounds for 'Gap-Inner-Product'

work of Canonne et al. [ITCS 2015]). We also present consequences to the study
of communication complexity with imperfectly shared randomness where we show

$L_1$ alternate with layers of index of refraction $n_2$ and thickness $L_2$.
Positional disorder has been considered by shifting randomly the positions of
the layer boundaries with respect to periodic values. For homogeneous stacks,
we have shown that the localization length is modulated by the corresponding
bands and that $\xi$ is enhanced at the center of each allowed band. In the
limit of long-wavelengths $\lambda$, the parabolic behavior previously found in
purely disordered systems is recovered, whereas for $\lambda \ll L_1 + L_2$ a
saturation is reached. In the case of nearly periodic mixed stacks with the
condition $|n_1 L_1|=|n_2 L_2|$, instead of bands there is a periodic
arrangement of Lorenztian resonances, which again reflects itself in the
behavior of the localization length. For wavelengths of several orders of
magnitude greater than $L_1 + L_2$, the localization length $\xi$ depends
linearly on $\lambda$ with a slope inversely proportional to the modulus of the
reflection amplitude between alternating layers. When the condition $|n_1
L_1|=|n_2 L_2|$ is no longer satisfied, the transmission spectrum is very
irregular and this considerably affects the localization length.

air that accumulatively disturb a wave's phase and amplitude distribution as it
propagates. This impairs the effective range of laser weapons as well as the
performance of free space optical (FSO) communication systems. Adaptive optics
(AO) can be applied to effectively correct wavefront distortions in weak
turbulence situations. However, in strong or deep turbulence, where
scintillation and beam breakup are common phenomena, traditional wavefront
sensing techniques such as the use of Shack-Hartmann sensors lead to incorrect
results. Consequently, the performance of AO systems will be greatly
compromised. We propose a new approach that can determine the major phase
distortions in a beam instantaneously and guide an AO device to compensate for
the phase distortion in a few iterations. In our approach, we use a plenoptic
wavefront sensor to image the distorted beam into its 4D phase space. A fast
reconstruction algorithm based on graph theory is applied to recognize the
phase distortion of a laser beam and command the AO device to perform phase
compensation. As a result, we show in our experiments that an arbitrary phase
distortion with peak to peak value up to 22{\pi} can be corrected within a few
iteration steps. Scintillation and branch point problems are smartly avoided by
the plenoptic sensor and its fast reconstruction algorithm. In this article, we
will demonstrate the function of the plenoptic sensor, the fast reconstruction
algorithm as well as the beam correction improvements when our approach is

nano-electro-mechanical field effect transistors, focusing on the steepness of
its switching curve. We find that the subthreshold swing of the voltage
transfer characteristic is governed by two separate considerations - the
ability of the charges to correlate together through dipolar interactions and
amplify the active torque, versus the active pull-in forces that drive an
abrupt phase transition and close the air gap between the tip of the cantilever
and the drain. For small sized relays, dipolar and short-range Van Der Waals
'sticking' forces dominate, while for longer cantilevers the capacitive energy
acquires a major role. The individual pull-in and pull-out phases demonstrate a
remarkably low subthreshold swing driven by the capacitive forces, sharpened
further by dipolar correlation. The sharp switching, however, comes at the
expense of strong hysteresis as the metastable and stable states interchange
along the forward and reverse phases of the voltage scan.

contribution of the velocity vortices and the fast shock reflection and
refraction in the solar corona to the formation of the EUV waves. Following the
loss of equilibrium in the coronal magnetic structure, the flux rope exhibits
rapid motions and invokes the fast-mode shock forward of the rope, which then
produces the type II radio burst. The expansion of the fast shock, which is
associated with outward motion, takes place in various directions, and the
downward expansion shows the reflection and the refraction as a result of the
non-uniform background plasma. The reflected component of the fast shock
propagates upward and the refracted component propagates downward. As the
refracted component reaches the boundary surface, a weak echo is excited. The
Moreton wave is invoked as the fast shock touches the bottom boundary, so the
Moreton wave lags the type II burst. A secondary echo occurs in the area where
reflection of the fast shock encounters the slow-mode shock, and the nearby
magnetic field lines are further distorted because of the interaction between
the secondary echo and the velocity vortices. Our results indicate that the EUV
wave may arise from various processes that are revealed in the new simulations.

constructions characterised by universal mapping properties, within the realm
of compactifications of discrete structures. Some classic examples fit within
this broad picture: the Bohr compactification of an abelian group via
Pontryagin duality, the zero-dimensional Bohr compactification of a
semilattice, and the Nachbin order-compactification of an ordered set.
  The notion of a natural extension functor is extended to suitable categories
of structures and such a functor is shown to yield a reflection into an
associated category of topological structures. Our principal results address
reconciliation of the natural extension with the Bohr compactification or its
zero-dimensional variant. In certain cases the natural extension functor and a
Bohr compactification functor are the same, in others the functors have
different codomains but may agree on all objects. Coincidence in the stronger
sense occurs in the zero-dimensional setting precisely when the domain is a
category of structures whose associated topological prevariety is standard. It
occurs, in the weaker sense only, for the class of ordered sets and, as we
show, also for infinitely many classes of ordered structures.
  Coincidence results aid understanding of Bohr-type compactifications, which
are defined abstractly. Ideas from natural duality theory lead to an explicit
description of the natural extension which is particularly amenable for any
prevariety of algebras with a finite, dualisable, generator. Examples of such
classes---often varieties---are plentiful and varied, and in many cases the
associated topological prevariety is standard.

depending on the pressure and shear rate. We construct a phase diagram that

framework for first order covariant Hamiltonian field theories on manifolds
with boundaries. This work is a geometric fulfillment of Fock's
characterization of field theories as it appears in recent work by Cattaneo,
Mnev and Reshetikhin [Ca14]. This framework leads to a true geometric
understanding of conventional choices for boundary conditions. For example, the
boundary condition that the pull-back of the 1-form on the cotangent space of
fields at the boundary vanish, i.e. \pi * \alpha = 0 , is shown to be a
consequence of our finding that the boundary fields of the theory lie in the
0-level set of the moment map of the gauge group of the theory.
  It is also shown that the natural way to interpret Euler-Lagrange equations
as an evolution system near the boundary is as a presymplectic system in an
extended phase space containing the natural configuration and momenta fields at
the boundary together with extra degrees of freedom corresponding to the
transversal components at the boundary of the momenta fields of the theory. The
consistency conditions at the boundary are analyzed and the reduced phase space
of the system is determined to be a symplectic manifold with a distinguished
isotropic submanifold corresponding to the boundary data of the solutions of
Euler-Lagrange equations. This setting makes it possible to define well-posed
boundary conditions, and provides the adequate setting for the canonical
quantization of the system.
  The notions of the theory will be tested against three significant examples:
scalar fields, Poisson\sigma-model and Yang-Mills theories.

attention, in which the derivatives of a Quantity of Interest (QoI) with
respect to the uncertain parameters are utilized to improve the surrogate
approximation. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) are often employed in UQ, and
when the QoI can be represented by a sparse PCE, $\ell_1$-minimization can
identify the PCE coefficients with a relatively small number of samples. In
this work, we investigate a gradient-enhanced $\ell_1$-minimization, where
derivative information is computed to accelerate the identification of the PCE
coefficients. For this approach, stability and convergence analysis are
lacking, and thus we address these here with a probabilistic result. In
particular, with an appropriate normalization, we show the inclusion of
derivative information will almost-surely lead to improved conditions, e.g.
related to the null-space and coherence of the measurement matrix, for a
successful solution recovery. Further, we demonstrate our analysis empirically
via three numerical examples: a manufactured PCE, an elliptic partial
differential equation with random inputs, and a plane Poiseuille flow with
random boundaries. These examples all suggest that including derivative
information admits solution recovery at reduced computational cost.

that the error threshold in the fully random model appears as a crossover
region instead of a phase transition point, and as the fluctuation strength
increases the crossover region becomes smoother and smoother. Furthermore, it

represent world countries and their trade relations respectively, affects key
economic processes worldwide, including globalization, economic integration,
industrial production, and the propagation of shocks and instabilities.
Characterizing the ITN via a simple yet accurate model is an open problem. The
traditional Gravity Model (GM) successfully reproduces the volume of trade
between connected countries, using macroeconomic properties such as GDP,
geographic distance, and possibly other factors. However, it predicts a network
with complete or homogeneous topology, thus failing to reproduce the highly
heterogeneous structure of the ITN. On the other hand, recent maximum-entropy
network models successfully reproduce the complex topology of the ITN, but
provide no information about trade volumes. Here we integrate these two
currently incompatible approaches via the introduction of an Enhanced Gravity
Model (EGM) of trade. The EGM is the simplest model combining the GM with the
network approach within a maximum-entropy framework. Via a unified and
principled mechanism that is transparent enough to be generalized to any
economic network, the EGM provides a new econometric framework wherein trade
probabilities and trade volumes can be separately controlled by any combination
of dyadic and country-specific macroeconomic variables. The model successfully
reproduces both the global topology and the local link weights of the ITN,
parsimoniously reconciling the conflicting approaches. It also indicates that
the probability that any two countries trade a certain volume should follow a
geometric or exponential distribution with an additional point mass at zero
volume.

biology, 246 (2007) 28) showed that error threshold is no longer a phase
transition point but a crossover region whose width depends on the strength of
the random fluctuation in an environment. The underlying cause of this
phenomenon has not yet been well examined. In this article, we adopt a single
peak Gaussian distributed fitness landscape instead of a constant one to
investigate and analyze the change of the error threshold and the statistical
property of the quasi-species population. We find a roughly linear relation
between the width of the error threshold and the fitness fluctuation strength.
For a given quasi-species, the fluctuation of the relative concentration has a
minimum with a normal distribution of the relative concentration at the maximum
of the averaged relative concentration, it has however a largest value with a
bimodal distribution of the relative concentration near the error threshold.
The above results deepen our understanding of the quasispecies and error
threshold and are heuristic for exploring practicable antiviral strategies.

harmonic confinement and extend it to take care of effects of solvent quality
following a mean field approach where an exponent $\nu$ is introduced. The
model termed as ""Solvent Dependent Compacted Rouse with Internal Friction
(SDCRIF)"" is then used to calculate the reconfiguration time of a chain that
relates to recent F\""{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies on
folded and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and can account for the
effects of solvent quality as well as the denaturant concentration on the
reconfiguration dynamics. Following an ansatz that relates the strength of the
harmonic confinement ($k_c$) with the internal friction of the chain
($\xi_{int}$), SDCRIF can convincingly reproduce the experimental data and
explain how the denaturant can change the time scale for the internal friction.
It can also predict near zero internal friction in case of IDPs. In addition,
our calculations show that the looping time as well as the reconfiguration time
scales with the chain length $N$ as $\sim N^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ depends
weakly on the internal friction but has rather stronger dependence on the
solvent quality. In absence of any internal friction, $\alpha=2\nu+1$ and it
goes down in presence of internal friction, but looping slows down in general.
On the contrary, poorer the solvent, faster the chain reconfigures and forms
loop, even though one expects high internal friction in the collapsed state.
However, if the internal friction is too high then the looping and
reconfiguration dynamics become slow even in poor solvent.

state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of

essentially determines the abundance of the QCD axion in the Universe, and is
commonly estimated, based on the instanton picture, to be a certain negative
power of temperature. While lattice QCD should be able to check this behavior
in principle, the temperature range where lattice QCD works is rather limited
in practice, because the topological charge is apt to freezes at high
temperatures. In this work, two exploratory studies are presented. In the first
part, we try to specify the temperature range in the quenched approximation.
Since our purpose here is to estimate the range expected in unquenched QCD
through quenched simulations, hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is employed
instead of heatbath algorithm. We obtain an indication that unquenched
calculations of chi_t encounter the serious problem of autocorrelation already
at T~2Tc or even below with the plain HMC. In the second part, we revisit the
axion abundance. The absolute value and the temperature dependence of chi_t in
real QCD can be significantly different from that in the quenched
approximation, and is not well established above the critical temperature.
Motivated by this fact and precedent arguments which disagree with the
conventional instanton picture, we estimate the axion abundance in an extreme
case where chi_t decreases much faster than the conventional power-like

proposed for the decomposition of NO. A general expression for the rate
constant of NO decomposition is obtained by assuming that the rate-determining
step consists of the transferring of a single atom associated with breaking of
the N-O bond. The analysis is performed on the base of the generalized Langevin
equation and takes into account both the potential interactions in the system
and the memory effects due to the zeolite vibrations. Two different mechanisms
corresponding to monomolecular and bimolecular NO decomposition are discussed.
The catalytic effect in the monomolecular mechanism is related to both the Cu+
ions and zeolite O-vacancies, while in the case of the bimolecular mechanism
the zeolite contributes through dissipation only. The comparison of the
theoretically calculated rate constants with experimental results reveals
additional information about the geometric and energetic characteristics of the
active centers and confirms the logic of the proposed models.

the notions of majorization and entropy. A natural question then arises: can we
reconstruct these notions from purely operational axioms? We address this
question in the framework of general probabilistic theories, presenting a set
of axioms that guarantee that every state can be diagonalized. The first axiom
is Causality, which ensures that the marginal of a bipartite state is well
defined. Then, Purity Preservation states that the set of pure transformations
is closed under composition. The third axiom is Purification, which allows to
assign a pure state to the composition of a system with its environment.
Finally, we introduce the axiom of Pure Sharpness, stating that for every
system there exists at least one pure effect occurring with unit probability on
some state. For theories satisfying our four axioms, we show a constructive
algorithm for diagonalizing every given state. The diagonalization result
allows us to formulate a majorization criterion that captures the
convertibility of states in the operational resource theory of purity, where
random reversible transformations are regarded as free operations.

direct astronomical means of estimating the local dark matter density,
$\rho_{DM}$. Current estimates based on the mid-plane dynamic density use a
local baryonic correction that ignores the non-local effects of spiral
structure and significantly underestimates the amount of dynamically relevant
gas; the additional gas plus the remaining uncertainties make it practically
impossible to measure $\rho_{DM}$ from mid-plane kinematics alone. The sampling
of inhomogeneous tracer populations with different scale-heights and
scale-lengths results in a systematic increase in the observed dispersion
gradients and changes in the nominal density distributions that, if not
properly considered, can be misinterpreted as a sign of more dark matter. If
the disc gravity is modelled using an infinite disc, the local variation in the
vertical gravity due to the globally exponential disc components results in an
underestimation of the baryonic contribution by as much as ~40% Given only the
assumptions of stationarity, an axially and vertically symmetric disc, doubly
exponential tracer and mass-component density profiles, a phenomenologically
justified model for the cross-dispersion component $\sigma_{Rz}$, and a
realistic model for $g_z$, it is possible to solve the full vertical Jeans
equation analytically for the vertical dispersion $\sigma_{z}(z)$ and hence
test the robustness of previous attempts at measuring $\rho_{DM}$. When the
model parameters are estimated from SEGUE G dwarf star data, it is still not
possible to explain the difference in behaviour seen in the simple thick- and
thin-disc datasets reported by Buedenbender et al.. Rather than being a
fundamental problem with the kinematical model, this effect appears to be a
further sign of the difficulty of defining and handling kinematically
homogeneous tracer populations.

decrease of the objective function. In this frame, we especially address the
possibility of adopting a metric which may change at each iteration and an
inexact computation of the proximal point defining the descent direction. For
the more general nonconvex case, we prove that all limit points of the iterates
sequence are stationary, while for convex objective functions we prove the
convergence of the whole sequence to a minimizer, under the assumption that a
minimizer exists. In the latter case, assuming also that the gradient of the

rate estimate, showing the O(1/k) complexity with respect to the function

mechanisms, which in turn shape the emerging structure of the social network.
Large-scale empirical observations of social interaction structure have become
possible only recently, and modelling their dynamics is an actual challenge.
Here we propose a temporal network model which builds on the framework of
activity-driven time-varying networks with memory. The model also integrates
key mechanisms that drive the formation of social ties - social reinforcement,
focal closure and cyclic closure, which have been shown to give rise to
community structure and the global connectedness of the network. We compare the
proposed model with a real-world time-varying network of mobile phone
communication and show that they share several characteristics from
heterogeneous degrees and weights to rich community structure. Further, the
strong and weak ties that emerge from the model follow similar weight-topology
correlations as real-world social networks, including the role of weak ties.

graph analytics is increasingly attracting companies from a variety of
industries, ranging from web companies to traditional enterprise businesses. To
analyze a graph, a user often executes isolated graph queries using a dedicated
interface---a procedural graph programming interface or a declarative graph
query language. The results are then returned and displayed using a specific
visualization technique. This follows the classical ad-hoc
Query$\rightarrow$Result interaction paradigm and often requires multiple query
iterations until an interesting aspect in the graph data is identified. This is
caused on the one hand by the schema flexibility of graph data and on the other
hand by the intricacies of declarative graph query languages. To lower the
burden for the user to explore an unknown graph without prior knowledge of a
graph query language, visual graph exploration provides an effective and
intuitive query interface to navigate through the graph interactively.
  We demonstrate GRAPHVISTA, a graph visualization and exploration tool that
can seamlessly combine ad-hoc querying and interactive graph exploration within
the same query session. In our demonstration, conference attendees will see
GRAPHVISTA running against a large real-world graph data set. They will start
by identifying entry points of interest with the help of ad-hoc queries and
will then discover the graph interactively through visual graph exploration.

reasoning, instead of ad hoc guesswork? A positive answer was provided in Refs.
[1, 2], where we put forward six principles that identify quantum theory
uniquely in a broad class of theories. We first defined a class of ""theories of
information"", constructed as extensions of probability theory in which events
can be connected into networks. In this framework, we formulated the six
principles as rules governing the control and the accessibility of information.
Directly from these rules, we reconstructed a number of quantum information
features, and eventually, the whole Hilbert space framework. In short, our
principles characterize quantum theory as the theory of information that allows
for maximal control of randomness.

properly contained inside the set of separable states. We give a
characterization of zero-oblique-discord states via quantum operation, provide

that low-energy supersymmetry is indeed realized in nature, despite the null
observation of superparticles below a TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. As we
argue in this paper, superparticles masses in the multi-TeV range can, in fact,
be reconciled with the concept of naturalness by means of a cosmological
selection effect--a selection effect based on the assumption of an exact
discrete R-symmetry that is spontaneously broken by gaugino condensation in a
pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In such theories, the dynamical scale of
the Yang-Mills gauge interactions is required to be higher than the
inflationary Hubble scale, in order to avoid the formation of domain walls.
This results in a lower limit on the superparticle masses and leads us to
conclude that, according to the idea of naturalness, the most probable range of
superparticle masses is potentially located at the multi-TeV, if the
inflationary Hubble rate is of O(10^{14}) GeV. Our argument can be partially
tested by future measurements of the tensor fraction in the Cosmic Microwave
Background fluctuations.

derived. In the case of small initial disturbances the model yields simple
analytical dependencies between the main parameters of the problem: critical
force, compression rate, and initial disturbance. It is shown that the time
required for buckling is inversely proportional to cubic root of compression
velocity and logarithmically depends on the initial disturbance. Analytical
expression for critical buckling force as a function of compression velocity is

involves the analysis of hurricane landfalls with reported damages along the

evolution of the intensity of the process of hurricane landfall occurrences,

indicate an increase in the number of hurricane landfall occurrences and a
decrease in the median maximum wind speed at the peak of the season.

in the absence of gravity is studied on the basis of assumed equations of
motion. The system is modeled as an assembly of rigid spheres subject to
elastic direct interactions and to periodic actuating forces which sum to zero.
Hydrodynamic interactions are taken into account in the virtual mass matrix and
in the friction matrix of the assembly. An equation of motion is derived for
the velocity of the geometric center of the assembly. The mean power is
calculated as the mean rate of dissipation. The full range of viscosity is
covered, so that the theory can be applied to the flying of birds, as well as
to the swimming of fish or bacteria. As an example a system of three equal
spheres moving along a common axis is studied.

computational cost required when the number of particles is huge, especially
for fine powders and/or industry scale simulations. This study investigates the
scaling of model parameters that is necessary to produce scale independent
predictions for cohesionless and cohesive solid under quasi-static simulation
of confined compression and unconfined compression to failure in uniaxial test.
A bilinear elasto-plastic adhesive frictional contact model was used. The
results show that contact stiffness (both normal and tangential) for loading
and unloading scales linearly with the particle size and the adhesive force
scales very well with the square of the particle size. This scaling law would
allow scaled up particle DEM model to exhibit bulk mechanical loading response
in uniaxial test that is similar to a material comprised of much smaller
particles. This is a first step towards a mesoscopic representation of a
cohesive powder that is phenomenological based to produce the key bulk
characteristics of a cohesive solid and has the potential to gain considerable
computational advantage for industry scale DEM simulations.

this cluster was observed at 88, 118, 154, 188 and 215 MHz. The known radio
relics, towards the eastern and western peripheries of the cluster, were
detected at all the frequencies. The relics, with a linear extent of $\sim$ 1
Mpc each, are separated by $\sim$ 2 Mpc. Combining the current observations
with those in the literature, we have obtained the spectra of these relics over
the frequency range 80 -- 1400 MHz. The spectra follow power laws, with
$\alpha$ = $-1.17\pm0.06$ and $-1.37\pm0.08$ for the west and east relics,
respectively ($S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$). Assuming the break frequency to be
near the lower end of the spectrum we estimate the age of the relics to be
$\sim$ 0.4 Gyr. No diffuse radio emission from the central regions of the
cluster (halo) was detected. The upper limit on the radio power of any possible
halo that might be present in the cluster is a factor of 35 lower than that
expected from the radio power and X-ray luminosity correlation for cluster
halos. From this we conclude that the cluster halo is very extended ($>$ 500
kpc) and/or most of the radio emission from the halo has decayed. The current
limit on the halo radio power is a factor of ten lower than the existing upper
limits with possible implications for models of halo formation.

of microbial diversity. Sequencing errors will also result in OTUs that are not
accurate reconstructions of the original biological sequences. Herein we
present a novel and sensitive sequence filtering algorithm that minimizes both
problems by calculating the exact error-probability distribution of a sequence
from its quality scores. In order to validate our method, we quality-filtered
thirty-seven publicly available datasets obtained by sequencing mock and
environmental microbial communities with the Roche 454, Illumina MiSeq and
IonTorrent PGM platforms, and compared our results to those obtained with
previous approaches such as the ones included in mothur, QIIME and UPARSE. Our
algorithm retained substantially more reads than its predecessors, while
resulting in fewer and more accurate OTUs. This improved sensitiveness produced
more faithful representations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the
true microbial diversity present in the studied samples. Furthermore, the
method introduced in this work is computationally inexpensive and can be
readily applied in conjunction with any existent analysis pipeline.

oscillator (GLO) model we achieve good agreement with experimental data. The
agreement is similarly reached for PESs based on two different semi-local
density-functional theory functionals. This robustness of the simulated
sticking curve does not extend to the underlying adsorption mechanism, which is
predominantly directly dissociative for one functional or molecularly trapped
for the other. Completely different adsorption mechanisms therewith lead to
rather similar sticking curves that agree equally well with the experimental
data. This highlights the danger of the prevalent practice to extract
corresponding mechanistic details from simple fingerprints of measured sticking
data for such exothermic surface reactions.

matrix $M_\nu$ displays flavour antisymmetry, $S_\nu^T M_\nu S_\nu=-M_\nu$ with
respect to some discrete symmetry $S_\nu$ contained in $SU(3)$ and ($ii$)
$S_\nu$ together with a symmetry $T_l$ of the Hermitian combination
$M_lM_l^\dagger$ of the charged lepton mass matrix forms a finite discrete
subgroup $G_f$ of $SU(3)$ whose breaking generates these symmetries. Assumption
($i$) leads to at least one massless neutrino and allows only four textures for
the neutrino mass matrix in a basis with a diagonal $S_\nu$ if it is assumed
that the other two neutrinos are massive. Two of these textures contain a
degenerate pair of neutrinos.Assumption ($ii$) can be used to determine the
neutrino mixing patterns. We work out these patterns for two major group series
$\Delta(3 N^2)$ and $\Delta(6 N^2)$ as $G_f$. It is found that all $\Delta(6
N^2)$ and $\Delta(3 N^2)$ groups with even $N$ contain some elements which can
provide appropriate $S_\nu$. Mixing patterns can be determined analytically for
these groups and it is found that only one of the four allowed neutrino mass
textures is consistent with the observed values of the mixing angles
$\theta_{13}$ and $\theta_{23}$. This texture corresponds to one massless and a
degenerate pair of neutrinos which can provide the solar pair in the presence
of some perturbations. The well-known groups $A_4$ and $S_4$ provide examples
of the groups in respective series allowing correct $\theta_{13}$ and
$\theta_{23}$. An explicit example based on $A_4$ and displaying a massless and
two quasi degenerate neutrinos is discussed.

polynomials may be required, which leads to a large polynomial basis whereas
usually only a few of the basis functions are in fact significant. Taking into

PCE (SPCE), have been recently proposed to alleviate the computational issue.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to SPCE, which allows one to exploit
the model's hierarchical structure. The proposed approach is based on the
adaptive enrichment of the polynomial basis using the so-called principle of
heredity. As a result, one can reduce the computational burden related to a
large pre-defined candidate set while obtaining higher accuracy with the same

take turns in deciding in each vertex which edge to traverse next. The decider
in each vertex also has to pay the cost of the chosen edge. We want to
determine the path where each player minimizes its costs taking into account
that also the other player acts in a selfish and rational way. Such a solution

  We show that the decision problem associated with such a path is
PSPACE-complete even for bipartite graphs both for the directed and the

numerically using a t-DMRG scheme, is found to satisfy analytically predicted
scaling relations in both the cases. However, analyzing the temporal evolution
of the Loschmidt overlap, we find different possibilities of the presence (or
absence) of dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) manifested in the
non-analyticities of the rate function. Even though the model is
non-integrable, there are {periodic} occurrences of DPTs when the system is
slowly ramped across the quantum critical point (QCP) as opposed to the
ferromagnetic (FM) version of the model; this numerical finding is
qualitatively explained by mapping the original model to an effective
integrable spin model which is appropriate for describing such slow quenches.
Furthermore, concerning the sudden quenches, our numerical results show that in
some cases, DPTs can be present even when the spin chain is quenched within the
same phase or even to the QCP while in some other situations they completely
disappear even after quenching across the QCP. These observations lead us to
the conclusion that it is the change in the nature of the ground state that
determines the presence of DPTs following a sudden quench.

many scientific fields, from sediment transport to biological interactions to

completely mathematically describe the motion of inertial particles; however,
the motion of large aspherical particles is significantly more complex, and
current computational models are inadequate for large or highly-resolved

freely suspended particles and ambient turbulence. A better understanding of
this coupling will inform not only engineering and physics, but the
interactions between small aquatic organisms and their environments. We explore
the roles of shape and buoyancy on the motion of passive particles in
turbulence, and allow these particles to serve as models for meso-scale aquatic
organisms. The results of this study will allow us to more accurately predict
the motion of aspherical particles, giving new insights into oceanic carbon
cycling, industrial processes, and other important topics. This analysis will
also shed light onto biological questions of navigation, reproduction, and
predator-prey interaction by quantifying the turbulence-driven behavior of
meso-scale aquatic organisms, allowing researchers to sift out passive vs.
active effects in a behaving organism. Lastly, processes that are directly

for robust facial representation based on image gradients. It is termed as
structural binary gradient patterns (SBGP). To discover underlying local
structures in the gradient domain, we compute image gradients from multiple
directions and simplify them into a set of binary strings. The SBGP is derived
from certain types of these binary strings that have meaningful local
structures and are capable of resembling fundamental textural information. They
detect micro orientational edges and possess strong orientation and locality
capabilities, thus enabling great discrimination. The SBGP also benefits from
the advantages of the gradient domain and exhibits profound robustness against
illumination variations. The binary strategy realized by pixel correlations in
a small neighborhood substantially simplifies the computational complexity and
achieves extremely efficient processing with only 0.0032s in Matlab for a
typical face image. Furthermore, the discrimination power of the SBGP can be
enhanced on a set of defined orientational image gradient magnitudes, further
enforcing locality and orientation. Results of extensive experiments on various
benchmark databases illustrate significant improvements of the SBGP based
representations over the existing state-of-the-art local descriptors in the
terms of discrimination, robustness and complexity. Codes for the SBGP methods

a Shannon Gaussian channel. The receiver, which acts as both a decoder and
estimator, observes the noisy measurement of the channel output and makes an
optimal estimate of the state of the dynamical system in the minimum mean
square sense. Noisy feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is present.
The transmitter observes the noise-corrupted feedback message from the receiver
together with a possibly noisy measurement of the state the dynamical system.
These measurements are then used to encode the message to be transmitted over a
noisy Gaussian channel, where a per symbol power constraint is imposed on the
transmitted message. Thus, we get a mixed problem of Shannon's source-channel
coding problem and a sort of Kalman filtering problem. In particular, we
consider two feedback instances, one being feedback of receiver measurements
and the second being the receiver's state estimates. We show that optimal
encoders and decoders are linear filters with a finite memory and we give
explicitly the state space realizations of the optimal filters. For the case
where the transmitter has access to noisy measurements of the state, we derive
a separation principle for the optimal communication scheme. Furthermore, we
investigate the presence of noiseless feedback or no feedback from the receiver
to the transmitter. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a
stationary solution are also given for the feedback cases considered.

manipulation activities, including fraudulently boosting the number of Facebook

have been proposed and some deployed by Facebook that use graph co-clustering
to distinguish between genuine likes and those generated by farm-controlled
profiles. However, as we show in this paper, these tools do not work well with
stealthy farms whose users spread likes over longer timespans and like popular
pages, aiming to mimic regular users. We present an empirical analysis of the
graph-based detection tools used by Facebook and highlight their shortcomings
against more sophisticated farms. Next, we focus on characterizing content
generated by social networks accounts on their timelines, as an indicator of
genuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a wide range of features
extracted from timeline posts, which we group into two main classes: lexical
and non-lexical. We postulate and verify that like farm accounts tend to often
re-share content, use fewer words and poorer vocabulary, and more often
generate duplicate comments and likes compared to normal users. We extract
relevant lexical and non-lexical features and and use them to build a
classifier to detect like farms accounts, achieving significantly higher
accuracy, namely, at least 99% precision and 93% recall.

based on the fact that both are resource theories. In those theories the main
objects are consistent boxes, which can be transformed by certain operations to
achieve certain tasks. The amount of resource is quantified by appropriate
measures of the resource. Following recent paper [J.I. de Vicente, J. Phys. A:
Math. Theor. {\bf 47}, 424017 (2014)], and recent development of abstract
approach to resource theories, such as entanglement theory, we propose axioms
and welcome properties for operations and measures of resources. As one of the
axioms of the measure we propose the asymptotic continuity: the measure should
not differ on boxes that are close to each other by more than the distance with
a factor depending logarithmically on the dimension of the boxes. We prove that
relative entropy of contextuality is asymptotically continuous. Considering
another concept from entanglement theory---the convex roof of a measure---we
prove that for some non-local and contextual polytopes, the relative entropy of
a resource is upper bounded up to a constant factor by the cost of the
resource. Finally, we prove that providing a measure $X$ of resource does not
increase under allowed class of operations, such as e.g. wirings, the maximal
distillable resource which can be obtained by these operations is bounded from
above by the value of $X$ up to a constant factor. We show explicitly which
axioms are used in the proofs of presented results, so that analogous results
may remain true in other resource theories with analogous axioms. We also make
use of the known distillation protocol of bipartite nonlocality to show how
contextual resources can be distilled.

variation due to the presence of the fluctuating Cooper pairs of the coupling
between magnetic impurities. To describe these results at a phenomenological
level, we propose a Gaussian Ginzburg-Landau model for the FD which includes an

experimental framework for the identification of the criteria that need to be
taken into account to generate a pleasing photo collage. Five different
thematic photo datasets are used to create collages using state-of-the-art
criteria. A first subjective experiment where several subjects evaluated the
collages, emphasizes that different criteria are involved in the subjective
definition of pleasantness. We then identify new global and local criteria and
design algorithms to quantify them. The relative importance of these criteria
are automatically learned by exploiting the user preferences, and new collages
are generated. To validate our framework, we performed several psycho-visual
experiments involving different users. The results shows that the proposed
framework allows to learn a novel computational model which effectively encodes
an inter-user definition of pleasantness. The learned definition of
pleasantness generalizes well to new photo datasets of different themes and
sizes not used in the learning. Moreover, compared with two state of the art

allows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint of desirability
and through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions. On this basis, we
obtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of
incomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst
act---no best act is needed---, and that a weakened Archimedean axiom suffices
too; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity
assumption (that probabilities should be positive---they need not), which
enables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is
always possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a
worst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a
trivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence
coincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise
probability---this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state
independence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of
complete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not
capture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities
and we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly,
we argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to
model, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in case of non-Archimedean
problems. This leads us to suggest that desirability, rather than preference,
should be the primitive notion at the basis of decision-theoretic
axiomatisations.

recasting the resulting Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) as a convex
quadratic program (QP) with nonnegative constraints, different optimization
algorithms are compared for its solution: (i) a Greedy method, based on
different solvers for the unconstrained linear system (Conjugate Gradient CG,
Gauss-Seidel, Cholesky factorization), (ii) a constrained CG algorithm, (iii)
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and ($iv$) the

The latter method is two orders of magnitude faster than the Greedy CG method

we propose another type of warm start based on a refined criterion for the
identification of the initial trial contact domain that can be used in
conjunction with all the previous optimization algorithms. This method, called
Cascade Multi-Resolution (CMR), takes advantage of physical considerations
regarding the scaling of the contact predictions by changing the surface
resolution. The method is very efficient and accurate when applied to real or
numerically generated rough surfaces, provided that their power spectral
density function is of power-law type, as in case of self-similar fractal
surfaces.

entanglement in an extended quantum many-body system. Hence they may serve as a
theoretical (as well as an experimental) tool to detect the spatial properties
of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem. In the ground state of quantum
many-body systems, its scaling is typically linear in the boundary of the
subsystem (area law). Here we propose a microscopic insight into the spatial
structure of entanglement and fluctuations using the concept of \emph{contour},
recently introduced to decompose the bipartite entanglement entropy of lattice
free fermions between two extended regions $A$ and $B$ into contributions from
single sites in $A$. We generalize the notion of contour to the entanglement of
any quadratic (bosonic or fermionic) lattice Hamiltonian, as well as to
particle-number fluctuations. The entanglement and fluctuations contours are
found to generally decay when moving away from the boundary between $A$ and
$B$. We show that in the case of free fermions the decay of the entanglement
contour follows closely that of the fluctuation contour. In the case of
Bose-condensed interacting bosons, treated via the Bogoliubov and spin-wave
approximations, such a link cannot be established -- fluctuation and
entanglement contours are found to be radically different, as they lead to a
logarithmically violated area law for fluctuations, and to a strict area law of
entanglement. Analyzing in depth the role of the zero-energy Goldstone mode of
spin-wave theory, and of the corresponding lowest-energy mode in the
entanglement spectrum, we unveil a subtle interplay between the special contour
and energy scaling of the latter, and universal additive logarithmic
corrections to entanglement area law discussed extensively in the recent
literature.

$J/\psi$ decays is presented. In particular, a piecewise function that
describes the dynamics of the $\pi^{0}\pi^{0}$ system is determined as a
function of $M_{\pi^{0}\pi^{0}}$ from an analysis of the
$(1.311\pm0.011)\times10^{9}$ $J/\psi$ decays collected by the BESIII detector.
The goal of this analysis is to provide a description of the scalar and tensor
components of the $\pi^0\pi^0$ system while making minimal assumptions about
the properties or number of poles in the amplitude. Such a model-independent
description allows one to integrate these results with other related results
from complementary reactions in the development of phenomenological models,
which can then be used to directly fit experimental data to obtain parameters
of interest. The branching fraction of $J/\psi \to \gamma \pi^{0}\pi^{0}$ is
determined to be $(1.15\pm0.05)\times10^{-3}$, where the uncertainty is
systematic only and the statistical uncertainty is negligible.

the trivial insulator phase in the presence of electron-electron interaction is
an urgent question to the study of topological insulators, due to the fact that
most of the topological indices defined for free electron systems are very
likely unsuitable for interacting cases. In this work, we demonstrate that the
strange correlator is a sensitive diagnosis to detect SPT states in interacting
systems. Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we
investigate the interaction-driven quantum phase transition in the
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. The transition from the quantum spin Hall insulator at
weak interaction to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator at strong interaction
can be readily detected by the momentum space behavior of the strange
correlator in single-particle, spin, and pairing sectors. The interaction
effects on the symmetry-protected edge states in various sectors, i.e., the
helical Luttinger liquid behavior, are well captured in the QMC measurements of
strange correlators. Moreover, we demonstrate that the strange correlator is
technically easier to implement in QMC and more robust in performance than
other proposed numerical diagnoses for interacting topological states, as only
static correlations are needed. The attempt in this work paves the way for
using the strange correlator to study interaction-driven topological phase
transitions in fermionic as well as bosonic systems.

  arXiv:1505.05281",,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2D electronic spectroscopy studies, long-lived quantum beats have recently
been observed in photosynthetic systems, and it has been suggested that the
beats are produced by quantum mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational
states. Concerning the electronic-vibrational quantum mixtures, the impact of
protein-induced fluctuations was examined by calculating the 2D electronic
spectra of a weakly coupled dimer with vibrational modes in the resonant
condition [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 212403 (2015)]. This analysis demonstrated that
quantum mixtures of the vibronic resonance are rather robust under the
influence of the fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures, whereas the mixtures
are eradicated by the fluctuations at physiological temperatures. However, this
conclusion cannot be generalized because the magnitude of the coupling inducing
the quantum mixtures is proportional to the inter-pigment coupling. In this
study, we explore the impact of the fluctuations on electronic-vibrational
quantum mixtures in a strongly coupled dimer. with an off-resonant vibrational
mode. Toward this end, we calculate electronic energy transfer (EET) dynamics
and 2D electronic spectra of a dimer that corresponds to the most strongly
coupled bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex in a
numerically accurate manner. The quantum mixtures are found to be robust under
the exposure of protein-induced fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures,
irrespective of the resonance. At 300 K, however, the quantum mixing is
disturbed more strongly by the fluctuations, and therefore, the beats in the 2D
spectra become obscure even in a strongly coupled dimer with a resonant
vibrational mode. Further, the overall behaviors of the EET dynamics are
demonstrated to be dominated by the environment and coupling between the 0-0
vibronic transitions as long as the Huang-Rhys factor of the vibrational mode
is small.

for device-to-device (D2D) communications with the aid of the existing cellular
infrastructure. The goal is to build a location-specific TVWS database, which
provides a look-up table service for any D2D link to determine its maximum
permitted emission power (MPEP) in an unlicensed digital TV (DTV) band. To
achieve this goal, the idea of mobile crowd sensing is firstly introduced to
collect active spectrum measurements from massive personal mobile devices.
Considering the incompleteness of crowd measurements, we formulate the problem
of unknown measurements recovery as a matrix completion problem and apply a
powerful fixed point continuation algorithm to reconstruct the unknown elements
from the known elements. By joint exploitation of the big spectrum data in its
vicinity, each cellular base station further implements a nonlinear support
vector machine algorithm to perform irregular coverage boundary detection of a
licensed DTV transmitter. With the knowledge of the detected coverage boundary,
an opportunistic spatial reuse algorithm is developed for each D2D link to
determine its MPEP. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can
successfully enable D2D communications in TVWS while satisfying the
interference constraint from the licensed DTV services. In addition, to our
best knowledge, this is the first try to explore and exploit TVWS inside the
DTV protection region resulted from the shadowing effect. Potential application
scenarios include communications between internet of vehicles in the
underground parking, D2D communications in hotspots such as subway, game
stadiums, and airports, etc.
