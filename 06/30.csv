find the maximum distance between each boundary pixel column wise and row wise

$\theta$-stability defined for quiver representations by King and for

negatively a question raised in [BT15]. Also, we construct Harder-Narasimhan

inspired by the Cantero-Moral-Vel\'azquez approach to orthogonal Laurent

for a given Borel measure in the unit torus $\mathbb T^D$. The Gauss-Borel
factorization of this moment matrix allows for the construction of multivariate
biorthogonal Laurent polynomials in the unit torus which can be expressed as
last quasi-determinants of bordered truncations of the moment matrix.
  Christoffel type perturbations of the measure given by the multiplication by
Laurent polynomials are studied. Sample matrices on poised sets of nodes, which
belong to the algebraic hypersurface of the perturbing Laurent polynomial, are
used for the finding of a Christoffel formula that expresses the perturbed
orthogonal Laurent polynomials in terms of a last quasi-determinant of a
bordered sample matrix constructed in terms of the original orthogonal Laurent
polynomials. Poised sets exist only for nice Laurent polynomials which are
analyzed from the perspective of Newton polytopes and tropical geometry.
  Discrete and continuous deformations of the measure lead to a Toda type
integrable hierarchy, being the corresponding flows described through Lax and
Zakharov-Shabat equations; bilinear equations and vertex operators are found.
Varying size matrix nonlinear partial difference and differential equations of

space and time- total flux, magnetic gradients, and neutral lines; evolution in
time- flux evolution; structures at multiple size scales- wavelet analysis.
This combines pattern recognition and classification techniques via a relevance
vector machine to determine whether a region will flare. We consider
classification performance using all 38 extracted features and several feature
subsets. Classification performance is quantified using both the true positive
rate and the true negative rate. Additionally, we compute the true skill score
which provides an equal weighting to true positive rate and true negative rate
and the Heidke skill score to allow comparison to other flare forecasting work.
  We obtain a true skill score of ~0.5 for any predictive time window in the
range 2-24hr, with a TPR of ~0.8 and a TNR of ~0.7. These values do not appear
to depend on the time window, although the Heidke skill score (<0.5) does.
Features relating to snapshots of the distribution of magnetic gradients show
the best predictive ability over all predictive time windows. Other
gradient-related features and the instantaneous power at various wavelet scales
also feature in the top five ranked features in predictive power. While the
photospheric magnetic field governs the coronal non-potentiality (and
likelihood of flaring), photospheric magnetic field alone is not sufficient to
determine this uniquely. Furthermore we are only measuring proxies of the
magnetic energy build up. We still lack observational details on why energy is
released at any particular point in time. We may have discovered the natural
limit of the accuracy of flare predictions from these large scale studies.

period (0.45 days). Previous work by \citet{vaneyken12} and \citet{barnes13}
predicts that the stellar rotation axis and the planetary orbital plane should
precess with a period of $300 - 600$ days. As a consequence, the observed
transits should change shape and depth, disappear, and reappear with the
precession. Our observations indicate the long-term presence of the transit
events ($>3$ years), and that the transits indeed do change depth, disappear
and reappear. The Spitzer observations and the NIRSPEC radial velocity
observations (with contemporaneous LCOGT optical light curve data) are
consistent with the predicted transit times and depths for the $M_\star = 0.34\
M_\odot$ precession model and demonstrate the disappearance of the transits. An
LCOGT optical light curve shows that the transits do reappear approximately 1
year later. The observed transits occur at the times predicted by a
straight-forward propagation of the transit ephemeris. The precession model
correctly predicts the depth and time of the Spitzer transit and the lack of a
transit at the time of the NIRSPEC radial velocity observations. However, the
precession model predicts the return of the transits approximately 1 month
later than observed by LCOGT. Overall, the data are suggestive that the
planetary interpretation of the observed transit events may indeed be correct,
but the precession model and data are currently insufficient to confirm firmly
the planetary status of PTFO~8-8695b.

systematics for ongoing and future weak lensing surveys. This paper presents
the first forecasts of the impact of IA on cosmic shear measurements for
current and future surveys (DES, Euclid, LSST, WFIRST) using simulated
likelihood analyses and realistic covariances that include higher-order moments
of the density field in the computation. We consider a range of possible IA
scenarios and test mitigation schemes, which parameterize IA by the fraction of
red galaxies, normalization, luminosity and redshift dependence of the IA
signal (for a subset we consider joint IA and photo-z uncertainties). Compared
to previous studies we find smaller biases in time-dependent dark energy models
if IA is ignored in the analysis; the amplitude and significance of these
biases vary as a function of survey properties (depth, statistical
uncertainties), luminosity function, and IA scenario: Due to its small
statistical errors and relatively shallow observing strategy Euclid is
significantly impacted by IA. LSST and WFIRST benefit from their increased
survey depth, while the larger statistical errors for DES decrease IA's
relative impact on cosmological parameters. The proposed IA mitigation scheme
removes parameter biases due to IA for DES, LSST, and WFIRST even if the shape
of the IA power spectrum is only poorly known; successful IA mitigation for
Euclid requires more prior information. We explore several alternative IA
mitigation strategies for Euclid; in the absence of alignment of blue galaxies
we recommend the exclusion of red (IA contaminated) galaxies in cosmic shear
analyses. We find that even a reduction of 20% in the number density of
galaxies only leads to a 4-10% loss in cosmological constraining power.

no recourse to elasticity or scattering theories, we derive a general Langevin
equation for a crystal defect, with full treatment of discreteness and
non-linearity in the defect core. We obtain an analytical expression for the
drag force that is evaluated in molecular statics and molecular dynamics,
extracting the force on a defect directly from the inter-atomic forces. Our
results show that a temperature independent drag force arises because
vibrations in a discrete crystal are never independent of the defect motion, an
implicit assumption in any phonon-based approach. This effect remains even when
the Peierls barrier is effectively zero, invalidating qualitative explanations
involving the radiation of phonons. We apply our methods to an interstitial

good agreement with trajectory-based estimations of the thermal drag force.

massive amount of geographically distributed antennas, the resulting
computational cost and channel measurement overhead could be unaffordable for a
large-scale distributed antenna system (DAS). A scalable signal processing
framework is therefore highly desirable, which, as recently demonstrated in
\cite{Dai_TWireless}, could be established based on the concept of virtual
cell.
  In a virtual-cell based DAS, each user chooses a few closest base-station
(BS) antennas to form its virtual cell, that is, its own serving BS antenna
set. In this paper, we focus on a downlink DAS with a large number of users and
BS antennas uniformly distributed in a certain area, and aim to study the
effect of the virtual cell size on the average user rate. Specifically, by
assuming that maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is adopted in each user's
virtual cell, the achievable ergodic rate of each user is derived as an
explicit function of the large-scale fading coefficients from all the users to
their virtual cells, and an upper-bound of the average user rate is
established, based on which a rule of thumb is developed for determining the
optimal virtual cell size to maximize the average user rate. The analysis is
further extended to consider multiple users grouped together and jointly served
by their virtual cells using zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). In contrast to
the no-grouping case where a small virtual cell size is preferred, it is shown
that by grouping users with overlapped virtual cells, the average user rate can
be significantly improved by increasing the virtual cell size, though at the
cost of a higher signal processing complexity.

  Astronomy",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A turbulent flow is maintained by an external supply of kinetic energy, which
is eventually dissipated into heat at steep velocity gradients. The scale at
which energy is supplied greatly differs from the scale at which energy is
dissipated, the more so as the turbulent intensity (the Reynolds number) is
larger. The resulting energy flux over the range of scales, intermediate
between energy injection and dissipation, acts as a source of time
irreversibility. As it is now possible to follow accurately fluid particles in
a turbulent flow field, both from laboratory experiments and from numerical
simulations, a natural question arises: how do we detect time irreversibility
from these Lagrangian data? Here we discuss recent results concerning this
problem. For Lagrangian statistics involving more than one fluid particle, the
distance between fluid particles introduces an intrinsic length scale into the
problem. The evolution of quantities dependent on the relative motion between
these fluid particles, including the kinetic energy in the relative motion, or
the configuration of an initially isotropic structure can be related to the
equal-time correlation functions of the velocity field, and is therefore
sensitive to the energy flux through scales, hence to the irreversibility of
the flow. In contrast, for single-particle Lagrangian statistics, the most
often studied velocity structure functions cannot distinguish the ""arrow of
time."" Recent observations from experimental and numerical simulation data,
however, show that the change of kinetic energy following the particle motion,
is sensitive to time-reversal. We end the survey with a brief discussion of the
implication of this line of work.

also investigate the formation of spatial clusters of cities via a
percolation-like analysis, where clustering of cities and a phase
transition-like behavior describing the size of the largest cluster as a
function of a homicide threshold are observed. This transition-like behavior
presents evolutive features characterized by an increasing in the homicide

that along the radius ($r$) of the Bloch ball representing either of the two
single-qubit subsystems, this value appeared constant (but jumping to unity at
the locus of the pure states, $r=1$). Further, they also observed (personal
communication) such separability probability $r$-invariance, when using, more
broadly, random induced measure ($K=3,4,5,\ldots$), with $K=4$ corresponding to
the (symmetric) Hilbert-Schmidt case. Among the findings here is that this
invariance is maintained even after splitting the separability probabilities
into those parts arising from the determinantal inequality $|\rho^{PT}|
>|\rho|$ and those from $|\rho| > |\rho^{PT}| >0$, where the partial transpose
is indicated. The nine-dimensional set of generic two-re[al]bit states endowed
with Hilbert-Schmidt measure is also examined, with similar $r$-invariance
conclusions. Contrastingly, two-qubit separability probabilities based on the
Bures (minimal monotone) measure {\it diminish} with $r$. Moreover, we study
the forms that the separability probabilities take as joint (bivariate)
functions of the radii ($r_A, r_B$) of the Bloch balls of {\it both}
single-qubit subsystems. Here, a form of Bloch radii {\it repulsion} for
separable two-qubit systems emerges in {\it all} our several analyses.

Freidlin-Wentzell action and known to be able to characterize rare events in
such systems. While there is an impressive body of work concerning their
analytical description, this review focuses on the question on how to compute
these minimizers numerically. In a short introduction we present the relevant
mathematical and physical background before we discuss the stochastic Burgers
equation in detail. We present algorithms to compute instantons numerically by
an efficient solution of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. A second
focus is the discussion of a recently developed numerical filtering technique
that allows to extract instantons from direct numerical simulations. In the
following we present modifications of the algorithms to make them efficient
when applied to two- or three-dimensional fluid dynamical problems. We
illustrate these ideas using the two-dimensional Burgers equation and the
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.

Raman effect manifests itself in amorphous SiN microresonator based single
soliton states by a spectrum that is hyperbolic secant in shape, but whose
center is spectrally red-shifted (i.e. offset) from the continuous wave pump
laser. The Raman induced spectral red-shift is found to be tunable via the pump
laser detuning and grows linearly with peak power. The shift is theoretically
described by the first order shock term of the material's Raman response, and

that the Raman induced frequency shift can lead to a cancellation or
overcompensation of the soliton recoil caused by the formation of a (coherent)

connecting two points can be unique or not. In this paper, we study the
situation on the geodesic in the universal asymptotic Teichm\""uller space
$AT(\Delta)$. We introduce the notion of substantial point and non-substantial
point in $AT(\Delta)$. The set of all non-substantial points is open and dense
in $AT(\Delta)$. It is shown that there are infinitely many geodesics joining a
non-substantial point to the basepoint. Although we have difficulty in dealing
with the substantial points, we give an example to show that there are
infinitely many geodesics connecting certain substantial point and the
basepoint. It is also shown that there are always infinitely many straight
lines containing two points in $AT(\Delta)$. Moreover, with the help of the
Finsler structure on the asymptotic Teichm\""uller space, a variation formula
for the asymptotic Teichm\""uller metric is obtained.

the cumulant-generating function can be interpreted such that unit-charge

that this factorization property holds for a general $SO(4)$ scattering matrix,

often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori.
Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite
sample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore,
when directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a $N
\times N$ Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of
$N$ instances. The computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct
application of kernel methods on large datasets, and makes kernel learning
especially difficult. In this paper we introduce Bayesian nonparmetric
kernel-learning (BaNK), a generic, data-driven framework for scalable learning
of kernels. BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral distribution of
random frequencies allowing it to both learn kernels and scale to large
datasets. We show that this framework can be used for large scale regression
and classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that BaNK outperforms several
other scalable approaches for kernel learning on a variety of real world
datasets.

time-dependent Hamiltonians. Assuming an approximate scale separation between
two spatial regions where different potentials dominate, we derive an explicit
expansion for scattering problems with mixed cylindrical and spherical
symmetry, by matching wavefunctions of a periodic linear drive in the exterior
region to solutions of an arbitrary interior potential expanded in spherical
waves. Using this method we study quasi-bound states of a square-well potential
in three dimensions subject to an axial driving force. In the nonperturbative
regime we show how eigenfunctions develop an asymptotic dressing of different
partial waves, accompanied by large periodic oscillations in the angular
momentum and a nonmonotonous dependence of the decay rate on the drive

lasts many Gyr after their last major merger in cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations. The mass of disc gas, M$_{\rm gas}$, depends upon a galaxy halo's
spin and virial mass, but not upon stellar feedback. Halos with low spin have
high star formation efficiency and lower disc gas mass. Similarly, lower
stellar feedback leads to more star formation so the gas mass ends up nearly
the same irregardless of stellar feedback strength. Even considering spin, the
M$_{\rm gas}$ relation with halo mass, M$_{200}$ only shows a factor of 3
scatter. The M$_{\rm gas}$--M$_{200}$ relation show a break at
M$_{200}$=$2\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ that corresponds to an observed break in
the M$_{\rm gas}$--M$_\star$ relation. The constant disc mass stems from a
shared halo gas density profile in all the simulated galaxies. In their outer
regions, the profiles are isothermal. Where the profile rises above $n=10^{-3}$
cm$^{-3}$, the gas readily cools and the profile steepens. Inside the disc,
rotation supports gas with a flatter density profile except where supernova
explosions disrupt the disc. Energy injection from stellar feedback also
provides pressure support to the halo gas to prevent runaway cooling flows. The
resulting constant gas mass makes simpler models for galaxy formation possible,
either using a ""bathtub"" model for star formation rates or when modeling
chemical evolution.

that secular evolution due to the Sun can strongly affect the evolution of
outer satellites and rings in the system, if such exist. Although precession
due to extended gravitational potential from the inner Pluto-Charon binary
quench such secular evolution up to $a_{crit}\sim0.0035$ AU ($\sim0.09$
$R_{Hill}$ the Hill radius; including all of the currently known satellites),
outer orbits can be significantly altered. In particular, we find that
\emph{co-planar} rings and satellites should not exist beyond $a_{crit}$;
rather, satellites and dust particles in these regions secularly evolve on
timescales ranging between $10^{4}-10^{6}$ yrs, and quasi-periodically change
their inclinations and eccentricities through secular evolution (Lidov-Kozai
oscillations). Such oscillations can lead to high inclinations and
eccentricities, constraining the range where such satellites (and dust
particles) can exist without crossing the orbits of the inner satellites, or
crossing the outer Hill stability range. Outer satellites, if such exist are
therefore likely to be \emph{irregular} satellites, with orbits limited to be
non-circular and/or highly inclined. These could be potentially detected and
probed by the New-Horizon mission, possibly providing direct evidence for the
secular evolution of the Pluto satellite system, and shedding new light on its

to the Fermi energy, the inhomogeneous FFLO superconductor ultimately becomes a
normal metal. There is mounting experimental evidence for this scenario in 2D
organic superconductors in large in-plane magnetic fields; this is complemented
by ongoing efforts to realize this scenario in coupled tubes of atomic Fermi
gases with spin imbalance. Yet, a theory for the phase transition from a metal
to an FFLO superconductor has not been developed so far and the universality
class has remained unknown. Here we propose and analyze a spin imbalance driven
quantum critical point between a 2D metal and an FFLO phase in anisotropic
electron systems. We derive the effective action for electrons and bosonic FFLO
pairs at this quantum phase transition. Using this action, we predict non-Fermi
liquid behavior and the absence of quasi-particles at a discrete set of hot
spots on the Fermi surfaces. This results in strange power-laws in
thermodynamics and response functions, which are testable with existing
experimental set-ups on 2D organic superconductors and may also serve as
signatures of the elusive FFLO phase itself. The proposed universality class is
distinct from previously known quantum critical metals and, because its
critical fluctuations appear already in the pairing channel, a promising
candidate for naked metallic quantum criticality over extended temperature
ranges.

measure the total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies much
more precisely, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density of the local

obtained CFHT optical and near-IR images over the entire AKARI NEP deep field.
These new CFHT images are used to derive accurate photometric redshifts,
allowing us to fully exploit the whole AKARI NEP deep field. AKARI's deep,
continuous filter coverage in the mid-IR wavelengths (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11,

luminosities without using a large extrapolation based on spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting, which was the largest uncertainty in previous
studies. Total infrared luminosity (TIR) is also obtained more reliably due to
the superior filter coverage. The resulting restframe 8$\mu$m, 12$\mu$m, and
TIR LFs at $0.15<z<2.2$ are consistent with previous works, but with reduced
uncertainties, especially at the high luminosity-end, thanks to the wide field

towards its outskirts, which was found to host numerous emission-line galaxies.
We performed extremely deep Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope HI
observations of the 'Sausage' cluster to investigate the effect of the merger
and the shocks on the gas reservoirs fuelling present and future star formation
(SF) in cluster members. By using spectral stacking, we find that the
emission-line galaxies in the 'Sausage' cluster have, on average, as much HI
gas as field galaxies (when accounting for the fact cluster galaxies are more
massive than the field galaxies), contrary to previous studies. Since the
cluster galaxies are more massive than the field spirals, they may have been
able to retain their gas during the cluster merger. The large HI reservoirs are
expected to be consumed within $\sim0.75-1.0$ Gyr by the vigorous SF and AGN
activity and/or driven out by the out-flows we observe. We find that the
star-formation rate in a large fraction of H$\alpha$ emission-line cluster
galaxies correlates well with the radio broad band emission, tracing supernova

post-shock regions, may have been undergoing sustained SFR for at least 100

Sobral et al. (2015) that gas-rich cluster galaxies have been triggered to form
stars by the passage of the shock.

non-equilibrium abundances. We compare these to simulations evolved using
cooling rates calculated assuming chemical (including ionisation) equilibrium,

higher star formation rates and stronger outflows at higher metallicity and for
weaker radiation fields, as gas can more easily cool to a cold (few hundred
Kelvin) star forming phase under such conditions. Contrary to variations in the
metallicity and the radiation field, non-equilibrium chemistry generally has no
strong effect on the total star formation rates or outflow properties. However,
it is important for modelling molecular outflows. For example, the mass of
H$_{2}$ outflowing with velocities $> 50 \, \rm{km} \, \rm{s}^{-1}$ is enhanced
by a factor $\sim 20$ in non-equilibrium. We also compute the observable line
emission from CII and CO. Both are stronger at higher metallicity, while CII

chemistry. However, emission from CO varies by a factor of $\sim 2 - 4$. This
has implications for the mean $X_{\rm{CO}}$ conversion factor between CO
emission and H$_{2}$ column density, which we find is lowered by up to a factor
$\sim 2.3$ in non-equilibrium, and for the fraction of CO-dark molecular gas.

the evolution of star clusters. Such encounters can also dramatically modify
the orbital parameters of binaries, exchange partners in and out of binaries,
and are a primary contributor to the rate of physical stellar collisions in
star clusters. Often, these encounters are studied under the approximation that
they happen quickly enough and within a small enough volume to be considered
isolated from the rest of the cluster. In this paper, we study the validity of
this assumption through the analysis of a large grid of single - binary and
binary - binary scattering experiments. For each encounter we evaluate the
encounter duration, and compare this with the expected time until another
single or binary star will join the encounter. We find that for lower-mass
clusters, similar to typical open clusters in our Galaxy, the percent of
encounters that will be ""interrupted"" by an interloping star or binary may be
20-40% (or higher) in the core, though for typical globular clusters we expect
<1% of encounters to be interrupted. Thus, the assumption that strong
encounters occur in relative isolation breaks down for certain clusters.
Instead, many strong encounters develop into more complex ""mini-clusters"",
which must be accounted for in studying, for example, the internal dynamics of
star clusters, and the physical stellar collision rate.

to identify the voids strongly influences the properties of the void

characterised by an excess of large voids in the cold dark matter distribution
as compared to the reference standard cosmology, due to their higher
normalisation of linear perturbations at low redshifts. Specifically, these
models present an excess of large voids with $R_{eff}>20, 15, 12$ Mpc h^{-1},

or group, is only a minor feature of the protocluster, containing less than 20
per cent of all protocluster galaxies at $z=2$. Furthermore, many protoclusters
do not contain a main halo that is massive enough to be identified as a high
redshift cluster. Protoclusters exist in a range of evolutionary states at high
redshift, independent of the mass they will evolve to at $z=0$. We show that
the evolutionary state of a protocluster can be approximated by the mass ratio
of the first and second most massive haloes within the protocluster, and the
$z=0$ mass of a protocluster can be estimated to within 0.2 dex accuracy if
both the mass of the main halo and the evolutionary state is known. We also
investigate the biases introduced by only observing star-forming protocluster
members within small fields. The star formation rate required for line-emitting
galaxies to be detected is typically high, which leads to the artificial loss
of low mass galaxies from the protocluster sample. This effect is stronger for
observations of the centre of the protocluster, where the quenched galaxy
fraction is higher. This loss of low mass galaxies, relative to the field,
distorts the size of the galaxy overdensity, which in turn can contribute to
errors in predicting the $z=0$ evolved mass.

Our goal is to predict the power spectrum of the spatial fluctuations that

associate UV emission and dust properties with the halos, computing the
emission from the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and the intergalactic
medium (IGM), including the effects of reionization, self-consistently. The
Ly$\alpha$ intensity from the diffuse IGM emission is 1.3 (2.0) times more
intense than the ISM emission at $z = 4(7)$; both components are fair tracers
of the star-forming galaxy distribution. However the power spectrum is
dominated by ISM emission on small scales ($k > 0.01 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) with
shot noise being significant only above $k = 1 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. At very lange
scales ($k < 0.01h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) diffuse IGM emission becomes important. The

2011dh in M51, spanning 86 days of its evolution. The first epoch was obtained
9 days after the explosion, when the photosphere was still in the depleted
hydrogen layer of the stripped-envelope progenitor. Continuum polarization is
securely detected at the level of P~0.5% through day 14 and appears to diminish
by day 30, which is different from the prevailing trends suggested by studies
of other core-collapse SNe. Time-variable modulations in P and position angle
are detected across P-Cygni line features. H-alpha and HeI polarization peak
after 30 days and exhibit position angles roughly aligned with the earlier
continuum, while OI and CaII appear to be geometrically distinct. We discuss
several possibilities to explain the evolution of the continuum and line
polarization, including the potential effects of a tidally deformed progenitor
star, aspherical radioactive heating by fast-rising plumes of Ni-56 from the
core, oblique shock breakout, or scattering by circumstellar material. While
these possibilities are plausible and guided by theoretical expectations, they
are not unique solutions to the data. The construction of more detailed
hydrodynamic and radiative-transfer models that incorporate complex aspherical
geometries will be required to further elucidate the nature of the polarized
radiation from SN 2011dh and other Type IIb supernovae.

star-forming galaxies of diverse masses, sizes, and morphologies: the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds, NGC 4214, NGC 4449, M83, M51, and the Antennae. These
cluster mass functions (CMFs) are well represented by power laws, dN/dM~M^b,
with similar exponents b=-1.92+/-0.27, but with amplitudes that differ by
factors up to ~10^3, corresponding to vast differences in the sizes of the
cluster populations in these galaxies. We then normalize these CMFs by the SFRs
in the galaxies, derived from dust-corrected H-alpha luminosities, and find
that the spread in the amplitudes collapses, with a remaining rms deviation of
only sigma_(logA)= 0.2. This is close to the expected dispersion from random
uncertainties in the CMFs and SFRs. Thus, the data presented here are
consistent with exact proportionality between the formation rates of stars and
clusters. However, the data also permit weak deviations from proportionality,
at the factor of two level, within the statistical uncertainties. We find the
same spread in amplitudes when we normalize the mass functions of much older
clusters, with ages in the range 100 to 400 Myr, by the current SFR. This is
another indication of the general similarity among the cluster populations of
different galaxies.

intermediate-resolution (R~6000-11000) optical (600-1000 nm) and near-infrared
(1000-2480nm) spectra of each component of Luhman16AB, the closest brown dwarf
binary to the Sun, with the X-Shooter instrument on the Very Large Telescope.
We classify the primary and secondary of the Luhman16 system as L6-L7.5 and
T0+/-1, respectively, in agreement with previous measurements published in the
literature. We present measurements of the lithium pseudo-equivalent widths,
which appears of similar strength on both components (8.2+/-1.0 Angstroms and
8.4+/-1.5 Angstroms for the L and T components, respectively). The presence of
lithium (Lithium 7) in both components imply masses below 0.06 Msun while
comparison with models suggests lower limits of 0.04 Msun. The detection of
lithium in the T component is the first of its kind. Similarly, we assess the
strength of other alkali lines (e.g. pseudo-equivalent widths of 6-7 Angstroms
for RbI and 4-7 Angstroms for CsI) present in the optical and near-infrared
regions and compare with estimates for L and T dwarfs. We also derive effective
temperatures and luminosities of each component of the binary: -4.66+/-0.08 dex

binary does not appear to belong to any of the well-known moving group. Our
preliminary theoretical analysis of the optical and J-band spectra indicates
that the L- and T-type spectra can be reproduced with a single temperature and
gravity but different relative chemical abundances which impact strongly the
spectral energy distribution of L/T transition objects.

the planet-star mass ratio ~1 x 10^{-3}. Intensive photometric observations of
a high-magnification microlensing event allow us to detect a clear signal of
the planet. Although no parallax signal is detected in the light curve, we
instead succeed at detecting the flux from the host star in high-resolution
JHK'-band images obtained by the Subaru/AO188 and IRCS instruments, allowing us
to constrain the absolute physical parameters of the planetary system. With the
help of a spectroscopic information about the source star obtained during the
high-magnification state by Bensby et al., we find that the lens system is
located at 1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8} kpc from us, and consists of an M dwarf
(0.34^{+0.12}_{-0.20} M_sun) orbited by a Saturn-mass planet
(0.39^{+0.14}_{-0.23} M_Jup) at the projected separation of
0.74^{+0.26}_{-0.42} AU (close model) or 4.3^{+1.5}_{-2.5} AU (wide model). The
probability of contamination in the host star's flux, which would reduce the
masses by a factor of up to three, is estimated to be 17%. This possibility can
be tested by future high-resolution imaging. We also estimate the (J-Ks) and
(H-Ks) colors of the host star, which are marginally consistent with a low
metallicity mid-to-early M dwarf, although further observations are required
for the metallicity to be conclusive. This is the fifth sub-Jupiter-mass
(0.2<m_p/M_Jup<1) microlensing planet around an M dwarf with the mass well
constrained. The relatively rich harvest of sub-Jupiters around M dwarfs is
contrasted with a possible paucity of ~1--2 Jupiter-mass planets around the
same type of star, which can be explained by the planetary formation process in
the core-accretion scheme.

was derived that is based on the numerical determination of the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the long-range interaction Hamiltonian. With this potential
model, which does not include adjustable parameters, all experimental

theory are developed. The method is demonstrated on the three dimensional
Hubbard model. The key technical issues are defining a mapping of an input
function to an output function, and distinguishing metallic from insulating
solutions. Both metallic and Mott insulator solutions can be predicted. The
validity of the machine learning scheme is assessed by comparing predictions of
full correlation functions, of quasi-particle weight and particle density to
values directly computed. The results indicate that with modest further
development, machine learning approach may be an attractive computational
efficient option for real materials predictions for strongly correlated
systems.

robust, space efficient, and easy to accumulate. We construct a system of
overdamped Langevin equations in the quaternion representation that accounts
for hydrodynamic effects, preserves the unit-norm constraint on the quaternion,
and is time reversible with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at
equilibrium. We introduce two schemes for temporal integration of the
overdamped Langevin equations of motion, one based on the Fixman midpoint
method and the other based on a random finite difference approach, both of
which ensure the correct stochastic drift term is captured in a computationally
efficient way. We study several examples of rigid colloidal particles diffusing
near a no-slip boundary, and demonstrate the importance of the choice of
tracking point on the measured translational mean square displacement (MSD). We
examine the average short-time as well as the long-time quasi-two-dimensional
diffusion coefficient of a rigid particle sedimented near a bottom wall due to
gravity. For several particle shapes we find a choice of tracking point that
makes the MSD essentially linear with time, allowing us to estimate the
long-time diffusion coefficient efficiently using a Monte Carlo method.
However, in general such a special choice of tracking point does not exist, and
numerical techniques for simulating long trajectories, such as the ones we
introduce here, are necessary to study diffusion on long timescales.

Carries occur also when addition is done modulo $m^2$, with $A$ chosen as a set

the charged particles in the events and combined with the magnetic field to

region closest to the interaction point. The Level-1 (real-time) pixel based
tracking trigger is a novel trigger system that is currently being studied for
the LHC upgrade. An important goal is developing real-time track reconstruction
algorithms able to cope with very high rates and high flux of data in a very

precisely identifying the primary vertex of the rare physics events from the

back has been real due to the advent of the new emerging X-ray Free Electron

June 2009 at SLAC National Lab at Stanford, the very first few experiments
being conducted on larger objects such as viruses. Many of the important
structures of nature such as helical viruses or deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)
consist of helical repetition of biological subunits. Hence development of
method for reconstructing helical structure from collected XFEL data has been a
top priority research. In this work we have developed a method for solving
helical structure such as TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) from a set of randomly
oriented simulated diffraction patterns exploiting symmetry and Fourier space

an important role in the generation of two-phase patterns during the
solidification of eutectic alloys. In particular, in lamellar composites, large
patches of perfectly aligned lamellae are frequently observed. Moreover, the
growth direction of the lamellae often markedly differs from the direction of
the temperature gradient (the lamellae are tilted with respect to the main
growth direction). Both of these effects cannot be explained either by the
standard theory or the available numerical models of eutectic growth, which all
assume the interfaces to be isotropic. We have developed a phase-field model in
which the anisotropy of each interface (solid-liquid and solid-solid) can be
separately controlled, and we have investigated the effect of interface
anisotropy on the growth dynamics. We have found that anisotropy of the
solid-solid interphase boundary free energy dramatically alters the growth
dynamics. Tilted lamellae result from the modified equilibrium condition at the
triple lines, in good agreement with a theoretical conjecture proposed
recently. In three dimensions, the interphase boundaries tend to align with
directions of minimal energy. We have also performed simulations in which two
grains with different anisotropies are in competition. In all cases, the grain
containing the boundaries with the lowest energies was selected after a
transient. These results shed new light on the selection of growth patterns in

source terminals, one shared relay, and a common destination with multi-packet
reception (MPR) capability. In this paper, we study the stability and delay
analysis for two cooperative relaying schemes; the sensing-based cooperative
(SBC) scheme and the decision-based cooperative (DBC) scheme. In the SBC
scheme, the relay senses the channel at the beginning of each time slot. In the
idle time slots, the relay transmits the packet at the head of its queue, while
in the busy one, the relay decides either to transmit simultaneously with the
source terminal or to listen to the source transmission. The SBC scheme is a
novel paradigm that utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than the other
cooperative schemes because the relay not only exploits the idle time slots,
but also has the capability to mildly interfere with the source terminal. On
the other hand, in the DBC scheme, the relay does not sense the channel and it
decides either to transmit or to listen according to certain probabilities.
Numerical results reveal that the two proposed schemes outperform existing
cooperative schemes that restrict the relay to send only in the idle time
slots. Moreover, we show how the MPR capability at the destination can
compensate for the sensing need at the relay, i.e., the DBC scheme achieves
almost the same stability region as that of the SBC scheme. Furthermore, we
derive the condition under which the two proposed schemes achieve the same
maximum stable throughput.

compressing human mocap data with low latency. The first framework processes
the data in a frame-by-frame manner so that it is ideal for mocap data
streaming and time critical applications. The second one is clip-based and
provides a flexible tradeoff between latency and compression performance. Since
mocap data exhibits some unique spatial characteristics, we propose a very
effective transform, namely learned orthogonal transform (LOT), for reducing
the spatial redundancy. The LOT problem is formulated as minimizing square
error regularized by orthogonality and sparsity and solved via alternating
iteration. We also adopt a predictive coding and temporal DCT for temporal
decorrelation in the frame- and clip-based frameworks, respectively.
Experimental results show that the proposed frameworks can produce higher

when their characteristic probing depth is adequately taken into account. The
intermetallic film thickness serves as an effective tuning parameter which
brings about characteristic variations of the Cerium valence and related
properties. Soft x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
prove well suited to trace the changing Ce valence and to assess relevant
aspects of Kondo physics in the CePt$_5$ surface intermetallic. We find
characteristic Kondo scales of the order of 10$^2$ K and evidence for
considerable magnetic Kondo screening of the local Ce $4f$ moments.
CePt$_5$/Pt(111) and related systems therefore appear to be promising

of PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the
computation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of

  Clause-Learning SAT Solvers",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conflict-Driven Clause-Learning SAT solvers crucially depend on the Variable
State Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS) branching heuristic for their
performance. Although VSIDS was proposed nearly fifteen years ago, and many
other branching heuristics for SAT solving have since been proposed, VSIDS
remains one of the most effective branching heuristics.
  In this paper, we advance our understanding of VSIDS by answering the
following key questions. The first question we pose is ""what is special about
the class of variables that VSIDS chooses to additively bump?"" In answering
this question we showed that VSIDS overwhelmingly picks, bumps, and learns
bridge variables, defined as the variables that connect distinct communities in
the community structure of SAT instances. This is surprising since VSIDS was
invented more than a decade before the link between community structure and SAT
solver performance was discovered. Additionally, we show that VSIDS viewed as a
ranking function correlates strongly with temporal graph centrality measures.
Putting these two findings together, we conclude that VSIDS picks
high-centrality bridge variables. The second question we pose is ""what role
does multiplicative decay play in making VSIDS so effective?"" We show that the
multiplicative decay behaves like an exponential moving average (EMA) that
favors variables that persistently occur in conflicts (the signal) over
variables that occur intermittently (the noise). The third question we pose is
""whether VSIDS is temporally and spatially focused."" We show that VSIDS
disproportionately picks variables from a few communities unlike, say, the
random branching heuristic. We put these findings together to invent a new
adaptive VSIDS branching heuristic that solves more instances than one of the
best-known VSIDS variants over the SAT Competition 2013 benchmarks.

a classical sequential decision problem with broad applications. However, the
optimal solution remains, in general, unknown as the dynamic program suffers
from the curse of dimensionality in the posterior belief space. We consider a
class of practical problems in which the observation distributions associated
with different classes are related through exponential tilting, and show that
the reachable beliefs could be restricted on, or near, a set of
low-dimensional, time-dependent manifolds with closed-form expressions. This
sparsity is driven by the low dimensionality of the observation distributions
(which is intuitive) as well as by specific structural interrelations among
them (which is less intuitive). We use a matrix factorization approach to
uncover the potential low dimensionality hidden in high-dimensional beliefs and
reconstruct the beliefs using a diagnostic statistic in lower dimension. For
common univariate distributions, e.g., normal, binomial, and Poisson, the
belief reconstruction is exact, and the optimal policies can be efficiently
computed for a large number of classes. We also characterize the structure of
the optimal policy in the reduced dimension. For multivariate distributions, we
propose a low-rank matrix approximation scheme that works well when the beliefs
are near the low-dimensional manifolds. The optimal policy significantly

numbers: Hubble parameter ${{H}_{0}}$ and deceleration parameter ${{q}_{0}}$.
The first of the two basic cosmological parameters (the Hubble parameter)
describes the linear part of the time dependence of the scale factor. Treating
the Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is
non-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while
non-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of
the Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon
as the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which
determine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the
Universe' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both
static and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$
and ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale
factor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological
expansion.
  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the
Universe. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion
rate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy
number variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this
number either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to
stay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).
  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- ""Cosmology
in terms of the deceleration parameter"". We would like to show that practically
any aspect of the cosmological evolution is tightly bound to the deceleration
parameter. It is the second part of the report. The first part see here

revision and introduced some specific operators. In this paper, a constructive
characterization of all rational LP revision operators is given in terms of
orderings over propositional interpretations with some further conditions
specific to SE interpretations. It provides an intuitive, complete procedure
for the construction of all rational LP revision operators and makes easier the
comprehension of their semantic and computational properties. We give a
particular consideration to logic programs of very general form, i.e., the
generalized logic programs (GLPs). We show that every rational GLP revision
operator is derived from a propositional revision operator satisfying the
original AGM postulates. Interestingly, the further conditions specific to GLP
revision are independent from the propositional revision operator on which a
GLP revision operator is based. Taking advantage of our characterization
result, we embed the GLP revision operators into structures of Boolean
lattices, that allow us to bring to light some potential weaknesses in the
adapted AGM postulates. To illustrate our claim, we introduce and characterize
axiomatically two specific classes of (rational) GLP revision operators which
arguably have a drastic behavior. We additionally consider two more restricted
forms of logic programs, i.e., the disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) and the
normal logic programs (NLPs) and adapt our characterization result to DLP and

that cover the entire solar surface (the `salt and pepper' patterns in

find that these fields result from a local dynamo action in the top layers of
the convection zone, where extremely weak 'seed' magnetic fields (e.g., from a
$10^{-6}$ G) can locally grow above the mean equipartition field, to a stronger
than 2000~G field localized in magnetic structures. Our results reveal that the
magnetic flux is predominantly generated in regions of small-scale helical
downflows. We find that the local dynamo action takes place mostly in a
shallow, about 500~km deep, subsurface layer, from which the generated field is
transported into the deeper layers by convective downdrafts. We demonstrate
that the observed dominance of vertical magnetic fields at the photosphere and
horizontal fields above the photosphere can be explained by small-scale
magnetic loops produced by the dynamo. Such small-scale loops play an important
role in the structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere and that their
detection in observations is critical for understanding the local dynamo action
on the Sun.

We are assuming an alternative explanation. The growing up of cluster size
still goes on but the width of MQ spectrum becomes stable because of different

prepared by faraway separated partners and transferred to the third partner who
carries out Bell basis measurement on them to post-select the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. If some loopholes open, similar as that in
normal Bell test, the Bell violation in the present protocol is apt to be
interpreted with local hidden variable (lhv) theory. With some modifications on
the protocol, the lhvs at both sides are prevented to exchange their
information. Thus they only function locally and cannot affect the behaviors of
the states at the other sides. However, Bell violation can still be obtained in
this case. It means that Bell violation is realized with the lhv theory
excluded. Because high detection efficiency is not compulsory, this protocol
can be realized with present technology.

reduction, extracting latent factors and learning part-based representation.
For large datasets, NMF performance depends on some major issues: fast
algorithms, fully parallel distributed feasibility and limited internal memory.
This research aims to design a fast fully parallel and distributed algorithm
using limited internal memory to reach high NMF performance for large datasets.
In particular, we propose a flexible accelerated algorithm for NMF with all its
$L_1$ $L_2$ regularized variants based on full decomposition, which is a
combination of an anti-lopsided algorithm and a fast block coordinate descent
algorithm. The proposed algorithm takes advantages of both these algorithms to
achieve a linear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1-\frac{1}{||Q||_2})^k$ in
optimizing each factor matrix when fixing the other factor one in the sub-space
of passive variables, where $r$ is the number of latent components; where
$\sqrt{r} \leq ||Q||_2 \leq r$. In addition, the algorithm can exploit the data
sparseness to run on large datasets with limited internal memory of machines.
Furthermore, our experimental results are highly competitive with 7
state-of-the-art methods about three significant aspects of convergence,
optimality and average of the iteration number. Therefore, the proposed
algorithm is superior to fast block coordinate descent methods and accelerated
methods.

shows power law decay upon heating. Unlike a classical soft mode, it saturates

standard diffraction techniques, yet contain the same local motif as the room

eigenvalues. Finally, we corroborate the relevant stability picture through
direct numerical computations. In the latter, we observe the prototypical
manifestation of these instabilities to be the spontaneous rearrangement of the
solution, for larger values of the coupling, into localized waveforms typically
centered over fewer sites than the original unstable structure. For weak
coupling, the instability appears to result in a robust breathing of the

orbital ordering (between d$_{yz}$ and d$_{xz}$ bands) takes place due to local
breaking of in-plane symmetry that generates two non-equivalent $a$, $b$
directions in 122 family of Fe-based superconductors. Orbital ordering is
strongly anisotropic and the temperature dependence of the corner zone orbital
order maps to that of the orthorhombicity parameter. Orbital anisotropy results
in two distinct spin density wave nesting wave vectors and causes inter-orbital
charge and spin fluctuations. Temperature dependence of the orbital order is
proportional to the nematic order and it sets in at a temperature where
magnetic fluctuation starts building. Magnetic fluctuations in the orthorhombic
phase is characterized through evolution of Stoner factor which reproduces
experimentalfindings very accurately. Orbital ordering becomes strongly spin
dependent in presence of magnetic interaction. Occupation probabilities of all
the Fe-d-orbitals exhibit temperature dependence indicating their possible
contribution in orbital fluctuation. This need to be contrasted with the usual
definition of nematic order parameter (n$_{d_{xz}}$-n$_{d_{yz}}$). Relationship
among orbital fluctuations, magnetic fluctuations and nematicity are
established.

increasing centrality. Combined blast-wave fits of several particles support
the interpretation that this behavior is caused by an increase of radial flow.
The integrated particle yields are discussed in the context of coalescence and
thermal-statistical model expectations. The particle ratios, $^3$He/d and
$^3$He/p, in Pb-Pb collisions are found to be in agreement with a common
chemical freeze-out temperature of $T_{\rm chem} \approx 156$ MeV. These ratios
do not vary with centrality which is in agreement with the thermal-statistical
model. In a coalescence approach, it excludes models in which nucleus
production is proportional to the particle multiplicity and favors those in
which it is proportional to the particle density instead. In addition, the
observation of 31 anti-tritons in Pb-Pb collisions is reported. For comparison,
the deuteron spectrum in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is also presented.
While the p/$\pi$ ratio is similar in pp and Pb-Pb collisions, the d/p ratio in

challenges to the availability of online services today. These DDoS attacks
overwhelm the victim with huge volume of traffic and render it incapable of
performing normal communication or crashes it completely. If there are delays
in detecting the flooding attacks, nothing much can be done except to manually
disconnect the victim and fix the problem. With the rapid increase of DDoS
volume and frequency, the current DDoS detection technologies are challenged to
deal with huge attack volume in reasonable and affordable response time.
  In this paper, we propose HADEC, a Hadoop based Live DDoS Detection framework
to tackle efficient analysis of flooding attacks by harnessing MapReduce and
HDFS. We implemented a counter-based DDoS detection algorithm for four major
flooding attacks (TCP-SYN, HTTP GET, UDP and ICMP) in MapReduce, consisting of
map and reduce functions. We deployed a testbed to evaluate the performance of
HADEC framework for live DDoS detection. Based on the experiments we showed
that HADEC is capable of processing and detecting DDoS attacks in affordable
time.

graphene. First, Dirac electrons in graphene exhibit a giant global proximity
spin-orbit coupling, without compromising the semimetallic character of the
whole system at zero field. Remarkably, these spin-orbit effects can be very
accurately described by a simple effective Hamiltonian. Second, the Fermi level
can be tuned by a transverse electric field to cross the MoS$_2$ conduction
band, creating a system of coupled massive and massles electron gases. Both
charge and spin transport in such systems should be unique. Finally, we propose
to use graphene/TMDC structures as a platform for optospintronics, in
particular for optical spin injection into graphene and for studying spin
transfer between TMDC and graphene.

using our cosmological simulations, where super-massive black holes originate
from the first stars. In the most massive galaxy, we have identified two strong
outflows unambiguously driven by AGN feedback. These outflows have a speed
greater than $\sim 8000$ km\,s$^{-1}$ near the AGN, and travel out to a half
Mpc with $\sim 3000$ km\,s$^{-1}$. These outflows remove the remaining gas
($\sim 3$ per cent of baryons) and significant amounts of metals ($\sim 2$ per
cent of total produced metals) from the host galaxy, chemically enriching the
circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intergalactic medium (IGM). 17.6 per cent
of metals from this galaxy, and 18.4 per cent of total produced metals in the
simulation, end up in the CGM and IGM, respectively. The metallicities of the
CGM and IGM are higher with AGN feedback, while the mass--metallicity relation
of galaxies is not affected very much. We also find `selective' mass-loss where
iron is more effectively ejected than oxygen because of the time-delay of Type
Ia Supernovae. AGN-driven outflows play an essential role not only in quenching
of star formation in massive galaxies to match with observed down-sizing
phenomena, but also in a large-scale chemical enrichment in the Universe.
Observational constraints of metallicities and elemental abundance ratios in
outflows are important to test the modelling of AGN feedback in galaxy
formation.

However, direct evidence of the dissipation process of these waves and

spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution observations of a solar prominence
that show a compelling signature of so-called resonant absorption, a long
hypothesized mechanism to efficiently convert and dissipate transverse wave
energy into heat. Aside from coherence in the transverse direction, our
observations show telltale phase differences around 180 degrees between
transverse motions in the plane-of-sky and line-of-sight velocities of the
oscillating fine structures or threads, and also suggest significant heating
from chromospheric to higher temperatures. Comparison with advanced numerical
simulations support a scenario in which transverse oscillations trigger a
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) at the boundaries of oscillating threads via
resonant absorption. This instability leads to numerous thin current sheets in
which wave energy is dissipated and plasma is heated. Our results provide
direct evidence for wave-related heating in action, one of the candidate
coronal heating mechanisms.

  MNRAS. Corrected typos in the Abstract",,"10.1093/mnras/stv1452",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the physical and evolutionary properties of the ""WD family"" of AM
CVn stars by computing realistic models of IDD systems. We evaluate
self-consistently both the mass transfer rate from the donor, as determined by
GW emission and interaction with the binary companion, and the thermal response
of the accretor to mass deposition. We find that, after the onset of mass
transfer, all the considered systems undergo a strong non-dynamical He-flash.
However, due to the compactness of these systems, the expanding accretors fill
their Roche lobe very soon, thus preventing the efficient heating of the
external layers of the accreted CO WDs. Moreover, due to the loss of matter
from the systems, the orbital separations enlarge and mass transfer comes to a
halt. The further evolution depends on the value of $\dot{M}$, after the donors
fill again their lobe. On one hand, if the accretion rate, as determined by the
actual value of (M$_{don}$,M$_{acc}$), is high enough, the accretors experience
several He-flashes of decreasing strength and then quiescent He-burning sets
in. Later on, since the mass transfer rate in IDD is a permanently decreasing
function of time, accretors experience several recurrent strong flashes. On the
other hand, for intermediate and low values of $\dot{M}$, the accretors enter
the strong flashes accretion regime. As expected, in all the considered systems
the last He-flash is the strongest one, even if a dynamical event never occurs.
When the mass accretion rate decreases below (2-3)$\times 10^{-8} M_\odot
yr^{-1}$, the compressional heating of the He-shell becomes less efficient than
the neutrino cooling, so that all the accretors in the considered systems
evolve into massive degenerate objects. Our results suggest that SNe .Ia or
type Ia Supernovae due to Edge-Lit Detonation in the WD family of AM CVn stars
should be much more rare than previously expected.

It is made of three main steps : first a splitting procedure for the
subdivision of clusters into two subclusters, second a local evaluation of the
bipartitions resulting from the tentative splits and, third, a formula for
determining the nodes levels of the resulting dendrogram. A number of such
algorithms is given. These algorithms are compared using the Goodman-Kruskal
correlation coefficient. As a global criterion it is an internal
goodness-of-fit measure based on the set order induced by the hierarchy
compared to the order associated to the given dissimilarities. Applied to a
hundred of random data tables, these comparisons are in favor of two methods
based on unusual ratio-type formulas for the splitting procedures, namely the
Silhouette criterion and Dunn's criterion. These two criteria take into account
both the within cluster and the between cluster mean dissimilarity. In general
the results of these two algorithms are better than the classical Agglomerative
Average Link method.

  Indeed, hybrid systems are often encountered in quantum information

receive inputs (actions) from the outer world. We show the language equivalence

seesaw model in the nondegenerate case. In this work, we further study the pair
and associated production of the neutral scalars H^0/A^0. We restrict ourselves
to the so-called negative scenario characterized by the mass order
M_{H^{\pm\pm}}>M_{H^\pm}>M_{H^0/A^0}, in which the H^0/A^0 production receives
significant enhancement from cascade decays of the charged scalars
H^{\pm\pm},~H^\pm. We consider three important signal
channels---b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma, b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-,
$b\bar{b}\ell^+\ell^-\cancel{E}_T$---and perform detailed simulations. We find
that at the 14 TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of 3000/fb, a 5\sigma mass
reach of 151, 150, and 180 GeV, respectively, is possible in the three channels
from the pure Drell-Yan H^0A^0 production, while the cascade-decay-enhanced
H^0/A^0 production can push the mass limit further to 164, 177, and 200 GeV.
The neutral scalars in the negative scenario are thus accessible at LHC run II.

interacting particles confined in a quasi-one-dimensional channel, and the
effect of the interparticle interaction as well as the functional form of the
confinement potential on those transitions are investigated. Although the
non-sequential ordering of transitions (non-SOT), i.e.
$1$-$2$-$4$-$3$-$4$-$5$-$6$-$...$ sequence of chain configurations with
increasing density, is widely robust as predicted in a number of theoretical
studies, the sequential ordering of transitions (SOT),
i.e.~$1$-$2$-$3$-$4$-$5$-$6$-$...$ chain, is found as the ground state for
long-ranged interparticle interaction and hard-wall-like confinement
potentials. We found an energy barrier between every two different phases
around its transition point, which plays an important role in the preference of
the system to follow either a SOT or a non-SOT. However, that preferential
transition requires also the stability of the phases during the transition.
Additionally, we analyze the effect of a small structural disorder on the
transition between the two phases around its transition point. Our results show
that a small deformation of the triangular structure, change dramatically the
picture of the transition between two phases, removing in a considerable region
the non-SOT in the system. This feature could explain the fact that the non-SOT
is, up to now, not observed in experimental systems, and suggests a more
advanced experimental set-up to detect the non-SOT.

formation and evolution, while the feedback from AGN is thought to regulate the
BH-bulge coevolution and the star formation process. In this context, we
focused on 1SXPSJ050819.8+172149, a local (z=0.0175) Seyfert 1.9 galaxy
(L_bol~4x10^43 ergs/s). The source belongs to an IR-luminous interacting pair
of galaxies, characterized by a luminosity for the whole system (due to the
combination of star formation and accretion) of log(L_IR/L_sun)=11.2. We
present the first detailed description of the 0.3-10keV spectrum of
1SXPSJ050819.8+172149, monitored by Swift with 9 pointings performed in less
than 1 month. The X-ray emission of 1SXPSJ050819.8+172149 is analysed by
combining all the Swift pointings, for a total of ~72ks XRT net exposure. The
averaged Swift-BAT spectrum from the 70-month survey is also analysed. The
slope of the continuum is ~1.8, with an intrinsic column density NH~2.4x10^22
cm-2, and a deabsorbed luminosity L(2-10keV)~4x10^42 ergs/s. Our observations
provide a tentative (2.1sigma) detection of a blue-shifted FeXXVI absorption
line (rest-frame E~7.8 keV), suggesting the discovery for a new candidate
powerful wind in this source. The physical properties of the outflow cannot be
firmly assessed, due to the low statistics of the spectrum and to the observed
energy of the line, too close to the higher boundary of the Swift-XRT bandpass.
However, our analysis suggests that, if the detection is confirmed, the line
could be associated with a high-velocity (vout~0.1c) outflow most likely
launched within 80r_S. To our knowledge this is the first detection of a
previously unknown ultrafast wind with Swift. The high NH suggested by the
observed equivalent width of the line (EW~ -230eV, although with large
uncertainties), would imply a kinetic output strong enough to be comparable to
the AGN bolometric luminosity.

H-band is important for the design of faint-object infrared spectrographs.
Existing spectra at low/medium resolution cannot disentangle the true
sky-continuum from instrumental effects (e.g. diffuse light in the wings of
strong lines). We aim to obtain, for the first time, a high resolution infrared
spectrum deep enough to set significant constraints on the continuum emission
between the lines in the H-band. Methods During the second commissioning run of
the GIANO high-resolution infrared spectrograph at La Palma Observatory, we
pointed the instrument directly to the sky and obtained a deep spectrum that
extends from 0.97 to 2.4 micron. Results The spectrum shows about 1500 emission
lines, a factor of two more than in previous works. Of these, 80% are
identified as OH transitions; half of these are from highly excited molecules
(hot-OH component) that are not included in the OH airglow emission models
normally used for astronomical applications. The other lines are attributable
to O2 or unidentified. Several of the faint lines are in spectral regions that
were previously believed to be free of line emission. The continuum in the
H-band is marginally detected at a level of about 300
photons/m^2/s/arcsec^2/micron, equivalent to 20.1 AB-mag/arcsec^2. The observed
spectrum and the list of observed sky-lines are published in electronic format.
Conclusions Our measurements indicate that the sky continuum in the H-band
could be even darker than previously believed. However, the myriad of airglow
emission lines severely limits the spectral ranges where very low background
can be effectively achieved with low/medium resolution spectrographs. We
identify a few spectral bands that could still remain quite dark at the
resolving power foreseen for VLT-MOONS (R ~6,600).

  comparison to an experimental ""molecular vice""",,,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DNA bending is biologically important for genome regulation and is relevant
to a range of nanotechnological systems. Recent results suggest that sharp
bending is much easier than implied by the widely-used worm-like chain model;
many of these studies, however, remain controversial. We use a coarse-grained
model, previously fitted to DNA's basic thermodynamic and mechanical
properties, to explore strongly bent systems. We find that as the end-to-end
distance is decreased sufficiently short duplexes undergo a transition to a
state in which the bending strain is localized at a flexible kink that involves
disruption of base-pairing and stacking. This kinked state, which is not
well-described by the worm-like chain model, allows the duplex to more easily
be sharply bent. It is not completely flexible, however, due to constraints
arising from the connectivity of both DNA backbones. We also perform a detailed
comparison to recent experiments on a ""molecular vice"" that probes highly bent
DNA. Close agreement between simulations and experiments strengthens the
hypothesis that localised bending via kinking occurs in the molecular vice and
causes enhanced flexibility of duplex DNA. Our calculations therefore suggests
that the cost of kinking implied by this experiment is consistent with the
known thermodynamic and mechanical properties of DNA.

DNA bending. The worm-like chain model provides a good description of small to
moderate bending fluctuations, but some experiments on strongly-bent shorter
molecules suggest enhanced flexibility over and above that expected from the
worm-like chain. Here, we use a coarse-grained model of DNA to investigate the
thermodynamics of DNA cyclization for molecules with less than 210 base pairs.
As the molecules get shorter we find increasing deviations between our computed
equilibrium j-factor and the worm-like chain predictions of Shimada and
Yamakawa. These deviations are due to sharp kinking, first at nicks, and only
subsequently in the body of the duplex. At the shortest lengths, substantial
fraying at the ends of duplex domains is the dominant method of relaxation. We
also estimate the dynamic j-factor measured in recent FRET experiments. We find
that the dynamic j-factor is systematically larger than its equilibrium
counterpart, with the deviation larger for shorter molecules, because not all
the stress present in the fully cyclized state is present in the transition
state. These observations are important for the interpretation of recent
experiments, as only kinking within the body of the duplex is genuinely
indicative of non-worm-like chain behaviour.

of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Therefore, it could be used as an
effective tracer of the magnetic field evolution of magnetized plasmas.
Theoretical estimations indicate that magnetic helicity is also essentially
conserved with non-ideal MHD processes, e.g. magnetic reconnection. This
conjecture has however been barely tested, either experimentally or
numerically. Thanks to recent advances in magnetic helicity estimation methods,
it is now possible to test numerically its dissipation level in general
three-dimensional datasets. We first revisit the general formulation of the
temporal variation of relative magnetic helicity on a fully bounded volume when
no hypothesis on the gauge are made. We introduce a method to precisely
estimate its dissipation independently of the type of non-ideal MHD processes
occurring. In a solar-like eruptive event simulation, using different gauges,
we compare its estimation in a finite volume with its time-integrated flux
through the boundaries, hence testing the conservation and dissipation of
helicity. We provide an upper bound of the real dissipation of magnetic
helicity: It is quasi-null during the quasi-ideal MHD phase. Even when magnetic
reconnection is acting the relative dissipation of magnetic helicity is also
very small (<2.2%), in particular compared to the relative dissipation of
magnetic energy (>30 times larger). We finally illustrate how the helicity-flux
terms involving velocity components are gauge dependent, hence limiting their
physical meaning.

for online optimization in machine learning. In this work, we accelerate SGD by
adaptively learning how to sample the most useful training examples at each

sampling distribution of an importance sampling estimator. Second, we show that
the sampling distribution of an SGD algorithm can be estimated online by
incrementally minimizing the variance of the gradient. The resulting algorithm
- called Adaptive Weighted SGD (AW-SGD) - maintains a set of parameters to
optimize, as well as a set of parameters to sample learning examples. We show
that AWSGD yields faster convergence in three different applications: (i) image
classification with deep features, where the sampling of images depends on
their labels, (ii) matrix factorization, where rows and columns are not sampled
uniformly, and (iii) reinforcement learning, where the optimized and
exploration policies are estimated at the same time, where our approach
corresponds to an off-policy gradient algorithm.

of the two vector fields, to a three-dimensional nonlinear sigma model coupled
to gravity, whose target space is a noncompact version of
$\mathbb{C}\text{P}^2$ with SU(2,1) isometry group. It is shown that the
potential for the scalars, that arises from the cosmological constant in four
dimensions, breaks three of the eight SU(2,1) symmetries, corresponding to the
generalized Ehlers and the two Harrison transformations. This leaves a
semidirect product of a one-dimensional Heisenberg group and a translation
group $\mathbb{R}^2$ as residual symmetry. We show that, under the additional
assumptions that the three-dimensional manifold is conformal to a product space
$\mathbb{R}\times\Sigma$, and all fields depend only on the coordinate along
$\mathbb{R}$, the equations of motion are integrable. This generalizes the
results of Leigh et al. in arXiv:1403.6511 to the case where also
electromagnetic fields are present. In the second part of the paper we consider
the purely gravitational spacetime admitting a second Killing vector that
commutes with the timelike one. We write down the resulting two-dimensional
action and discuss its symmetries. If the fields depend only on one of the two

Broadcast Channel with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT), a class of Rate-Splitting (RS) approaches has been proposed recently,
which divides one receiver's message into a common and a private part, and
superposes the common message on top of Zero-Forcing precoded private messages.
In this paper, with quantized CSIT, we study the ergodic sum rate of two
schemes, namely RS-S and RS-ST, where the common message(s) are transmitted via
a space and space-time design, respectively. Firstly, we upper-bound the sum
rate loss incurred by each scheme relative to Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF)
with perfect CSIT. Secondly, we show that, to maintain a constant sum rate
loss, RS-S scheme enables a feedback overhead reduction over ZFBF with
quantized CSIT. Such reduction scales logarithmically with the constant rate
loss at high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR). We also find that, compared to RS-S
scheme, RS-ST scheme offers a further feedback overhead reduction that scales
with the discrepancy between the feedback overhead employed by the two
receivers when there are alternating receiver-specific feedback qualities.
Finally, simulation results show that both schemes offer a significant SNR gain
over conventional single-user/multiuser mode switching when the feedback
overhead is fixed.

thermal equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) fit of the spectrum in order to
identify the molecular species and derive column densities and excitation
temperatures. We derive molecular abundances and compare them with other
Galactic and extragalactic sources by means of a principal component analysis.
We detect 317 emission lines from a total of 45 molecular species, including 15
isotopic substitutions and six vibrationally excited variants. Our LTE/NLTE fit
find kinetic temperatures from 20 to 350 K, and densities between 10$^5$ and
10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. The spectrum is dominated by vibrationally excited HC$_3$N,
HCN, and HNC, with vibrational temperatures from 300 to 450 K. We find high
abundances of HC$_3$N, SiO, H$_2$S, and c-HCCCH and a low CH$_3$OH abundance. A
principal component analysis shows that NGC 4418 and Arp 220 share very similar
molecular abundances and excitation, which clearly set them apart from other
Galactic and extragalactic environments. The similar molecular abundances
observed towards NCG 4418 and Arp 220 are consistent with a hot gas-phase
chemistry, with the relative abundances of SiO and CH$_3$OH being regulated by
shocks and X-ray driven dissociation. The bright emission from vibrationally
excited species confirms the presence of a compact IR source, with an effective
diameter $<$5 pc and brightness temperatures $>$350 K. The molecular abundances
and the vibrationally excited spectrum are consistent with a young
AGN/starburst system. We suggest that NGC 4418 may be a template for a new kind
of chemistry and excitation, typical of compact obscured nuclei (CON). Because
of the narrow line widths and bright molecular emission, NGC 4418 is the ideal

antibunching while colliding at an electronic wave splitter. This is in
striking difference with the dephasing-induced mixedness which suppresses
antibunching. On the contrary, a single-particle shot noise is suppressed at
finite temperatures but is not affected by pure dephasing. This work therefore
extends the investigation of the coherence properties of single-electronic

It is well known that the asymptotic behavior of the velocity field is given by
the fundamental solution of the Oseen system which is the linearization of the
Navier-Stokes equation around $\boldsymbol{u}_{\infty}$. The vorticity has the
property of decaying algebraically inside a parabolic region called the wake
and exponentially outside. The previously proven asymptotic expansions of the
vorticity are relevant only inside the wake because everywhere else the
remainder is larger than the asymptotic term. Here we present an asymptotic
expansion that removes this weakness. Surprisingly, the found asymptotic term
is not given by the Oseen linearization and has a power of decay that depends
on the data. This strange behavior is specific to the two dimensional problem

(stellar radiation). In the asymmetrical case (order 4) the stellar radiation
and interstellar gas flow are considered. It is investigated how well the
linearization solution describes real solution obtained from an equation of
motion by a comparison of the resonant libration frequency found analytically
and numerically. It is found that from initial values of the evolving orbital
parameters (semimajor axis, eccentricity, longitude of pericenter, and resonant
angular variable) in the averaged phase space the linearization frequency
depends most sensitively on the initial value of the resonant angular variable.
For small libration amplitudes of the resonant angular variable the best match
of the real libration frequency and the linearization frequency is located
approximately at the solution of the resonant condition ($da / dt$ $=$ 0). If
the initial averaged conditions are chosen close to the solution of resonant
condition, then the linearization frequency for practically all simple
oscillatory evolutions matches the real libration frequency and the
linearization solution very well approximates the real evolution.

further by recycling the leaked photon back into the cavity after flipping its

monitored via a QND measurement that heralds whether or not the photon
absorption has succeeded. Upon success we know a destructive Bell measurement
has occurred between that photon and NV center. Given low losses and a high

volume filling factor of the clouds is studied in a three-dimensional axially

ejected by the supernova and their contribution to radiative losses. The
interaction of the supernova envelope with the cloudy phase of the interstellar
medium leads to nonsimultaneous, and on average earlier, onsets of the
radiative phase in different parts of the supernova envelope. Growth in the
volume filling factor $f$ leads to a decrease in the time for the transition of
the envelope to the radiative phase and a decrease in the envelope's mean
radius, due to the increased energy losses by the envelope in the cloudy
medium. When the development of hydrodynamical instabilities in the supernova
envelope is efficient, the thermal energy falls as $E_t\sim t^{-2.3}$, for the
propagation of the supernova remnant through either a homogeneous or a cloudy
medium. When the volume filling factor is $f\simgt 0.1$, a layer with excess
kinetic energy andmomentumforms far behind the global shock front from the
supernova, which traps the hot gas of the cavity in the central part of the
supernova remnant. Metals ejected by the supernova are also enclosed in the
central region of the remnant, where the initial (high) metallicity is
essentially preserved. Thus, the interaction of the supernova envelope with the
cloudy interstellar medium appreciably changes the dynamics and structure of
the distribution of the gas in the remnant. This affects the observational
characteristics of the remnant, in particularly, leading to substantial
fluctuations of the emission measure of the gas with $T>10^5$~K and the

1000 N$_{e}$/cm$^{3}$. Using the optical characteristics of Populations A and
B, we find that 50\% of our sources with H$\beta$ broad emission are consistent
with the radio-quiet sources definition. The remaining sources could be
interpreted as low-luminosity radio-loud quasar. The BPT-based classification
renders an AGN/Seyfert activity between 50 to 60\%. For the remaining sources,
the possible star burst contribution might control the LINER and HII

differences found between data sets, although variability in the BLR could play
a significant role as well.

theories with N=1,2,3 by realising them as conformal supergravity coupled to

construct supersymmetric invariants with up to and including four derivatives.
As a warming-up exercise, we first give a new and completely geometric
derivation of such invariants in N=1 supergravity. Upon reduction to
components, they agree with those given in arXiv:0907.4658 and arXiv:1005.3952.
We then carry out a similar construction in the case of N=2 supergravity for
which there exist two minimal formulations that differ by the choice of
compensating multiplet: (i) a chiral scalar multipet; (ii) a vector multiplet.
For these formulations all four derivative invariants are constructed in
completely general and gauge independent form. For a general supergravity model
(in the N=1 and minimal N=2 cases) with curvature-squared and lower order
terms, we derive the superfield equations of motion, linearise them about
maximally supersymmetric backgrounds and obtain restrictions on the parameters
that lead to models for massive supergravity. We use the non-minimal
formulation for N = 2 supergravity (which corresponds to a complex linear
compensator) to construct a novel consistent theory of massive supergravity. In
the case of N = 3 supergravity, we employ the off-shell formulation with a
vector multiplet as compensator to construct for the first time various higher
derivative invariants. These invariants may be used to derive models for N = 3
massive supergravity. As a bi-product of our analysis, we also present
superfield equations for massive higher spin multiplets in (1,0), (1,1) and

evolutionary stages of low to intermediate-mass stars. Their vigorous mass loss
has a significant effect on the stellar evolution, and is a significant source
of heavy elements and dust grains for the interstellar medium. The mass-loss
rate can be well traced by carbon monoxide (CO) line emission.
  AIMS: We present new Herschel HIFI and IRAM 30m telescope CO line data for a
sample of 53 galactic AGB stars. The lines cover a fairly large range of
excitation energy from the $J=1\to0$ line to the $J=9\to8$ line, and even the
$J=14\to13$ line in a few cases. We perform radiative transfer modelling for 38
of these sources to estimate their mass-loss rates.
  METHODS: We used a radiative transfer code based on the Monte Carlo method to
model the CO line emission. We assume spherically symmetric circumstellar
envelopes that are formed by a constant mass-loss rate through a smoothly
accelerating wind.
  RESULTS: We find models that are consistent across a broad range of CO lines
for most of the stars in our sample, i.e., a large number of the circumstellar
envelopes can be described with a constant mass-loss rate. We also find that an
accelerating wind is required to fit, in particular, the higher-J lines and
that a velocity law will have a significant effect on the model line
intensities. The results cover a wide range of mass-loss rates ($\sim 10^{-8}$
to $2\times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot~\mathrm{ yr}^{-1}$) and gas expansion
velocities (2 to $21.5$ km s$^{-1}$), and include M-, S-, and C-type AGB stars.
Our results generally agree with those of earlier studies, although we tend to
find slightly lower mass-loss rates by about 40%, on average. We also present
""bonus"" lines detected during our CO observations.

criterion, based on which a novel model selection methodology, namely
Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) Inference, has been developed and

Process (DP) prior, and one of its well known representations, the Chinese
Restaurant Process (CRP), derive another line of model selection methods. FIC
can be viewed as a prior distribution over the latent variable configurations.
Under this view, we prove that when the parameter dimensionality $D_{c}=2$, FIC
is equivalent to CRP. We argue that when $D_{c}>2$, FIC avoids an inherent
problem of DP/CRP, i.e. the data likelihood will dominate the impact of the
prior, and thus the model selection capability will weaken as $D_{c}$
increases. However, FIC overestimates the data likelihood. As a result, FIC may
be overly biased towards models with less components. We propose a natural
generalization of FIC, which finds a middle ground between CRP and FIC, and may
yield more accurate model selection results than FIC.

by Robertson et al. (2015, ApJ 805L, 22R) arguing evidence of a rotation period
(143 days) at three times the orbital period of one of the proposed planets
(Kapteyn's b, P=48.6 days), and the existence of strong linear correlations
between its Doppler signal and activity data. By re-analyzing the data using
global optimization methods and model comparison, we show that such claim is
incorrect given that; 1) the choice of a rotation period at 143 days is
unjustified, and 2) the presence of linear correlations is not supported by the
data. We conclude that the radial velocity signals of Kapteyn's star remain
more simply explained by the presence of two super-Earth candidates orbiting
it. We also advocate for the use of global optimization procedures and
objective arguments, instead of claims lacking of a minimal statistical
support.

Compared with existing approaches that emphasize temporal consistency of each

mesh to join them in image space. The problem of extracting long-range motion
trajectories is changed to the issue of consistency of mesh evolution over

adaptive motion estimation method is proposed to initialize mesh between
successive frames. Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm to
efficiently adjust vertices of mesh for a physically plausible deformation,
which can meet the local rigidity of mesh and silhouette constraints. Finally,
we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods on a set of

favorable performance in terms of both accuracy and integrity of extracted

sometimes below all of them. This problem and the solution for it are well
known within the statistics community, but, apparently, not well known among
some of the physics community. The purpose of this note is didactic, to explain
the cause of the problem and the easy and elegant solution. The solution is to
use maximum likelihood instead of chi-square. The essential difference between
the two approaches is that maximum likelihood uses the normalization of each
term in the chi-square assuming it is a normal distribution, 1/sqrt(2 pi
sigma-square). In addition, the normalization is applied to the theoretical
expectation not to the data. In the present note we illustrate what goes wrong
and how maximum likelihood fixes the problem in a very simple toy example which
illustrates the problem clearly and is the appropriate physics model for event

different transport mechanisms during redistribution is investigated focusing
on the cases of convective transport with no-slip at the substrate, transport
via diffusion in the film bulk and via diffusion at the film surface. In

the framework of the recently proposed effective-energy approach which, under
the proper scaling of the collision energy, combines the constituent quark
picture with Landau relativistic hydrodynamics counting for the
centrality-defined effective energy of participants and relating different
types of collisions. Within this approach, the multiplicity energy dependence

By means of this scaling, called the energy balanced limiting fragmentation
scaling, one reproduces the pseudorapidity spectra for all centralities. The
scaling elucidates some differences in the multiplicity and midrapidity density
centrality dependence obtained at RHIC and LHC. These findings reveal an
inherent similarity in the multiplicity energy dependence from the most central
collisions and centrality data. A new regime in heavy-ion collisions to occur
at about a TeV energy is indicated, similar to that observed in the earlier

modes. We consider a high-energy parton which flies across such an unstable
plasma, and the energy transfer between the parton and the medium is studied as
an initial value problem. In the case of equilibrium plasmas, the well-known
formula of collisional energy loss is reproduced. The unstable plasma case is
much more complex, and the parton can lose or gain energy depending on the
initial conditions. The extremely prolate and extremely oblate systems are
considered as examples of unstable plasmas, and two classes of initial
conditions are discussed. When the initial chromodynamic field is uncorrelated
with the color state of the parton, it typically looses energy, and the
magnitude of the energy loss is comparable to that in an equilibrium plasma of
the same density. When the initial chromodynamic field is induced by the
parton, it can be either accelerated or decelerated depending on the relative
phase factor. With a correlated initial condition, the energy transfer grows
exponentially in time and its magnitude can much exceed the absolute value of
energy loss in an equilibrium plasma. The energy transfer is also strongly
directionally dependent. Consequences of our findings for the phenomenology of
jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are briefly discussed.

rotation, we then apply Sklyanin's separation of variables (SoV) and obtain a

integrand is expressed in terms of the so-called Baxter polynomials, which is
closely related to the quantum spectral curve approach. Along the way, we also

comprises of two condensates loaded in an optical lattice, which, in return, is
confined within a high-Q optical resonator. The system is driven by an external
laser that illuminates the atoms such that photons can scatter into the cavity.
In the superradiant phase a cavity field is established and we show that the
emerging cavity mediated interactions between the two condensates is capable of
entangling them despite photon losses. This macroscopic atomic entanglement is
sustained throughout the time-evolution apart from occasions of sudden
deaths/births. Using an auxiliary photon mode and coupling it to a collective

squeezing is proportional to the atomic entanglement and as such it can serve
as a probe field of the macroscopic entanglement.

approximately with the area. The results are compared with conventional Glauber

easily studied in the ratios between the total, inelastic and (quasi-)elastic

more closely proportional to A, and we see here that future electron-ion

transition rates by tailoring the electromagnetic field of an external coherent
light source is presented. The formalism considers both the center of mass and
internal degrees of freedom of the atom, and all properties of the field:
frequency, angular spectrum, and polarization. General features of recoil
effects for internal forbidden transitions are discussed. A comparative
analysis of different structured light sources is explicitly worked out. It
includes spherical waves, Gaussian beams, Laguerre-Gaussian beams, and
propagation invariant beams with closed analytical expressions. It is shown
that increments in the order of magnitude of the transition rates for Gaussian
and Laguerre-Gaussian beams, with respect to those obtained in the paraxial
limit, requires waists of the order of the wavelength, while propagation
invariant modes may considerably enhance transition rates under more favorable
conditions. For transitions that can be naturally described as modifications of
the atomic angular momentum, this enhancement is maximal (within propagation
invariant beams) for Bessel modes, Mathieu modes can be used to entangle the
internal and center of mass involved states, and Weber beams suppress this kind
of transitions unless they have a significant component of odd modes. However,
if a recoil effect of the transition with an adequate symmetry is allowed, the
global transition rate (center of mass and internal motion) can also be
enhanced using Weber modes. The global analysis presented reinforces the idea
that a better control of the transitions between internal atomic states
requires both a proper control of the available states of the atomic center of
mass, and shaping of the background electromagnetic field.

provide the observational signatures of transverse MHD waves in prominence

between resonant absorption and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) takes
place in which the KHI extracts the energy from the resonant layer and
dissipates it through vortices and current sheets, which rapidly degenerate
into turbulence. An inward enlargement of the boundary is produced in which the
turbulent flows conserve the characteristic dynamics from the resonance,
therefore guaranteeing detectability of the resonance imprints. We show that

suffer the short-boundary bias problem, which are tackled primarily through the
incorporation of long-range nodal interactions. However, the issue of
computational tractability becomes a significant issue when incorporating such
long-range nodal interactions, particularly when a large number of long-range

tractability when using fully-connected random fields by stochastically forming
a sparse representation of the random field. The proposed framework allows for
efficient structured inference using fully-connected random fields without any

us to unveil that these distinct types of interaction produce networks with
different statistical properties, in particular concerning the degree

configurations are unstable to precession to large misalignment when the binary
separation $r$ is between the values $r_{\rm ud\pm}= (\sqrt{\chi_1} \pm \sqrt{q
\chi_2})^4 (1-q)^{-2} M$, where $M$ is the total mass, $q \equiv m_2/m_1$ is
the mass ratio, and $\chi_1$ ($\chi_2$) is the dimensionless spin of the more
(less) massive black hole. This instability exists for a wide range of spin
magnitudes and mass ratios and can occur in the strong-field regime near
merger. We describe the origin and nature of the instability using recently
developed analytical techniques to characterize fully generic spin precession.
This instability provides a channel to circumvent astrophysical spin alignment
at large binary separations, allowing significant spin precession prior to
merger affecting both gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signatures of
stellar-mass and supermassive binary black holes.

segmentation enables one to represent a video by decomposing it into coherent

based on unsupervised learning due to expensive cost of pixelwise video
annotation and intra-class variability within similar unconstrained video
classes. We propose a Markov Random Field model for unconstrained video

defined from contour based superpixels, unary potentials from temporal smooth

Multi-cue structure is a breakthrough to extracting coherent object regions for

\citep{goldreich1969}, we consider the magnetosphere be stationary in space,
instead of corotating, and the electric field be uploaded from the potential
distribution on the pulsar surface, set up by the unipolar induction.
Consequently, the plasma of the magnetosphere undergoes guiding center drifts
of the gyro motion due to the transverse forces to the magnetic field. These
forces are the electric force, magnetic gradient force, and field line
curvature force. Since these plasma velocities are of drift nature, there is no
need to introduce an emf along the field lines, which would contradict the
$E_{\parallel}=\vec E\cdot\vec B=0$ plasma condition. Furthermore, there is
also no need to introduce the critical field line separating the electron and
ion open field lines. We present a self-consistent description where the
magnetosphere is described in terms of electric and magnetic fields and also in
terms of plasma velocities. The fields and velocities are then connected
through the space charge densities self-consistently. We solve the pulsar
equation analytically for the fields and construct the standard steady state
pulsar magnetosphere. By considering the unipolar induction inside the pulsar
and the magnetosphere outside the pulsar as one coupled system, and under the
condition that the unipolar pumping rate exceeds the Poynting flux in the open
field lines, plasma pressure can build up in the magnetosphere, in particular
in the closed region. This could cause a periodic openning up of the closed
region, leading to a pulsating magnetosphere, which could be an alternative for
pulsar beacons. The closed region can also be openned periodically by the
build-up of toroidal magnetic field through a positive feedback cycle.

we suggest using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM, Kohonen algorithm) with specific
structure based on planar graphs, with disconnected components (called D-SOM),

corresponding stationary distributions. As a matter of fact, we find clear
evidence of heterogeneous parts, each one with high homo-geneity, representing
situations well identified in terms of activity and wage levels and in degree
of stability in the workplace. These results and their interpretation in
economic terms contribute to the debate about flexibility which is commonly
seen as a way to obtain a better level of equilibrium on the labor market.

gradually shifting toward the cloud environments to obtain appropriate, robust
and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges (Sharma et al. 2014,
2015a, 2015b). Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly
scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the
expensive hardware and software also. In this paper, we study the evolution of
as-a-Service modalities, stimulated by cloud computing, and explore the most
complete inventory of new members beyond traditional cloud computing stack.

administrations, as these buildings are well known to consume a large amount of
energy. Since they are composite, complex systems, solutions to such a problem
can be approached from many different areas, from managerial to technological
to more strictly physical.
  In this paper we consider heat transfer processes in an ice hockey hall,
during operating conditions, with a bottom-up approach based upon on-site
measurements. Detailed heat flux, relative humidity and temperature data for
the ice pad and the indoor air are used for a heat balance calculation in the
steady-state regime, which quantifies the impact of each single heat source. We
then solve the heat conduction equation for the ice pad in transient regime,
and obtain a generic analytical formula for the temperature profile that can be
used in practical applications.
  We then apply this formula to the resurfacing process for validation, and
find good agreement with an analogous numerical solution. Since it is given
with implicit initial condition and boundary conditions, it can be used not
only in ice hockey halls, but in a large variety of engineering applications.

thousands of light years. Thus any change at the galactic center will be
noticed at the rim only tens of thousands of years later. Those retardation
effects seems to be neglected in present day galactic modelling used to
calculate rotational velocities of matter in the rims of the galaxy and
surrounding gas. The significant differences between the predictions of
Newtonian instantaneous action at a distance and observed velocities are
usually explained by either assuming dark matter or by modifying the laws of
gravity (MOND). In this paper we will show that taking general relativity
seriously without neglecting retardation effects one can explain the radial
velocities of galactic matter without postulating dark matter.

independent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing
information. In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in
a tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations
between tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has
some built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some
more general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge
of this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and
similarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent
individuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The
results from out method showed substantial differences between the lower part
of the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of
the hierarchies.
