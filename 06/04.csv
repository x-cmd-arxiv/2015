augmented with a logical theory. In this approach query answering proceeds
through a reformulation of a given query into a new one which can be answered
without any use of theory. Thus the problem reduces to the standard database
setting.
  However, the size of the query may increase substantially during the
reformulation. In this survey we review a recently developed framework on
proving lower and upper bounds on the size of this reformulation by employing

commonly assumed that moisture or oxygen in the environment causes the poor

into CH3NH3I + PbI2, i.e., the disproportionation is exothermic, independent of
the humidity or oxygen in the atmosphere. When the structure is distorted to
the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, the energetic cost of separation
increases, but remains small. Contributions from vibrational and
configurational entropy at room temperature have been considered, but the
instability of CH3NH3PbI3 is unchanged. When I is replaced by Br or Cl, Pb by
Sn, or the organic cation CH3NH3 by inorganic Cs, the perovskites become more
stable and do not phase-separate spontaneously. Our study highlights that the
poor chemical stability is intrinsic to CH3NH3PbI3 and suggests that

F/TI bilayers of finite length, sandwiched between two normal metal leads, will
generate a large antidamping-like SOT per very low charge current injected
parallel to the interface. The large values of antidamping-like SOT are {\it
spatially localized} around the transverse edges of the F overlayer. Our
analysis is based on adiabatic expansion (to first order in $\partial
\vec{m}/\partial t$) of time-dependent nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGFs),
describing electrons pushed out of equilibrium both by the applied bias voltage
and by the slow variation of a classical degree of freedom [such as
$\vec{m}(t)$]. From it we extract formulas for spin torque and charge pumping,
which show that they are reciprocal effects to each other, as well as Gilbert
damping in the presence of SO coupling. The NEGF-based formula for SOT
naturally splits into four components, determined by their behavior (even or
odd) under the time and bias voltage reversal. Their complex angular dependence
is delineated and employed within Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations of
magnetization dynamics in order to demonstrate capability of the predicted SOT
to efficiently switch $\vec{m}$ of a perpendicularly magnetized F overlayer.

fluxtubes with different initial configurations. In all considered cases,
energy release is triggered by the ideal kink instability, which is itself the
result of applying footpoint rotation to an initially potential field. The main
goal of this work is to establish the influence of the field topology and
various thermodynamic effects on the energy release process. Specifically, we
investigate convergence of the magnetic field at the loop footpoints,
atmospheric stratification, as well as thermal conduction. In all cases, the
application of vortical driving at the footpoints of an initally potential
field leads to an internal kink instability. With the exception of the curved
loop with high footpoint convergence, the global geometry of the loop change
little during the simulation. Footpoint convergence, curvature and atmospheric
structure clearly influences the rapidity with which a loop achieves
instability as well as the size of the subsequent energy release. Footpoint
convergence has a stabilising influence and thus the loop requires more energy
for instability, which means that the subsequent relaxation has a larger
heating effect. Large-scale curvature has the opposite result: less energy is
needed for instability and so the amount of energy released from the field is
reduced. Introducing a stratified atmosphere gives rise to decaying wave
phenomena during the driving phase, and also results in a loop that is less
stable.

errors in the experimental data. Recently, an optimal tomography [Phys. Rev. A
90, 062123 (2014)] has been proposed theoretically to measure one-by-one all
the elements of $\rho$. Thus, the relative errors in the reconstructed state
can be the same as those in the experimental data. We implemented this method
for two-qubit polarization states performing both local and global
measurements. For comparison, we also experimentally implemented other
well-known tomographic protocols based solely on local measurements (of, e.g.,
the Pauli operators and James-Kwiat-Munro-White projectors) and those with
mutually unbiased bases requiring both local and global measurements. We
reconstructed seventeen of two-qubit polarization states including separable,
partially and maximally entangled. Our experiments show the highest stability
against errors of our method in comparison to the other quantum tomographies.
In particular, we demonstrate that each optimally-reconstructed state} is
embedded in the uncertainty circle of the smallest radius, both in terms of the
trace distance and disturbance. We explain how to estimate experimentally the
uncertainty radii for all the implemented tomographies and show that, for each
reconstructed state, the relevant uncertainty circles intersect indicating the
approximate location of the corresponding physical density matrix.

numerical algorithm, for simulating incompressible flows with outflow/open
boundaries. This open boundary condition ensures the energy stability of the
system, even when strong vortices or backflows occur at the outflow boundary.
Under certain situations it can be reduced to a form that can be analogized to
the usual convective boundary condition. One prominent feature of this boundary
condition is that it provides a control over the velocity on the outflow/open
boundary. This is not available with the other energy-stable open boundary
conditions from previous works. Our numerical algorithm treats the proposed
open boundary condition based on a rotational velocity-correction type
strategy. It gives rise to a Robin-type condition for the discrete pressure and
a Robin-type condition for the discrete velocity on the outflow/open boundary,
respectively at the pressure and the velocity sub-steps. We present extensive
numerical experiments on a canonical wake flow and a jet flow in open domain to
test the effectiveness and performance of the method developed herein.
Simulation results are compared with the experimental data as well as with
other previous simulations to demonstrate the accuracy of the current method.
Long-time simulations are performed for a range of Reynolds numbers, at which
strong vortices and backflows occur at the outflow/open boundaries. The results
show that our method is effective in overcoming the backflow instability, and
that it allows for the vortices to discharge from the domain in a fairly
natural fashion even at high Reynolds numbers.

of frequency standards. Beside its metrological interest, it is also an
estimator of the large trends of the power spectral density (PSD) of frequency
deviation. For instance, the Allan variance is able to discriminate different
types of noise characterized by different power laws in the PSD. But, it was
also used in other fields: accelerometry, geophysics, geodesy, astrophysics and
even finances! However, it seems that up to now, it has been exclusively
applied for time series analysis. We propose here to use the Allan variance
onto spatial data.
  Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is used in geophysics to
image ground displacements in space (over the SAR image spatial coverage) and
in time thank to the regular SAR image acquisitions by dedicated satellites.
The main limitation of the technique is the atmospheric disturbances that
affect the radar signal while traveling from the sensor to the ground and back.
In this paper, we propose to use the Allan variance for analyzing spatial data
from InSAR measurements. The Allan variance was computed in XY mode as well as
in radial mode for detecting different types of behavior for different
space-scales, in the same way as the different types of noise versus the
integration time in the classical time and frequency application. We found that
radial AVAR is the more appropriate way to have an estimator insensitive to the
spatial axis and we applied it on SAR data acquired over eastern Turkey for the
period 2003-2011. Space AVAR allowed to well characterize noise features,
classically found in InSAR such as phase decorrelation producing white noise or
atmospheric delays, behaving like a random walk signal. We finally applied the
space AVAR to an InSAR time series to detect when the geophysical signal, here
the ground motion, emerges from the noise.

the existing coverage of these fields from the Spitzer Extended Deep Survey

paper, we propose an unsupervised feature selection method seeking a feature
coefficient matrix to select the most distinctive features. Specifically, our
proposed algorithm integrates the Maximum Margin Criterion with a
sparsity-based model into a joint framework, where the class margin and feature
correlation are taken into account at the same time. To maximize the total data
separability while preserving minimized within-class scatter simultaneously, we
propose to embed Kmeans into the framework generating pseudo class label
information in a scenario of unsupervised feature selection. Meanwhile, a
sparsity-based model, ` 2 ,p-norm, is imposed to the regularization term to
effectively discover the sparse structures of the feature coefficient matrix.
In this way, noisy and irrelevant features are removed by ruling out those
features whose corresponding coefficients are zeros. To alleviate the local
optimum problem that is caused by random initializations of K-means, a
convergence guaranteed algorithm with an updating strategy for the clustering
indicator matrix, is proposed to iteractively chase the optimal solution.
Performance evaluation is extensively conducted over six benchmark data sets.
From plenty of experimental results, it is demonstrated that our method has

However, despite the intense research that is carried out in GSs, so far there

Here, we report the dependence of TG as a function of the angle of the incident

that the angular dependence of the TG is intricate, since for moderated angles
the dependence is parabolic, while for large angles an exponential dependence

physics. One idea, known as state-dependence, is that quantum mechanics must be
generalized to describe the physics of black holes, and that fixed linear
operators do not provide the fundamental description of experiences for
infalling observers. Instead, such experiences are to be described by operators
with an extra dependence on the global quantum state. We show that any
implementation of this idea strong enough to remove firewalls from generic
states requires massive violations of the Born rule. We also demonstrate a
sense in which such violations are visible to infalling observers involved in
preparing the initial state of the black hole. We emphasize the generality of
our results; no details of any specific proposal for state-dependence are
required.

remains asymptotically near optimal. By contrast, the standard CUSUM method,
which does not account for the covariance structure, is shown to be
asymptotically optimal only in the increasing domain. Our algorithms and

calculations of quantum chromodynamics observables are adapted to expansions in
effective field theory (EFT). In the Bayesian approach, such truncation errors
are derived from degree-of-belief (DOB) intervals for EFT predictions.
Computation of these intervals requires specification of prior probability
distributions (""priors"") for the expansion coefficients. By encoding
expectations about the naturalness of these coefficients, this framework
provides a statistical interpretation of the standard EFT procedure where
truncation errors are estimated using the order-by-order convergence of the
expansion. It also permits exploration of the ways in which such error bars
are, and are not, sensitive to assumptions about EFT-coefficient naturalness.
We first demonstrate the calculation of Bayesian probability distributions for
the EFT truncation error in some representative examples, and then focus on the
application of chiral EFT to neutron-proton scattering. Epelbaum, Krebs, and
Mei{\ss}ner recently articulated explicit rules for estimating truncation
errors in such EFT calculations of few-nucleon-system properties. We find that
their basic procedure emerges generically from one class of naturalness priors
considered, and that all such priors result in consistent quantitative
predictions for 68% DOB intervals. We then explore several methods by which the
convergence properties of the EFT for a set of observables may be used to check
the statistical consistency of the EFT expansion parameter.

epochs and 21 McDonald observatory 2.7m telescope echelle spectra with 6 - 20
yr between epochs, over a range of scales from 0 - 360 au. The interstellar

any residuals due to changes in the foreground ISM. Of the 104 sightlines
investigated with typically five or more components in Na I D, possible
temporal variation was identified in five UVES spectra (six components), in Ca
II, Ca I and/or Na I absorption-lines. The variations detected range from 7\%

limits to changes of the order 0.1 - 0.3 dex in Ca II and Na I. These

at the resolution available in this study, is not very common at visible
wavelengths. A determination of the electron densities and lower limits to the

well-defined objective function, e.g., the channel capacity and the cut-off
rate. We propose easy-to-implement solutions for Gaussian channels that
approximate the optimal results for these maximization problems. Three topics
are addressed. First, we consider the case where the channel output is
quantized, and we find the quantization thresholds that maximize the mutual
information. The approximation derived from the asymptotic solution has a
negligible loss on the entire range of SNR when 2-PAM modulation is used, and
its quantization thresholds linearly depend on the standard deviation of noise.
We also derive a simple estimator of the relative capacity loss due to
quantization, based on the high-rate limit. Then we consider the integer
constraint on the decoding metric, and maximize the mismatched channel
capacity. We study the asymptotic solution of the optimal metric assignment and
show that the same approximation we derived in the matched decoding case still
holds for the mismatched decoder. Finally, we consider the demodulation problem
for 8PSK bit-interleaved coded modulation(BICM). We derive the approximated
optimal demodulation metrics that maximize the general cut-off rate or the
mismatched capacity using max-log approximation . The error rate performances
of the two metrics' assignments are compared, based on
Reed-Solomon-Viterbi(RSV) code, and the mismatched capacity metric turns out to
be better. The proposed approximation can be computed using an efficient
firmware algorithm, and improves the system performance of commercial chips.

  of k Gaussians, for any Constant k",,,,,"cs.DS cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, learning theory, and statistics. One notion of learning a GMM is
proper learning: here, the goal is to find a mixture of $k$ Gaussians
$\mathcal{M}$ that is close to the density $f$ of the unknown distribution from
which we draw samples. The distance between $\mathcal{M}$ and $f$ is typically
measured in the total variation or $L_1$-norm.
  We give an algorithm for learning a mixture of $k$ univariate Gaussians that
is nearly optimal for any fixed $k$. The sample complexity of our algorithm is
$\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$ and the running time is $(k \cdot
\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{O(k^4)} + \tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$. It is
well-known that this sample complexity is optimal (up to logarithmic factors),
and it was already achieved by prior work. However, the best known time
complexity for proper learning a $k$-GMM was
$\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{3k-1}})$. In particular, the dependence between
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ and $k$ was exponential. We significantly improve this
dependence by replacing the $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ term with a $\log
\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ while only increasing the exponent moderately. Hence, for
any fixed $k$, the $\tilde{O} (\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$ term dominates our
running time, and thus our algorithm runs in time which is nearly-linear in the
number of samples drawn. Achieving a running time of $\textrm{poly}(k,
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for proper learning of $k$-GMMs has recently been stated
as an open problem by multiple researchers, and we make progress on this
question.
  Moreover, our approach offers an agnostic learning guarantee: our algorithm
returns a good GMM even if the distribution we are sampling from is not a
mixture of Gaussians. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first
agnostic proper learning algorithm for GMMs.

galaxies at 3.4<z<4.2, selected from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey
(ZFOURGE), by fitting single Sersic profiles to HST/WFC3/F160W images from the
Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS).
Massive quiescent galaxies are very compact, with a median circularized
half-light radius r_e = 0.63 +/- 0.18 kpc. Removing 5/16 (31%) sources with
signs of AGN activity does not change the result. Star-forming galaxies have
r_e = 2.0 +/- 0.60 kpc, 3.2 +/- 1.3 x larger than quiescent galaxies. Quiescent
galaxies at z~4 are on average 6.0 +\- 0.17 x smaller than at z~0 and 1.9 +/-
0.7 x smaller than at z~2. Star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass are
2.4 +/- 0.7 x smaller than at z~0. Overall, the size evolution at 0<z<4 is well
described by a powerlaw, with r_e = 5.08 +/- 0.28 (1+z)^(-1.44+/-0.08) kpc for
quiescent and r_e = 6.02 +/- 0.28 (1+z)^(-0.72+/-0.05) kpc for star-forming
galaxies. Compact star-forming galaxies are rare in our sample: we find only
1/14 (7%) with r_e / (M / 10^11 M_Sun)^0.75 < 1.5, whereas 13/16 (81%) of the
quiescent galaxies is compact. The number density of compact quiescent galaxies
at z~4 is 1.8 +/- 0.8 x 10^-5 Mpc^-3 and increases rapidly, by >5 x, between
2<z<4. The paucity of compact star-forming galaxies at z~4 and their large
rest-frame ultra-violet median sizes suggest that the formation phase of
compact cores is very short and/or highly dust obscured.

339-4 taken during a failed outburst in summer 2013. These observations cover
Eddington luminosity fractions in the range ~0.9-6%. Throughout this outburst,
GX 339-4 stayed in the hard state, and all five observations show similar X-ray
spectra with a hard power-law with a photon index near 1.6 and significant
contribution from reflection. Using simple reflection models we find
unrealistically high iron abundances. Allowing for different photon indices for
the continuum incident on the reflector relative to the underlying observed
continuum results in a statistically better fit and reduced iron abundances.
With a photon index around 1.3, the input power-law on the reflector is
significantly harder than that which is directly observed. We study the
influence of different emissivity profiles and geometries and consistently find
an improvement when using separate photon indices. The inferred inner accretion
disk radius is strongly model dependent, but we do not find evidence for a
truncation radius larger than 100 r_g in any model. The data do not allow
independent spin constraints but the results are consistent with the literature
(i.e., a>0). Our best-fit models indicate an inclination angle in the range
40-60 degrees, consistent with limits on the orbital inclination but higher
than reported in the literature using standard reflection models. The iron line
around 6.4 keV is clearly broadened, and we detect a superimposed narrow core
as well. This core originates from a fluorescence region outside the influence
of the strong gravity of the black hole and we discuss possible geometries.

of a first order mean motion reso- nance while simultaneously undergoing
eccentricity damping and convergent migration. Following Goldreich &
Schlichting (2014), we include a coupling between the dissipative semimajor
axis evolution and the damping of the eccentricities. In agreement with past
studies, we find that this coupling can lead to overstability of the resonance
and that for a certain range of parameters capture into resonance is only
temporary. Using a more general model, we show that whether overstable motion
can occur depends in a characteristic way on the mass ratio between the two
planets as well as their relative eccentricity damping timescales. Moreover, we
show that even when escape from resonance does occur, the timescale for escape
is long enough such at any given time a pair of planets is more likely to be
found in a resonance rather than migrating between them. Thus, we argue that
overstability of resonances cannot singlehandedly reconcile convergent
migration with the observed lack of Kepler planet pairs found near resonances.
However, it is possible that overstable motion in combination with other
effects such as large scale orbital instability could produce the observed
period ratio distribution.

fulfill a Mandelstam double-dispersive representation; and the explicit

density that can be achieved in collision of $N$ slowly moving kinks and
antikinks in the integrable sine-Gordon field, remarkably, is proportional to
$N^2$, while the total energy of the system is proportional to $N$. This
maximal energy density can be achieved only if the difference between the
number of colliding kinks and antikinks is minimal, i.e., is equal to 0 for
even $N$ and 1 for odd $N$ and if the pattern involves an alternating array of
kinks and anti-kinks. Interestingly, for odd (even) $N$ the maximal energy
density appears in the form of potential (kinetic) energy, while kinetic
(potential) energy is equal to zero. The results of the present study rely on
the analysis of the exact multi-soliton solutions for $N=1,2,$ and 3 and on the

can speculate that the soliton collisions in the sine-Gordon field can, in

obtain a non-vanishing cross-correlation, previous studies have required the
presence of an additional global charging energy. Adding nonlocal terms in the

stars at the zero-age MS, consistent with measurements from active eclipsing

causing isochrone-derived masses to be under-estimated by up to a factor of $2
\times$, and ages to be under-estimated by a factor of 2-10$\times$, at 3 Myr.
Consequently, pre-MS clusters and their active stars are systematically older

depletion boundary technique are erroneously young by $\sim 15$% and $10$% at
$30$ and $100$ Myr respectively, if 50% spotted stars are interpreted with
un-spotted models. Finally, lithium depletion is suppressed in spotted stars
with radiative cores, leading to a fixed-temperature lithium dispersion on the
MS if a range of spot properties are present on the pre-MS. Such dispersions
are large enough to explain Li abundance spreads seen in young open clusters,
and imply a range of radii at fixed mass and age during the pre-MS Li burning

clearly shows the main sequence extending towards the expected end of the
Hydrogen-burning limit and going beyond this point towards fainter sources. The
white dwarf sequence can be identified. As such, this is the deepest NIR CMD of
a globular cluster to date. Archival HST optical data were used for
proper-motion cleaning of the CMD and for distinguishing the white dwarfs (WDs)
from brown dwarf (BD) candidates. Detection limits in the NIR are around F110W
approx 26.5 mag and F160W approx27 mag, and in the optical around F775W approx
28 mag. Comparing our observed CMDs with theoretical models, we conclude that
we have reached beyond the H-burning limit in our NIR CMD and are probably just
above or around this limit in our optical-NIR CMDs. Thus, any faint NIR sources
that have no optical counterpart are potential BD candidates, since the optical
data are not deep enough to detect them. We visually inspected the positions of
NIR sources which are fainter than the H-burning limit in F110W and for which
the optical photometry did not return a counterpart. We found in total five
sources for which we did not get an optical measurement. For four of these five
sources, a faint optical counterpart could be visually identified, and an upper
optical magnitude was estimated. Based on these upper optical magnitude limits,
we conclude that one source is likely a WD, one source could either be a WD or
BD candidate, and the remaining two sources agree with being BD candidates. For
only one source no optical counterpart could be detected, which makes this
source a good BD candidate. We conclude that we found in total four good BD
candidates.

based on packing of spheres, which are (Euclidean) variants of the Packed Swiss
Cheese Cosmology models. As the action functional for gravity we consider the
spectral action of noncommutative geometry, and we compute its expansion on a
space obtained as an Apollonian packing of 3-dimensional spheres inside a
4-dimensional ball. Using information from the zeta function of the Dirac
operator of the spectral triple, we compute the leading terms in the asymptotic
expansion of the spectral action. They consist of a zeta regularization of a
divergent sum which involves the leading terms of the spectral actions of the
individual spheres in the packing. This accounts for the contribution of the
points 1 and 3 in the dimension spectrum (as in the case of a 3-sphere). There
is an additional term coming from the residue at the additional point in the
real dimension spectrum that corresponds to the packing constant, as well as a
series of fluctuations coming from log-periodic oscillations, created by the
points of the dimension spectrum that are off the real line. These terms detect
the fractality of the residue set of the sphere packing. We show that the
presence of fractality influences the shape of the slow-roll potential for
inflation, obtained from the spectral action. We also discuss the effect of
truncating the fractal structure at a certain scale related to the energy scale
in the spectral action.

to appraise the pros and cons of a possibility that this object is --- despite
its brightness reported at discovery --- a dwarf Kreutz sungrazer. We confirm
Marsden's (1989) conclusion that C/1945 X1 has a common parent with C/1882 R1
and C/1965 S1, in line with the Sekanina-Chodas (2004) scenario of their origin
in the framework of the Kreutz system's evolution. We integrate the orbit of
C/1882 R1 back to the early 12th century and then forward to around 1945 to
determine the nominal direction of the line of apsides and perform a Fourier
analysis to get insight into effects of the indirect planetary perturbations.
To better understand the nature of C/1945 X1, its orbital motion, fate, and
role in the hierarchy of the Kreutz system as well as to attempt detecting the
comet's possible terminal outburst shortly after perihelion and answer the

Boyden Observatory logbooks and identified both the photographs with the
comet's known images and nearly 20 additional patrol plates, taken both before

searched for, once the process of their digitization, currently conducted as
part of the Harvard College Observatory's DASCH Project, has been completed and

bcc-hcp equilibrium coexistence pressure of 8.4 GPa, with the transition-state

coherent stress occurs at the transition state, which has a form of a cusp on
the potential-energy surface (yet all the atomic and cell degrees of freedom

critical role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in this honeycomb lattice system.
The low-temperature ferromagnetic phase displays a half-semimetallic Dirac
point pinning the Fermi level and preventing gap opening before consideration
of SOC, presenting a case in which correlation effects modeled by a repulsive
Hubbard $U$ fail to open a gap. Simultaneous inclusion of both correlation and
SOC drives a large orbital moment in excess of 0.7 $\mu_B$ (essentially $L$ =
1) for spin aligned along the $\hat{c}$ axis, with a gap comparable with the
inferred experimental value. The large orbital moment accounts for the large
Ising anisotropy, in spite of the small magnitude of the SOC strength on the
3$d$ (Fe) ion. Ultimately, the Mott-Hubbard gap is enabled by degeneracy
lifting by SOC and the large Fe moments, rather than by standard Hubbard
interactions alone. We suggest that competing orbital occupations are
responsible for the structural transitions involved in the observed re-entrant

While best practices and guidelines for constructing good formulations abound,

formulation paradigm for systematically constructing formulations for
disjunctive constraints that are optimal with respect to size. More
specifically, they yield the smallest possible ideal formulation (i.e. one

particles using a traditional histogram binning, including a probability
distribution function of collisional velocities. The fragmentation strength of
the particles depends on their composition (icy aggregates are stronger than
silicate aggregates). The particle opacity, which controls the nebula thermal
structure, evolves as particles grow and mass redistributes. While growing,
particles drift radially due to nebula headwind drag. Particles of different
compositions evaporate at ""evaporation fronts"" (EFs) where the midplane
temperature exceeds their respective evaporation temperatures. We track the
vapor and solid phases of each component, accounting for advection and radial
and vertical diffusion. We present characteristic results in evolutions lasting
$2 \times 10^5$ years. In general, (a) mass is transferred from the outer to
inner nebula in significant amounts, creating radial concentrations of solids
at EFs, (b) particle sizes are limited by a combination of fragmentation,
bouncing, and drift, (c) ""lucky"" large particles never represent a significant
amount of mass, and (d) restricted radial zones just outside each EF become
compositionally enriched in the associated volatiles. We point out implications

record data about process executions, which can be extracted as event logs.
Predictive process monitoring is concerned with exploiting such event logs to
predict how running (uncompleted) cases will unfold up to their completion. In
this paper, we propose a predictive process monitoring framework for estimating
the probability that a given predicate will be fulfilled upon completion of a
running case. The predicate can be, for example, a temporal logic constraint or
a time constraint, or any predicate that can be evaluated over a completed
trace. The framework takes into account both the sequence of events observed in
the current trace, as well as data attributes associated to these events. The
prediction problem is approached in two phases. First, prefixes of previous
traces are clustered according to control flow information. Secondly, a
classifier is built for each cluster using event data to discriminate between
fulfillments and violations. At runtime, a prediction is made on a running case
by mapping it to a cluster and applying the corresponding classifier. The
framework has been implemented in the ProM toolset and validated on a log
pertaining to the treatment of cancer patients in a large hospital.

$\left\| \cdot \right\|_{\psi,2}$ is shown to be a Haar measure-preserving
bijection from the subset of infinite graphs to the circle (with the
Haar/Lebesgue measure), thereby naturally identifying the two spaces. As a
consequence, we establish a ""change of variables"" formula that enables the
transfer of the Riemann-Lebesgue theory on $\mathbb{R}$ to graph space
$\mathscr{G}(V)$. This also complements previous work in which a theory of
Newton-Leibnitz differentiation was transferred from the real line to
$\mathscr{G}(V)$ for countable $V$. Finally, we identify the Pontryagin dual of
$\mathscr{G}(V)$, and characterize the positive definite functions on
$\mathscr{G}(V)$.

$\mathcal H=(\partial_j H_i(u_1,\cdots,u_m))_{i,j=1}^m$ is symmetric. The
notion of symmetric systems seems crucial to study this system with a general
nonlinearity $H=(H_i)_{i=1}^m$. We establish De Giorgi type results for stable
and $H$-monotone solutions of symmetric systems in lower dimensions that is
either $n=2$ and $0<s_i<1$ or $n=3$ and $1/2 \le \min\{s_i\}<1$. The case that
$n=3$ and at least one of parameters $s_i$ belongs to $(0,1/2)$ remains open as
well as the case $n \ge 4$. Applying a geometric Poincar\'{e} inequality, we
conclude that gradients of components of solutions are parallel in lower
dimensions when the system is coupled. More precisely, we show that the angle
between vectors $\nabla u_i$ and $\nabla u_j$ is exactly
$\arccos\left({|\partial_j H_i(u)|}/{\partial_j H_i(u)}\right)$. In addition,
we provide Hamiltonian identities, monotonicity formulae and Liouville

to investigate the strength of the crust-core coupling in a neutron star, and
suggest that recovery from the glitch is dominated by torque exerted by the
re-coupling of superfluid components of the core that were decoupled from the
crust during the glitch. Assuming that the recoupling is mediated by mutual
friction between the superfluid neutrons and the charged components of the
core, we use the observed magnitudes and timescales of the shortest timescale
components of the recoveries from two recent glitches in the Vela pulsar to
infer the fraction of the core that is coupled to the crust during the glitch,
and hence spun up by the glitch event. Within the framework of a two-fluid
hydrodynamic model of glitches, we analyze whether crustal neutrons alone are
sufficient to drive the glitch activity observed in the Vela pulsar. We use two
sets of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), both of which span crust and
core consistently and cover a range of the slope of the symmetry energy at
saturation density $30 < L <120$ MeV. One set produces maximum masses
$\approx$2.0$M_{\odot}$, the second $\approx$2.6$M_{\odot}$. We also include
the effects of entrainment of crustal neutrons by the superfluid lattice. We
find that for medium to stiff EOSs, observations imply $>70\%$ of the moment of
inertia of the core is coupled to the crust during the glitch, though for
softer EOSs $L\approx 30$MeV as little as $5\%$ could be coupled. No EOS is
able to reproduce the observed glitch activity with crust neutrons alone, but
extending the region where superfluid vortices are strongly pinned into the
core by densities as little as 0.016fm$^{-3}$ above the crust-core transition
density restores agreement with the observed glitch activity.

quark phase and in the 2-color superconductor (2SC) phase. For the normal
phase, the thermodynamic potential is calculated by using hard dense loop (HDL)
resummation to leading order, where the dominant contribution comes from the
longitudinal gluon rest mass. The effect of gluonic interaction to the symmetry
energy, obtained from the thermodynamic potential, was found to be small. In
the 2SC phase, the non-perturbative BCS paring gives enhanced symmetry energy
as the gapped states are forced to be in the common Fermi sea reducing the
number of available quarks that can contribute to the asymmetry. We used high
density effective field theory to estimate the contribution of gluon
interaction to the symmetry energy. Among the gluon rest masses in 2SC phase,
only the Meissner mass has iso-spin dependence although the magnitude is much
smaller than the Debye mass. As the iso-spin dependence of gluon rest masses is
even smaller than the case in the normal phase, we expect that the contribution
of gluonic interaction to the symmetry energy in the 2SC phase will be minimal.
The different value of symmetry energy in each phase will lead to different
prediction for the particle yields in heavy ion collision experiment.

disk galaxies have nontrivial dynamics. Of particular significance are: a) the
cored dark matter profile of disk galaxies, b) correlations of the shape of
rotation curves with baryonic properties, and c) Tully-Fisher relations. Dark
matter halos around disk galaxies may have nontrivial dynamics if dark matter
is strongly self interacting and dissipative. Multicomponent hidden sector dark
matter featuring a massless `dark photon' (from an unbroken dark $U(1)$ gauge
interaction) which kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon provides a
concrete example of such dark matter. The kinetic mixing interaction
facilitates halo heating by enabling ordinary supernovae to be a source of
these `dark photons'. Dark matter halos can expand and contract in response to
the heating and cooling processes, but for a sufficiently isolated halo could
have evolved to a steady state or `equilibrium' configuration where heating and
cooling rates locally balance. This dynamics allows the dark matter density
profile to be related to the distribution of ordinary supernovae in the disk of
a given galaxy. In a previous paper a simple and predictive formula was derived
encoding this relation. Here we improve on previous work by modelling the
supernovae distribution via the measured UV and $H\alpha$ fluxes, and compare
the resulting dark matter halo profiles with the rotation curve data for each
dwarf galaxy in the LITTLE THINGS sample. The dissipative dark matter concept
is further developed and some conclusions drawn.

Berezin quantization of compact K\""ahler manifolds. Our main tool is the notion
of subproduct systems of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which enables all
involved objects, such as the Toeplitz operators, to be very conveniently
expressed in terms of shift operators compressed to a subspace of full Fock
space. This subspace is not required to be contained in the symmetric Fock
space, so from finite-dimensional matrix algebras we can construct
noncommutative manifolds with extra structure generalizing that of a projective
variety endowed with a positive Hermitian line bundle and a canonical K\""ahler
metric in the class of the line bundle. Even in the commutative setting these
constructions are very fruitful. Firstly, we show that the algebra of smooth
functions on any smooth projective variety can be quantized in a strong sense
of inductive limits, as was previously only accomplished for homogeneous
manifolds. In this way the K\""ahler manifold is recovered exactly from
quantization and not just approximately. Secondly, we obtain a strict
quantization also for singular varieties. Thirdly, we show that the Arveson
conjecture is true in full generality for shift operators compressed to the
subspace of symmetric Fock space associated with any homogeneous ideal. For
noncommutative examples we consider homogeneous spaces for compact matrix
quantum groups which generalize $q$-deformed projective spaces, and we show

solely from the representation theory of the quantum group. We also discuss
interesting connections with noncommutative random walks.

systems, but are also of interest from an algebraic point of view. We propose a
definition of a linking system associated to a saturated fusion system which is
more general than the one currently in the literature and thus allows a more
flexible choice of objects of linking systems. More precisely, we define
subcentric subgroups of fusion systems in a way that every quasicentric
subgroup of a saturated fusion system is subcentric. Whereas the objects of
linking systems in the current definition are always quasicentric, the objects
of our linking systems only need to be subcentric. We prove that, associated to
each saturated fusion system $\mathcal{F}$, there is a unique linking system
whose objects are the subcentric subgroups of $\mathcal{F}$. Furthermore, the
nerve of such a subcentric linking system is homotopy equivalent to the nerve
of the centric linking system associated to $\mathcal{F}$. We believe that the
existence of subcentric linking systems opens a new way for a classification of
fusion systems of characteristic $p$-type. The various results we prove about
subcentric subgroups give furthermore some evidence that the concept is of
interest for studying extensions of linking systems and fusion systems.

producing super-horizon curvature perturbations in CMB. But large
non-gaussianity and iso-curvature perturbations produced by this mechanism rule
out its acceptability as the sole process responsible for generating CMB
perturbations. We explore the situation where CMB perturbations are mostly
generated by usual quantum fluctuations of inflaton during inflation, but a
modulated coupling constant between inflaton and a secondary scalar affects the
preheating process and produces some extra curvature perturbations. If the
modulating scalar field is considered to be a dark matter candidate, coupling
constant between the fields has to be unnaturally fine tuned in order to keep
the local-form non-gaussianity and the amplitude of iso-curvature perturbations
within observational limit; otherwise parameters of the models have to be
tightly constrained. Those constraints imply that the curvature perturbations
generated by modulated preheating should be less than 15% of the total observed
CMB perturbations. On the other hand if the modulating scalar field is not a
dark matter candidate, parameters of the models could not be constrained, but
the constraints on the maximum amount of the curvature perturbations coming
from modulated preheating remain valid.

this linear section is rational \cite{I}. In the case of the space quadric, the

rate, $W$, is studied in a complete phase diagram of a 2D superconductor above
the upper critical field line $H_{c2}(T)$ . In the region of relatively high
temperatures and low magnetic fields, the relaxation rate $W$ is determined by
two competing effects. The first one is its decrease in result of suppression
of quasi-particle density of states (DOS) due to formation of fluctuation
Cooper pairs (FCP). The second one is a specific, purely quantum, relaxation
process of the Maki-Thompson (MT) type, which for low field leads to an
increase of the relaxation rate. The latter describes particular fluctuation
processes involving self-pairing of a single electron on self-intersecting
trajectories of a size up to phase-breaking length $l_{\phi }$ which becomes
possible due to an electron spin-flip scattering event at a nucleus. As a
result, different scenarios with either growth or decrease of the NMR
relaxation rate are possible upon approaching the normal metal - type-II
superconductor transition. The character of fluctuations changes along the line
$H_{c2}$ from the thermal long-wavelength type in weak magnetic fields to the
clusters of rotating FCP in fields comparable to $H_{c2}$. We find that below
the well-defined temperature $T^*_0\approx 0.6T_{c0}$, the MT process becomes
ineffective even in absence of intrinsic pair-breaking. The small scale of FCP
rotations ($\xi_{xy}$) in so high fields impedes formation of long (<$l_{\phi
}$) self-intersecting trajectories, causing the corresponding relaxation
mechanism to lose its efficiency. This reduces the effect of superconducting
fluctuations in the domain of high fields and low temperatures to just the
suppression of quasi-particle DOS, analogously to the Abrikosov vortex phase
below the $H_{c2}$ line.

numerical simulations of tropical cyclone to cumulus physics parametrization is
carried out with a view to determine the best cumulus physics option for

by WRF ARW in a nested domain with NCEP Global Final Analysis(FNL) data as
initial and boundary conditions. The model domain consists of one parent domain
and one nested domain. The resolution of the parent domain is 36 km while the
nested domain has a resolution of 12 km. Five numerical simulations have been
done with the same micro-physics scheme (WSM3), planetary boundary layer

Four cumulus Parametrization schemes are KF, BMJ, GF and Tiedtke and one
simulation was done without any cumulus physics scheme. The results of model
simulations are compared with corresponding analysis or observation data. For
best result data provided by Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NASA tropical

found that tracks, intensity, wind speed, precipitation, and central pressure
of the cyclone have sensitive result with different cumulus physics schemes.

where the background space-time geometry plays a crucial role. I discuss two
types of backgrounds: (i) Lorentz Violating and (ii) Geometries with Torsion.
In the former case, the violation of Lorentz symmetry, at a scale M, may be
viewed as a catalyst for mass generation and induced flavour oscillations among
neutrino species, which survive the limit of M taken to infinity, leading to a
hierarchy among neutrino masses. In the latter case, the (totally antisymmetric
components of the) torsion degrees of freedom correspond to a pseudoscalar
axion field in four space-time dimensions. This field is assumed to be mixed,
through non-diagonal kinetic terms, with ordinary axion fields that may exist
in the theory for other reasons and couple to neutrinos with chirality changing
Yukawa couplings. The torsion-ordinary-axion-field mixing is responsible,
through higher-loop anomalous graphs, for the dynamical generation of Majorana
masses. The latter scenarios can also be realised in some (compactified) string
theory models, where the (totally antisymmetric) torsion is played by the field
strength of the spin-one antisymmetric tensor (Kalb-Ramond) field, which exists
in the gravitational string multiplet.

interpreted in terms of varying separation expected to follow the 1/D rule for

significant difference of separation between 2002 and 2014. This suggests the
colliding-wind region in the wide orbit does not contribute a lot to the total
X-ray emission, with a main contribution coming from the radiative shocked
winds in the eclipsing pair. The later result provides evidence that shocks in
a colliding-wind region may be efficient particle accelerators even in the
absence of bright X-ray emission, suggesting particle acceleration may operate
in a wide range of conditions. Finally, in hierarchical triple O-type systems,
thermal X-rays do not necessarily constitute an efficient tracer to detect the

lack of data as well as tool sharing by researchers. We conduct a survey of
authors of past three years of MSR conference (2012, 2013 and 2014) to collect
data on their views and suggestions to address the stated concerns. We asked 20
questions from more than 100 authors and received a response from 39 authors.
Our results shows that about one-third of the respondents always make their
dataset publicly available and about one-third believe that data sharing should
be a mandatory condition for publication in MSR conferences. Our survey reveals
that more than 50% authors used solely open-source software (OSS) dataset for
their research. More than 50% of the respondents mentioned that difficulty in
sharing Industrial dataset outside the company is one of the major impediments
in University-Industry collaboration.

of the multiplicity of these dust makers is pivotal to understand the dust

an X-ray emission attributable to colliding-winds in a binary system. The main
result of this analysis is the lack of detection of X-rays coming from WR106.
Upper limits on the X-ray flux are estimated, but the derived numbers are not
sufficient to provide compelling constraints on the existence or not of a

persistent dust makers have been poorly investigated by the most sensitive

large organization with over 1,000 individuals throughout four consecutive

unpredictable, the macro-evolution of social communication networks follows
well-defined statistical patterns, characterized by exponentially decaying
log-variations of the weight of social ties and of individuals' social
strength. At the same time, we find that individuals have social signatures and
communication strategies that are remarkably stable over the scale of several

cosmological time variation of the scalar field is not suppressed in both

angle, this spatially oscillating behavior matches the geometrical periodicity
of the opal, and hence the related density of resonant infiltration. Close to
these matching conditions, the resonant response of the global infiltration
varies sharply in amplitude and shape with the incidence angle and
polarization. The corresponding resonant reflection originates from a rather
deep infiltration, up to several wavelengths or layers of spheres. Finally, we

phase diagrams of the two-dimensional Kondo lattice model have been carefully
studied as functions of the Kondo coupling $J$ and the conduction electron
concentration $n_{c}$. In addition to the conventional hybridization between
local moments and itinerant electrons, a staggered hybridization is proposed to
characterize the interplay between the antiferromagnetism and the Kondo
screening effect. As a result, a heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase is
obtained and separated from the pure antiferromagnetic ordered phase by a
first-order Lifshitz phase transition, while a continuous phase transition
exists between the heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondo
paramagnetic phase. We have developed a efficient theory to calculate these
phase boundaries. As $n_{c}$ decreases from the half-filling, the region of the
heavy fermion antiferromagnetic phase shrinks and finally disappears at a
critical point $n_{c}^{*}=0.8228$, leaving a first-order critical line between
the pure antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondo paramagnetic phase for
$n_{c}<n_{c}^{* }$. At half-filling limit, a finite temperature phase diagram
is also determined on the Kondo coupling and temperature ($J$-$T$) plane.
Notably, as the temperature is increased, the region of the heavy fermion
antiferromagnetic phase is reduced continuously, and finally converges to a
single point, together with the pure antiferromagnetic phase and the Kondo
paramagnetic phase. The phase diagrams with such triple point may account for
the observed phase transitions in related heavy fermion materials.

gravitational wave searches using pulsar timing arrays. Gravitational wave
signals from such systems are well represented by parametrized models, allowing
the standard Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) to be used for their
detection and estimation. However, there is a dichotomy in how the GLRT can be
implemented for pulsar timing arrays: there are two possible ways in which one
can split the set of signal parameters for semi-analytical and numerical
extremization. The straightforward extension of the method used for continuous
signals in ground-based gravitational wave searches, where the so-called pulsar
phase parameters are maximized numerically, was addressed in an earlier paper
(Wang et al. 2014). In this paper, we report the first study of the performance
of the second approach where the pulsar phases are maximized semi-analytically.
This approach is scalable since the number of parameters left over for
numerical optimization does not depend on the size of the pulsar timing array.
Our results show that, for the same array size (9 pulsars), the new method
performs somewhat worse in parameter estimation, but not in detection, than the
previous method where the pulsar phases were maximized numerically. The origin
of the performance discrepancy is likely to be in the ill-posedness that is
intrinsic to any network analysis method. However, scalability of the new
method allows the ill-posedness to be mitigated by simply adding more pulsars
to the array. This is shown explicitly by taking a larger array of pulsars.

lightest supersymmetric neutralino mass around 1 TeV and 3 TeV, corresponding
to Higgsino-like and Wino-like neutralino, respectively. The kinetic decoupling
temperature in the MSSM-9 scenario leads to a most probable protohalo mass in a
range of $M_{\mathrm{ph}}\sim 10^{-12}-10^{-7}\,M_\odot$. The part of the
region closer to 2 TeV gives also important contributions from the
neutralino-stau co-annihilation, reducing the effective annihilation rate in
the early Universe. We also study how the size of the smallest DM substructures
correlates to experimental signatures, such as the spin-dependent and
spin-independent scattering cross sections, relevant for direct detection of
DM. Improvements on the spin-independent sensitivity might reduce the most

particular state-of-the-art communications systems since they provide the
practicality of error detections and corrections aligned with repeat-requests
when needed at receivers. The queueing characteristics of these systems have
taken considerable focus since the current technology demands data
transmissions with a minimum delay provisioning. In this paper, we investigate
the effects of physical layer characteristics on data link layer performance in
a general class of HARQ systems. Constructing a state transition model that
combines queue activity at a transmitter and decoding efficiency at a receiver,
we identify the probability of clearing the queue at the transmitter and the
packet-loss probability at the receiver. We determine the effective capacity
that yields the maximum feasible data arrival rate at the queue under
quality-of-service constraints. In addition, we put forward non-asymptotic
backlog and delay bounds. Finally, regarding three different HARQ protocols,
namely Type-I HARQ, HARQ-chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ-incremental
redundancy (HARQ-IR), we show the superiority of HARQ-IR in delay robustness
over the others. However, we further observe that the performance gap between
HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR is quite negligible in certain cases. The novelty of our

evolution of grain properties in the transition from the diffuse interstellar
medium (ISM) to denser molecular clouds. The differences in the dust spectral
energy distribution (SED) observed from the diffuse ISM to denser regions,
namely an increase in the spectral index at long wavelengths, an increase in
the FIR opacity, and a decrease in temperature, are usually assumed to be the
result of changes in dust properties. We investigate if evolutionary processes,
such as coagulation and accretion, are able to change the dust properties of
grains in a way that is consistent with observations. We use a core-mantle
grain model to describe diffuse ISM-type grains, and using DDA we calculate how
the accretion of mantles and coagulation into aggregates vary the grain optical
properties. We calculate the dust SED and extinction using DustEM and the
radiative transfer code CRT. We show that the accretion of an aliphatic carbon
mantle on diffuse ISM-type dust leads to an increase in the FIR opacity by a
factor of about 2 and in the FIR/submm spectral index from 1.5 to 1.8, and to a
decrease in the temperature by about 2 K. We also show that the coagulation of
these grains into aggregates further decreases the temperature by 3 K and
increases the spectral index up to a value of $\sim$2. The FIR opacity is
increased by a factor of 3 (7) for these aggregates (with an additional
ice-mantle) compared to the diffuse ISM-dust. Dust evolution in the ISM
resulting from coagulation and accretion, leads to significant changes in the
optical properties of the grains that can explain the observed variations in
the dust SED in the transition from the diffuse ISM to denser regions.

the local Coulomb repulsions which drive domain reorientation and the dominant
mechanism is dictated by the equilibrium Mn-O-Mn bond angle. Our results

halo with an angular extent of 2.6 arcmin, corresponding to 0.8 Mpc at the
cluster redshift, qualifying it as a GRH. J0256 is one of the lowest-mass
systems, $M_{\rm 500,SZ} = (5.0 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, found to host
a GRH. We measure the GRH at lower significance at 325 MHz ($S_{325} = 10.3 \pm

1.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$. This result is consistent with the mean spectral index of
the population of typical radio halos, $\alpha = 1.2 \pm 0.2$. Adopting the

a quantized topological number associated with it. In particular, the recent
discovery of three-dimensional Dirac semimetals in Na$_{3}$Bi and
Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ demonstrates that a Dirac point with four-fold degeneracy can
be stable as long as certain crystalline symmetries are supplemented in
addition to the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, the
topological charges associated with Na$_{3}$Bi and Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ are not
clarified yet. In this work, we identify the topological charge of
three-dimensional Dirac points. It is found that although the simultaneous
presence of the time-reversal and inversion symmetries forces the net chiral
charge to vanish, a Dirac point can carry another quantized topological charge
when an additional rotation symmetry is considered. Two different classes of
Dirac semimetals are identified depending on the nature of the rotation
symmetries. First, the conventional symmorphic rotational symmetry which
commutes with the inversion gives rise to the class I Dirac semimetals having a
pair of Dirac points on the rotation axes. Since the topological charges of
each pair of Dirac points have the opposite sign, a pair-creation or a
pair-annihilation is required to change the number of Dirac points in the
momentum space. On the other hand, the class II Dirac semimetals possess a
single isolated Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum, which is
protected by a screw rotation. The non-symmorphic nature of screw rotations
allows the anti-commutation relation between the rotation and inversion
symmetries, which enables to circumvent the doubling of the number of Dirac
points and create a single Dirac point at the Brillouin zone boundary.

developed which preserves the quality of the results offered by the

found that the cluster dissociates almost in one step to six free atoms when
the temperature is increased. Precursors of the dissociation are only
observable in the distances of the atoms via the appearance of a second isomer.
The process is almost classical. However, the method is able to resolve small
differences in the temperatures at which the dissociation takes place and in
the mean distances of the bound configuration.

rescaled perimeter by analyzing the impact of the wall on two complementary
parts of the convex hull. Finally, we provide a further quantification of the
convex hull by determining the mean length of the portion of the reflecting
wall visited by the Brownian motion as a function of the initial distance to

Although an ideal EoS with a constant \textit{adiabatic index} $\Gamma$ is the
preferred choice due to its simplistic implementation, many astrophysical fluid
simulations may benefit from a more sophisticated treatment that can account
for diverse chemical processes. Here, we first review the basic thermodynamic
principles of a gas mixture in terms of its thermal and caloric EoS by
including effects like ionization, dissociation as well as temperature
dependent degrees of freedom such as molecular vibrations and rotations. The
formulation is revisited in the context of plasmas that are either in
equilibrium conditions (local thermodynamic- or collisional excitation-
equilibria) or described by non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to optically thin
radiative cooling. We then present a numerical implementation of thermally
ideal gases obeying a more general caloric EoS with non-constant adiabatic
index in Godunov-type numerical schemes.We discuss the necessary modifications
to the Riemann solver and to the conversion between total energy and pressure
(or vice-versa) routinely invoked in Godunov-type schemes. We then present two
different approaches for computing the EoS.The first one employs root-finder
methods and it is best suited for EoS in analytical form. The second one leans
on lookup table and interpolation and results in a more computationally
efficient approach although care must be taken to ensure thermodynamic
consistency. A number of selected benchmarks demonstrate that the employment of
a non-ideal EoS can lead to important differences in the solution when the
temperature range is $500-10^4$ K where dissociation and ionization occur. The
implementation of selected EoS introduces additional computational costs
although using lookup table methods can significantly reduce the overhead by a
factor $3\sim 4$.

several decades, resulting in the discovery of many universal properties and
reoccurring characteristics of different kinds of networks. However, much less
is known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality
are not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.
  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution
patterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific
patterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a
""one fits it all"" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these
intuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables
and metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as
for interpolating graph evolutions.
  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,
this paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node
importance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality
distance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given
centrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances
reflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in
case of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.
  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and
seven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the
usefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared
to a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the
considered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the
dynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.

applications and many techniques have been recently developed for its solution,
to the best of our knowledge nobody provided a rigorous theoretical analysis of
this important setup. The purpose of the present paper is to fill in this gap.
  We consider one of the most common settings, classification of
high-dimensional normal vectors where, unlike standard assumptions, the number
of classes could be large. We derive non-asymptotic conditions on effects of
significant features, and the low and the upper bounds for distances between
classes required for successful feature selection and classification with a
given accuracy. Furthermore, we study an asymptotic setup where the number of
classes is diverging with the dimension of feature space and while the number
of samples per class is possibly limited. We point out on an interesting and,
at first glance, somewhat counter-intuitive phenomenon that a large number of
classes may be a ""blessing"" rather than a ""curse"" since, in certain settings,
the precision of classification can improve as the number of classes grows.
This is due to more accurate feature selection since even weaker significant
features, which are not sufficiently strong to be manifested in a coarse
classification, being shared across the classes, have a stronger impact as the
number of classes increases. We supplement our theoretical investigation by a
simulation study and a real data example where we again observe the above
phenomenon.

resonant optical force can also be completely attributed to an electric dipole
resonance in the alternative field-representation, where the electromagnetic
fields in the source-free region are expressed by two sets of electric and
magnetic multipole fields based on symmetry. The confusion is resolved by
conceptually introducing the irreducible electric dipole, toroidal dipole, and

powerful tool to identify toroidal response even when its scattering intensity

long wave interfacial fluctuations when the Reynolds number based on the mean

the angle of inclination with the horizontal increases, and in particular
becomes zero when the plate is vertical). Control of these interfacial
instabilities is relevant to a wide range of industrial applications including
coating processes and heat or mass transfer systems. This study considers the
effect of blowing and suction through the substrate in order to construct from
first principles physically realistic models that can be used for detailed
passive and active control studies of direct relevance to possible experiments.
Two different long-wave, thin-film equations are derived to describe this
system; these include the imposed blowing/suction as well as inertia, surface
tension, gravity and viscosity. The case of spatially periodic blowing and
suction is considered in detail and the bifurcation structure of forced steady
states is explored numerically to predict that steady states cease to exist for
sufficiently large suction speeds since the film locally thins to zero
thickness giving way to dry patches on the substrate. The linear stability of
the resulting nonuniform steady states is investigated for perturbations of
arbitrary wavelengths, and any instabilities are followed into the fully
nonlinear regime using time-dependent computations. The case of small amplitude
blowing/suction is studied analytically both for steady states and their
stability. Finally, the transition between travelling waves and non-uniform
steady states is explored as the suction amplitude increases.

  Aims: Our objective is to develop a new method, which aims to circumvent

aspect, namely a secular resonance between the dwarf planet Ceres and other
asteroids. We demonstrate that this type of secular resonance can be the
dominant dynamical factor in certain regions of the main asteroid belt.
  Specifically, we performed a dynamical analysis of the asteroids belonging to
the (1726) Hoffmeister family. To identify which dynamical mechanisms are
actually at work in this part of the main asteroid belt, i.e. to isolate the
main perturber(s), we study the evolution of this family in time. The study is
accomplished using numerical integrations of test particles performed within
different dynamical models. The obtained results reveal that the post-impact
evolution of the Hoffmeister asteroid family is a direct consequence of the
nodal secular resonance with Ceres.
  This leads us to the conclusion that similar effects must exist in other
parts of the asteroid belt. In this respect, the obtained results shed light on
an important and entirely new aspect of the long-term dynamics of small bodies.
Ceres' fingerprint in asteroid dynamics, expressed through the discovered
secular resonance effect, completely changes our understanding of the way in
which perturbations by Ceres-like objects affect the orbits of nearby bodies.

preserving the stability as the waiting time. We extend this idea to the
$L_2$-gain and ISS analysis of perturbed networked control systems with

layer is sufficiently thick or the slope sufficiently steep. This free surface
flow of a single fluid layer has industrial applications including coating and

Here we discuss how the dynamics of the system are altered by feedback controls
based on observations of the interface height, and supplied to the system via
the perpendicular injection and suction of fluid through the wall. In this
study, we model the system using both Benney and weighted-residual models that
account for the fluid injection through the wall. We find that feedback using
injection and suction is a remarkably effective control mechanism: the controls
can be used to drive the system towards arbitrary steady states and travelling
waves, and the qualitative effects are independent of the details of the flow
modelling. Furthermore, we show that the system can still be successfully
controlled when the feedback is applied via a set of localised actuators and
only a small number of system observations are available, and that this is
possible using both static (where the controls are based on only the most
recent set of observations) and dynamic (where the controls are based on an
approximation of the system which evolves over time) control schemes. This
study thus provides a solid theoretical foundation for future experimental
realisations of the control of falling liquid films.

to other papers in the univariate case, the coefficients depend on time but not
on the length of the series $n$. Under appropriate assumptions, it is shown
that a Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is almost surely consistent
and asymptotically normal. The theoretical results are illustrated by means of
two examples of bivariate processes. It is shown that the assumptions
underlying the theoretical results apply. In the second example the innovations
are also marginally heteroscedastic with a correlation ranging from -0.8 to
0.8. In the two examples, the asymptotic information matrix is obtained in the
Gaussian case. Finally, the finite-sample behaviour is checked via a Monte

significant spatial variability in the 5-{\mu}m brightness temperatures, the
shape of the spectra remain very similar across the planet, suggesting the
presence of a spectrally-flat, spatially inhomogeneous cloud deck. We find that
a simple cloud model consisting of a single, compact cloud is able to reproduce
both nightside and dayside spectra, subject to the following constraints: (i)
the cloud base is located at pressures of 1.2 bar or lower; (ii) the cloud

opacity and the phosphine deep volume mixing ratio. We find that the vast

the thickness of the cloud decks, with huge differences between the cloudy

there is a small probability that a mesoscopic heat engine exceeds Carnot's

a quantum point contact as a heat engine. When a temperature difference is
applied to a quantum point contact, the system may be utilized as a source of

differential abundance analysis of the XO-2 wide stellar binary based on high
resolution HARPS-N@TNG spectra. Both components are very similar K-dwarfs and
host planets. Since they formed presumably within the same molecular cloud, we
expect they should possess the same initial elemental abundances. We
investigate if the presence of planets can cause some chemical imprints in the
stellar atmospheric abundances. We measure abundances of 25 elements for both
stars with a range of condensation temperature $T_{\rm C}=40-1741$ K, achieving
typical precisions of $\sim 0.07$ dex. The North component shows abundances in
all elements higher by $+0.067 \pm 0.032$ dex on average, with a mean
difference of +0.078 dex for elements with $T_{\rm C} > 800$ K. The
significance of the XO-2N abundance difference relative to XO-2S is at the
$2\sigma$ level for almost all elements. We discuss the possibility that this
result could be interpreted as the signature of the ingestion of material by
XO-2N or depletion in XO-2S due to locking of heavy elements by the planetary
companions. We estimate a mass of several tens of $M_{\oplus}$ in heavy
elements. The difference in abundances between XO-2N and XO-2S shows a positive
correlation with the condensation temperatures of the elements, with a slope of
$(4.7 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{-5}$ dex K$^{-1}$, which could mean that both
components have not formed terrestrial planets, but that first experienced the
accretion of rocky core interior to the subsequent giant planets.

fitted deterministic intensity shape and then have obtained an intercorrelation
peak with a sufficient signal to noise ratio to safely distinguish this peak
from random fluctuations. A 95% confidence interval has been determined,
confirming a high degree of paradox whatever the considered single pairs. Last,
we have verified that the value of the variance of the difference between twin
images is always below the quantum (poissonian) limit, in order to ensure the

non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation for Fe I and Fe II in

0.06 dex for every benchmark star, when applying a scaling factor of S_H = 0.5
to the Drawinian rates of inelastic Fe+H collisions. The obtained atmospheric
parameters were checked for each program star by comparing its position in the
log g-Teff plane with the theoretical evolutionary track in the Yi et al.

of Alonso et al. (1996) and Casagrande et al. (2011), with a mean difference of
+46 K and -51 K, respectively. NLTE leads to higher surface gravity compared
with that for LTE. The shift in log g is smaller than 0.1 dex for stars with
either [Fe/H] > -0.75, or Teff < 5750 K, or log g > 4.20. NLTE analysis is
crucial for the VMP turn-off and subgiant stars, for which the shift in log g
between NLTE and LTE can be up to 0.5 dex. The obtained atmospheric parameters

capillary bridge on two parallel plates, allows to measure an effective surface
tension of the complex fluid and to investigate the influence of flow history.
More precisely the effective surface tension measured after stretching the
bridge is always higher than after compressing it. The difference between the
two values is due to the existence of a yield stress in the fluid. The
experimental observations are successfully reproduced with a simple
elasto-plastic model. The shape of successive stretching-compression cycles can
be described by taking into account the yield stress and the elasticity of the
gel. We show that the surface tension $\gamma_{LV}$ of yield stress fluids is
the mean of the effective surface tension values only if the elastic modulus is
high compared to the yield stress. This work highlights that thermodynamical
quantities measurements are challenged by the fluid out-of-equilibrium state
implied by jamming, even at small scales where the shape of the bridge is
driven by surface energy. Therefore setups allowing deformation in opposite
directions are relevant for measurements on yield stress fluids.

we develop the framework that generates families of multi-link states that
preserve the area law while avoiding macroscopic entanglement, the space-time
analogue of ""Schroedinger cat"". We note that these states, defined on a given
set of graphs, are the ground states of some local Hamiltonian that can be
constructed explicitly. This can potentially shed light on the construction of
the appropriate Hamiltonian constraints in the LQG framework.

discovery of gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. To
maximise both the confidence of the detection and the science return, it is
essential to identify an electromagnetic counterpart. This is not trivial, as
the events are expected to be poorly localised, particularly in the near-term,
with error regions covering hundreds or even thousands of square degrees. In
this paper we discuss the prospects for finding an X-ray counterpart to a
gravitational wave trigger with the Swift X-ray Telescope, using the assumption
that the trigger is caused by a binary neutron star merger which also produces
a short gamma-ray burst. We show that it is beneficial to target galaxies
within the GW error region, highlighting the need for substantially complete
galaxy catalogues out to distances of 300 Mpc. We also show that nearby,
on-axis short GRBs are either extremely rare, or are systematically less
luminous than those detected to date. We consider the prospects for detecting
afterglow emission from an an off-axis GRB which triggered the GW facilities,
finding that the detectability, and the best time to look, are strongly
dependent on the characteristics of the burst such as circumburst density and
our viewing angle.

that this class is in bijection with a subset of negative definite functions

this class and a self-adjoint Markov semigroup, whose spectral expansion is
expressed in terms of the classical Laguerre polynomials. As a by-product, we
derive smoothness properties for the solution to the associated Cauchy problem

possible decays, including the hypocoercivity type phenomena, for the speed of
convergence to equilibrium for this class and enables us to provide an
interpretation of these in terms of the rate of growth of the weighted Hilbert

several strategies, which require new developments in a variety of contexts, to

can avoid node crossings when their nodal points are at perihelion and at
aphelion. This layout protects the asteroids from close encounters, and
eventual collisions, with the host planet.
  Aims. Here, we study the short-term dynamical evolution of four recently
discovered near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) --2012 FC71, 2014 EK24, 2014 QD364, and
2014 UR-- that follow very Earth-like orbits.
  Methods. Our analysis is based on results of direct N-body calculations that
use the most updated ephemerides and include perturbations from the eight major
planets, the Moon, the barycentre of the Pluto-Charon system, and the three
largest asteroids.
  Results. These four NEAs exhibit an orbital evolution unlike any other known
near-Earth object (NEO). Beyond horseshoe, tadpole, or quasi-satellite
trajectories, they follow co-orbital passing orbits relative to the Earth
within the Kozai domain. Our calculations show that secular interactions induce
librations of their relative argument of perihelion with respect to our planet
but also to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Secular chaos is also present. The size
of this transient population is probably large.
  Conclusions. Although some of these NEAs can remain orbitally stable for many
thousands of years, their secular dynamics are substantially more complicated
than commonly thought and cannot be properly described within the framework of
the three-body problem alone owing to the overlapping of multiple secular
resonances. Objects in this group are amongst the most atypical NEOs regarding
favourable visibility windows because these are separated in time by many
decades or even several centuries.

  figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interfaces and low dimensionality are sources of strong modifications of
electronic, structural, and magnetic properties of materials. FeRh alloys are
an excellent example because of the first-order phase transition taking place
at $\sim$400 K from an antiferromagnetic phase at room temperature to a high
temperature ferromagnetic one. It is accompanied by a resistance change and
volume expansion of about 1\%. We have investigated the electronic and magnetic
properties of FeRh(100) epitaxially grown on MgO by combining spectroscopies
characterized by different probing depths, namely X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism and photoelectron spectroscopy. We thus reveal that the symmetry
breaking induced at the Rh-terminated surface stabilizes a surface
ferromagnetic layer involving five planes of Fe and Rh atoms in the nominally
antiferromagnetic phase at room temperature. First-principles calculations
provide a microscopic description of the structural relaxation and the electron
spin-density distribution that fully support the experimental findings.

systems on European scale for different (future) time periods. The tool is to
use for users and be applicable for different building systems. Users should
also be able to use a broad range of climate parameters to assess the influence
of climate change on these climatic parameters. Also should the calculation
time be reasonable short. The mapping tool is developed in MATLAB, which can be
used by other users for their own studies.
