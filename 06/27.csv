(exclusive-or) cellular automata under noise. The model is closely related with
the Domany-Kinzel probabilistic cellular automaton, for which there are
rigorous as well as numerical estimates on the transition probabilities. Here
we characterize the critical behavior of the noisy additive cellular automaton
by mean field analysis and finite-size scaling and show that its phase
transition belongs to the directed percolation universality class of critical
behavior. As a by-product of our analysis, we argue that the critical behavior
of the noisy elementary CA 90 and 102 (in Wolfram's enumeration scheme) must be
the same. We also perform an empirical investigation of the mean field
equations to assess their quality and find that away from the critical point
(but not necessarily very far away) the mean field approximations provide a
reasonably good description of the dynamics of the PCA.

2015, one large Content Distribution Network handles 50 billion IPv6 requests
per day from hundreds of millions of IPv6 client addresses; billions of unique
client addresses are observed per month. Address counts, however, obscure the
number of hosts with IPv6 connectivity to the global Internet. There are
numerous address assignment and subnetting options in use; privacy addresses
and dynamic subnet pools significantly inflate the number of active IPv6
addresses. As the IPv6 address space is vast, it is infeasible to
comprehensively probe every possible unicast IPv6 address. Thus, to survey the
characteristics of IPv6 addressing, we perform a year-long passive measurement
study, analyzing the IPv6 addresses gleaned from activity logs for all clients
accessing a global CDN.
  The goal of our work is to develop flexible classification and measurement
methods for IPv6, motivated by the fact that its addresses are not merely more
numerous; they are different in kind. We introduce the notion of classifying
addresses and prefixes in two ways: (1) temporally, according to their
instances of activity to discern which addresses can be considered stable; (2)
spatially, according to the density or sparsity of aggregates in which active
addresses reside. We present measurement and classification results numerically
and visually that: provide details on IPv6 address use and structure in global
operation across the past year; establish the efficacy of our classification
methods; and demonstrate that such classification can clarify dimensions of the
Internet that otherwise appear quite blurred by current IPv6 addressing
practices.

a new method to show this was due to the presence of frequency fluctuations, of

width: ${\theta}_{rotation}={\theta}_{corner}/2$. The velocity at which this
rotation occurs is also affected by the angle of the corners, being faster for
fractal and star-like nozzles which have small ${\theta}_{corner}$. Therefore
it has been found that the velocity of the rotation is associated with enhanced

are dictated by the vorticity field and, in particular, by the positive and
negative ${\omega}_x$ layers generated at each corner. The comparison between

the ground state (i.e. the minimum energy configuration) of a cost function

this approach maximises the likelihood that the solution found is correct. An
alternative approach is to make use of prior statistical information about the
noise in conjunction with Bayes's theorem. The maximum entropy solution to the
problem then takes the form of a Boltzmann distribution over the ground and
excited states of the cost function. Here we use a programmable Josephson
junction array for the information decoding problem which we simulate as a
random Ising model in a field. We show experimentally that maximum entropy
decoding at finite temperature can in certain cases give competitive and even
slightly better bit-error-rates than the maximum likelihood approach at zero
temperature, confirming that useful information can be extracted from the
excited states of the annealing device. Furthermore we introduce a microscopic
bit-by-bit analytical method which is agnostic to the specific application and
use it to show that the annealing device samples from a highly Boltzmann-like
distribution. Machines of this kind are therefore candidates for use in a wide
variety of machine learning applications which exploit maximum entropy
inference, including natural language processing and image recognition. We
further show that the limiting factor for performance in our experiments is
likely to be control errors rather than failure to reach equilibrium. Our work
also provides a method for determining if a system is in equilibrium which can
be easily generalized. We discuss possible applications of this method to spin
glasses and probing the performance of the quantum annealing algorithm.

for detecting, discriminating, and ultimately testing, SOC have played a
critical role in developing our understanding of how systems experience and

correlations to complexity to critical quantities. A description of the basic
autocorrelation method leads into a detailed analysis of application-oriented

unambiguously detect SOC in data often leads us outside the comfort zone of our

the advances made in other fields of study. In addition, numerical detection
methods often provide the optimum link between simulations and experiments in
scientific research. We seek to explore this boundary where the rubber meets

is related to restricted mobility and structure formation of the liquid in this
region, in agreement with information obtained from a long-time ellipsometric
study of thinning TEHOS films on silicon substrates with 100 nm thermal or 2 nm
native oxide. Both show evidence for the formation of up to four layers.
Additionally, on thermal oxide, a lateral flow of the liquid is observed, while
the film on the native oxide forms an almost flat surface and shows negligible
flow. Thus, on the 2 nm native oxide the liquid mobility is even more
restricted in close vicinity to the substrate as compared to the 100 nm thermal
oxide. In addition, we found a significantly smaller initial film thickness in

thermalizing $\rho$ to a thermal state $\sigma$ at temperature $T$ of an

characterized by how reversible the process is. More specifically, this entropy
production depends on how well we can return the state $\sigma$ to its original

production can be linked to the work that can be extracted along a given

Metropolis-Hastings algorithms can be applied when it is computationally
expensive to calculate the true posterior or an unbiased stochastic
approximation thereof, but a computationally cheap deterministic approximation
is available. An initial accept-reject stage uses the cheap approximation for
computing the Metropolis-Hastings ratio; proposals which are accepted at this
stage are then subjected to a further accept-reject step which corrects for the
error in the approximation. Since the expensive posterior, or the approximation
thereof, is only evaluated for proposals which are accepted at the first stage,
the cost of the algorithm is reduced and larger scalings may be used.

delayed-acceptance RWM and the delayed-acceptance pseudo-marginal RWM. We
provide a framework for incorporating relatively general deterministic
approximations into the theoretical analysis of high-dimensional targets.
Justified by diffusion approximation arguments, we derive expressions for the
limiting efficiency and acceptance rates in high-dimensional settings. These
theoretical insights are finally leveraged to formulate practical guidelines

the possibility of accessing quantum-mechanical scenarios that seemed

modern optomechanical setups are mature enough to implement one of the most
elusive models in the field of open system dynamics: degenerate parametric
oscillation. The possibility of implementing it in nonlinear optical resonators
was the main motivation for introducing such model in the eighties, which
rapidly became a paradigm for the study of dissipative phase transitions whose
corresponding spontaneously broken symmetry is discrete. However, it was found
that the intrinsic multimode nature of optical cavities makes it impossible to
experimentally study the model all the way through its phase transition. In
contrast, here we show that this long-awaited model can be implemented in the
motion of a mechanical object dispersively coupled to the light contained in a
cavity, when the latter is properly driven with multi-chromatic laser light. We
focus on membranes as the mechanical element, showing that the main signatures
of the degenerate parametric oscillation model can be studied in
state-of-the-art setups, thus opening the possibility of studying spontaneous
symmetry breaking and enhanced metrology in one of the cleanest dissipative

standard tools from information theory, we establish a minimax lower bound for

star formation in the region, that was probably triggered by the expansion of
the ionization front. We use 870 micron data obtained with LABOCA to map the
dust emission. The obtained LABOCA image was compared to archival IR,radio
continuum, and optical images. The 870 micron emission follows the 8 micron
(Spitzer), 250 micron, and 500 micron (Herschel) emission distributions showing
the classical morphology of a spherical shell. We use the 870 micron and 250
micron images to identify 60 dust clumps in the collected layers of molecular
gas using the Gaussclumps algorithm. The clumps have effective deconvolved
radii between 0.16 pc and 1.35 pc, masses between 70 Mo and 2800 Mo, and volume
densities between 1.1x10^3 cm^-3 and 2.04x10^5 cm^-3. The total mass of the
clumps is 37600 Mo. The dust temperature of the clumps is in the range from 21
K to 32 K, while inside the HII region reaches ~ 40 K. The clump mass
distribution is well-fitted by a power law dN/dlog(M/Mo) proportional to
M^(-alpha), with alpha=0.93+/-0.28. The slope differs from those obtained for
the stellar IMF in the solar neighborhood, suggesting that the clumps are not
direct progenitors of single stars/protostars. The mass-radius relationship for
the 41 clumps detected in the 870 microns emission shows that only 37% of them
lie in or above the high-mass star formation threshold, most of them having
candidate YSOs projected inside. A comparison of the dynamical age of the HII
region with the fragmentation time, allowed us to conclude that the collect and
collapse mechanism may be important for the star formation at the edge of Gum
31, although other processes may also be acting.

role of pre-formed aggregates in biofilm development. Focusing on the initial
shape the aggregate forms on the surface, we find that the degree of spreading
of an aggregate on a surface can play an important role in determining its
eventual fate during biofilm development. Specifically, initially spread
aggregates perform better when competition with surrounding unaggregated
bacterial cells is low, while initially rounded aggregates perform better when
competition with surrounding unaggregated cells is high. These contrasting
outcomes are governed by a trade-off between aggregate surface area and height.
Our results provide new insight into biofilm formation and development, and
reveal new factors that may be at play in the social evolution of biofilm
communities.

finding correlation structures in multi-view datasets. In this paper, we tackle
the problem of large scale CCA, where classical algorithms, usually requiring
computing the product of two huge matrices and huge matrix decomposition, are
computationally and storage expensive. We recast CCA from a novel perspective
and propose a scalable and memory efficient Augmented Approximate Gradient
(AppGrad) scheme for finding top $k$ dimensional canonical subspace which only
involves large matrix multiplying a thin matrix of width $k$ and small matrix
decomposition of dimension $k\times k$. Further, AppGrad achieves optimal
storage complexity $O(k(p_1+p_2))$, compared with classical algorithms which
usually require $O(p_1^2+p_2^2)$ space to store two dense whitening matrices.
The proposed scheme naturally generalizes to stochastic optimization regime,
especially efficient for huge datasets where batch algorithms are prohibitive.
The online property of stochastic AppGrad is also well suited to the streaming
scenario, where data comes sequentially. To the best of our knowledge, it is
the first stochastic algorithm for CCA. Experiments on four real data sets are
provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

However, the envelope can be unstable at an intermediate scale of perturbations
with $0<k<1$. Thus, the modulated IAW packets can propagate in the form of
bright envelope solitons or rogons (at small- and medium scale perturbations)
as well as dark envelope solitons (at large scale). The stable and unstable
regions are obtained for different values of temperature and density ratios as
well as the nonextensive parameters $q_c$ and $q_h$ for cool and hot electrons.
It is found that the more (less) the population of superthermal cool (hot)

for a simultaneous fit that uses a unique temperature profile, assuming a clear
(no-haze) and pure N_2 atmosphere, but allowing for a possible pressure
variation between the two dates. We find a solution that fits satisfactorily
(i.e. within the noise level) all the twelve light-curves, providing
atmospheric constraints between ~1,190 km (pressure ~ 11 \mubar) and ~ 1,450 km
(pressure ~0.1 \mubar) from Pluto's center. Our main results are: (1) the
best-fitting temperature profile shows a stratosphere with strong positive
gradient between 1,190 km (at 36 K, 11 \mubar) and r = 1,215 km (6.0 \mubar),
where a temperature maximum of 110 K is reached; above it is a mesosphere with
negative thermal gradient of -0.2 K/km up to ~ 1,390 km (0.25 \mubar), where,
the mesosphere connects itself to a more isothermal upper branch around 81 K;
(2) the pressure shows a small (6 %) but significant increase (6-\sigma level)
between the two dates; (3) without troposphere, Pluto's radius is found to be
R_P = 1,190 +/- 5km. Allowing for a troposphere, R_P is constrained to lie
between 1,168 and 1,195 km; (4) the currently measured CO abundance is too
small to explain the mesospheric negative thermal gradient. Cooling by HCN is
possible, but only if this species is largely saturated; Alternative
explanations like zonal winds or vertical compositional variations of the
atmosphere are unable to explain the observed mesospheric trend.

stationary nonlinear solutions in one-dimensional plasmonic slot waveguides
made of a finite-thickness nonlinear dielectric core surrounded by metal
regions. These two methods are described in detail in the preceding article
[Walasik et al., submitted]. For symmetric waveguides, we provide the nonlinear
dispersion curves obtained using the two methods and compare them. We describe
the well known low-order modes and the higher-modes that were not described
before. All the modes are classified into two families: modes with and without
nodes. We also compare nonlinear modes with nodes with the linear modes in
similar linear slot waveguides with a homogeneous core. We recover the symmetry
breaking Hopf bifurcation of the first symmetric nonlinear mode toward an
asymmetric mode and we show that one of the higher modes also exhibits a
bifurcation. We study the behavior of the bifurcation of the fundamental mode
as a function of the permittivities of a metal and a nonlinear core. We
demonstrate that the bifurcation can be obtained at low power levels in
structures with optimized parameters. Moreover, we provide the dispersion
curves for asymmetric nonlinear slot waveguides. Finally, we give results
concerning the stability of the fundamental symmetric mode and the asymmetric
mode that bifurcates from it using both theoretical argument and numerical
propagation simulations from two different full-vector methods. We investigate
also the stability properties of the first antisymmetric mode using our two
numerical propagation methods.

cosmological magnetic fields during the Epoch of Reionization. It is based on
the photoionization of the Intergalactic Medium by the first sources formed in
the Universe. First the induction equation is derived, then the characteristic
length and time scales of the mechanism are identified, and finally numerical
applications are carried out for first stars, primordial galaxies and distant
powerful quasars. In these simple examples, the strength of the generated
magnetic fields varies between the order of $10^{-23}$ G on hundreds of
kiloparsecs to $10^{-19}$ G on hundreds of parsecs in the neutral Intergalactic
Medium between the Str\""omgren spheres of the sources. Thus this mechanism
contributes to the premagnetization of the whole Universe before large scale
structures are in place. It operates with any ionizing source, at any time
during the Epoch of Reionization. Finally, the generated fields possess a
characteristic spatial configuration which may help discriminate these seeds
from those produced by different mechanisms.

particular, we show that in the asymptotic limit, the minimum amount of noise
that is required to fully decohere a quantum system, is equal to the relative
entropy of coherence. This quantifies the erasure cost of quantum coherence. We
employ the entropy exchanged between system and environment during the
decohering operation and the memory required to store the information about the

achieved in cuprates1 is 133 K at ambient pressure2 and 164 K at high
pressures3. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials has still not
been explained, the prospects for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast, the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory gives a guide for achieving high Tc and
does not put bounds on Tc, all that is needed is a favorable combination of
high frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of
states. These conditions can be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent
compounds dominated by hydrogen4,5. Numerous calculations support this idea and
predict Tc of 50-235 K for many hydrides6 but only moderate Tc=17 K has been
observed experimentally7. Here we studied sulfur hydride8 where a Tc~80 K was
predicted9. We found that it transforms to a metal at pressure ~90 GPa. With
cooling superconductivity was found deduced from a sharp drop of the
resistivity to zero and a decrease of Tc with magnetic field. The pronounce
isotope shift of Tc in D2S is evidence of an electron-phonon mechanism of
superconductivity that is consistent with the BCS scenario. The
superconductivity has been confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements
with Tc=203K. The high Tc superconductivity most likely is due to H3S which is
formed from H2S under its decomposition under pressure. Even higher Tc, room
temperature superconductivity, can be expected in other hydrogen-based
materials since hydrogen atoms provide the high frequency phonon modes as well
as the strong electron-phonon coupling.

However, our simulations also show that the self-gravity of the tidal stream,

sufficiently stabilize an additional PeV particle, produce its abundance

condenses into clouds. The stability of the clouds determines whether they will
be turned into stars or can be delivered to the central supermassive black hole
(SMBH) to turn on an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The conventional criteria
to assess the stability of these clouds, such as the Jeans criterion and Roche
(or tidal) limit, are insufficient here, because they assume the dominance of
self-gravity in binding a cloud, and neglect external agents, such as pressure
and tidal forces, which are common in galactic nuclei. We formulate a new
scheme for judging this stability. We first revisit the conventional Virial
theorem, taking into account an external pressure, to identify the correct
range of masses that lead to stable clouds. We then extend the theorem to
include an external tidal field, crucial for the stability in the region of
interest -- in dense star clusters, around SMBHs. We apply our extended Virial
theorem to find the correct solutions to practical problems that until now were
controversial, namely, the stability of the gas clumps in AGN tori, the
circum-nuclear disk in the Galactic Center, and the central molecular zone of
the Milky Way. The masses we derive for these structures are orders of
magnitude smaller than the commonly-used Virial masses (equivalent to the Jeans
mass). Moreover, we prove that these clumps are stable, contrary to what one
would naively deduce from the Roche (tidal) limit.

composed by several stellar populations, characterized by different chemical
compositions. Different populations show different ages in NSCs but not
necessarily in GCs. The youngest populations in NSCs appear to reside in
disk-like structures, as observed in our Galaxy and in M31. Gas infall followed
by formation of second generation (SG) stars in GCs may similarly form
disk-like structures in the clusters nuclei. Here we explore this possibility
and follow the long term evolution of stellar disks embedded in GCs, and study
their effects on the evolution of the clusters. We study disks with different
masses by means of detailed N-body simulations and explore their morphological
and kinematic signatures on the GC structures. We find that as a second
generation disk relaxes, the old, first generation, stellar population flattens
and becomes more radially anisotropic, making the GC structure become more
elliptical. The second generation stellar population is characterized by a
lower velocity dispersion, and a higher rotational velocity, compared with the
primordial older population. The strength of these kinematic signatures depends
both on the relaxation time of the system and on the fractional mass of the
second generation disk. We therefore conclude that SG populations formed in
flattened configurations will give rise to two systematic trends: (1) Positive
correlation between GC ellipticity and fraction of SG population (2) Positive
correlation between GC relaxation time and ellipticity. Thereby GC
ellipticities and rotation could be related to the formation of SG stars and
their initial configuration.

we find one object with a robust LyC detection that is not due to foreground
contamination. This object (MD5) resolves into two components; we refer to the
LyC-emitting component as MD5b. MD5b has an observed 1500\AA\ to 900\AA\
flux-density ratio of $(F_{UV}/F_{LyC})_{obs}=4.0\pm2.0$, compatible with
predictions from stellar population synthesis models. Assuming minimal IGM
absorption, this ratio corresponds to a relative (absolute) escape fraction of
$f_{esc,rel}^{MD5b}=75-100$% ($f_{esc,abs}^{MD5b}=14-19$%). The stellar
population fit to MD5b indicates an age of $\lesssim50$Myr, which is in the

and substrate material to develop next generation graphene-based electronic
devices. In this paper, we investigate the quantum transport in
heterostructures consisting of a few atomic layers thick hBN film sandwiched
between graphene nanoribbon electrodes. We show a gate-controllable vertical
transistor exhibiting strong negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with
multiple resonant peaks, which stay pronounced for various device dimensions.
We find two distinct mechanisms that are responsible for NDR, depending on the
gate and applied biases, in the same device. The origin of first mechanism is a
Fabry-P\'e like interference and that of the second mechanism is an in-plane
wave vector matching when the Dirac points of the electrodes align. The hBN
layers can induce an asymmetry in the current-voltage characteristics which can
be further modulated by an applied bias. We find that the electron-phonon
scattering introduces the decoherence and therefore suppresses first mechanism
whereas second mechanism remains relatively unaffected. We also show that the
NDR features are tunable by varying device dimensions. The NDR feature with
multiple resonant peaks, combined with the ultrafast tunneling speed provides
prospect for the graphene-hBN-graphene heterostructure in the high-performance
electronics.

stars and stellar streams) of the stellar-kinematic samples that are used to
infer dark matter densities in `ultrafaint' dSphs. Applying standard kinematic
analyses to hundreds of mock data sets that include varying levels of

be overestimated by orders of magnitude. Stellar-kinematic data sets for which

are sensitive to specific choices about how to weight and/or to exclude stars

displays both of these characteristics. Estimates of Segue~I's J-factor should
therefore be regarded with a larger degree of caution when planning and

the stability of 1D boundary layer solutions to (time-dependent) PNP systems,
we estimate the solution of the perturbed problem with global

ultraviolet-to-near-infrared spectral range. It implements a point-like source
placed at a finite distance from the telescope entrance pupil, yielding a flat
field illumination that covers the entire field of view of the imager. The
purpose of this system is to perform a lightweight routine monitoring of the
imager passbands with a precision better than 5 per-mil on the relative
passband normalisations and about 3{\AA} on the filter cutoff positions. The
light source is calibrated on a spectrophotometric bench. As our fundamental
metrology standard, we use a photodiode calibrated at NIST. The radiant
intensity of each beam is mapped, and spectra are measured for each LED. All
measurements are conducted at temperatures ranging from 0{\deg}C to 25{\deg}C
in order to study the temperature dependence of the system. The photometric and
spectroscopic measurements are combined into a model that predicts the spectral
intensity of the source as a function of temperature. We find that the
calibration beams are stable at the $10^{-4}$ level -- after taking the slight
temperature dependence of the LED emission properties into account. We show
that the spectral intensity of the source can be characterised with a precision
of 3{\AA} in wavelength. In flux, we reach an accuracy of about 0.2-0.5%
depending on how we understand the off-diagonal terms of the error budget
affecting the calibration of the NIST photodiode. With a routine 60-mn
calibration program, the apparatus is able to constrain the passbands at the
targeted precision levels.

Kolmogorov's probability theory well-constructed because it treats stochastic
independence as a ""numerical accident,"" while it should be treated as a
fundamental relation, more basic than the assignment of numerical
probabilities. I argue here that stochastic independence is indeed a ""numerical
accident,"" a special form of stochastic dependence between random variables
(most broadly defined). The idea that it is fundamental may owe its
attractiveness to the confusion of stochastic independence with stochastic
unrelatedness, the situation when two or more random variables have no joint
distribution, ""have nothing to do with each other."" Kolmogorov's probability
theory cannot be consistently constructed without allowing for stochastic
unrelatedness, in fact making it a default situation: any two random variables
recorded under mutually incompatible conditions are stochastically unrelated.
However, stochastically unrelated random variables can always be
probabilistically coupled, i.e., imposed a joint distribution upon, and this
generally can be done in an infinity of ways, independent coupling being merely
one of them. The notions of stochastic unrelatedness and all possible couplings
play a central role in the foundation of probability theory and, especially, in
the theory of probabilistic contextuality.

based on the Zeeman observations analyzed by Crutcher et al. (2010). We show
that their finding that the 3D magnetic field scales approximately as
density$^{0.65}$ can also be obtained from analysis of the observed
line-of-sight fields. We present two large-scale AMR MHD simulations of several
thousand $M_\odot$ of turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas, one with a
strong initial magnetic field (Alfven Mach number $M_{A,0}= 1$) and one with a
weak initial field ($M_{A,0}=10$). We construct samples of the 100 most massive
clumps in each simulation and show that they exhibit a power-law relation
between field strength and density in excellent agreement with the observed
one. Our results imply that the average field in molecular clumps in the
interstellar medium is $<B_{tot}> \sim 42 n_{H,4}^{0.65} \mu$G. Furthermore,
the median value of the ratio of the line-of-sight field to density$^{0.65}$ in
the simulations is within a factor of about (1.3, 1.7) of the observed value
for the strong and weak field cases, respectively. The median value of the
mass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70% of the
line-of-sight value. This is larger than the 50% usually cited for spherical
clouds because the actual mass-to-flux ratio depends on the volume-weighted
field, whereas the observed one depends on the mass-weighted field. Our results
indicate that the typical molecular clump in the ISM is significantly
supercritical (~ factor of 3). The results of our strong-field model are in
very good quantitative agreement with the observations of Li et al. (2009),
which show a strong correlation in field orientation between small and large
scales. Because there is a negligible correlation in the weak-field model, we
conclude that molecular clouds form from strongly magnetized (although
magnetically supercritical) gas.

interest rates that are extremely high by modern standards (100% and higher)
are necessary within a zero-sum monetary system, and not just driven by greed.
Extreme interest rates that appeared in various places and times reinforce the
idea that hard money may have contributed to high rates of interest. Here a
model is presented that examines the interest rate required to succeed as an
investor in a zero-sum fixed quantity hard-money system. Even when the playing
field is significantly tilted toward the investor, interest rates need to be
much higher than expected. In a completely fair zero-sum system, an investor
cannot break even without charging 100% interest. Even with a 5% advantage, an
investor won't break even at 15% interest. From this it is concluded that what
we consider usurious rates today are, within a hard-money system, driven by
necessity.
  Cryptocurrency is a novel form of hard-currency. The inability to virtualize
the money creates a system close to zero-sum because of the limited supply
design. Therefore, within the bounds of a cryptocurrency system that limits
money creation, interest rates must rise to levels that the modern world
considers usury. It is impossible, therefore, that a cryptocurrency that is not
expandable could take over a modern economy and replace modern fiat currency.

electronic insulators while harboring metallic, conductive surfaces. In

electrical conduction, intuitively making the material more electrically
resistive. Peculiarly, 3D TIs should become better conductors when they are
cracked because the cracks themselves, which act as conductive topological
surfaces, provide additional paths for the electrical current. Significantly,
for a TI material, any surface or extended defect harbors such conduction. In
this letter, we demonstrate that small subsurface cracks formed within the
predicted 3D TI samarium hexaboride (SmB$_{6}$) via systematic scratching or
sanding results in such an increase in the electrical conduction. SmB$_{6}$ is
in a unique position among TIs to exhibit this effect because its
single-crystals are thick enough to harbor cracks, and because it remarkably
does not appear to suffer from conduction through bulk impurities. Our results
not only strengthen the building case for SmB$_{6}$'s topological nature, but
are relevant to all TIs with cracks, including TI films with grain boundaries.

mapping. The number of non-overlapping seeds a mapper selects determines the
sensitivity of the mapper while the total frequency of all selected seeds
determines the speed of the mapper. Modern seed-and-extend mappers usually
select seeds with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible
placement scheme, both of which limit the potential of the mapper to select
less frequent seeds to speed up the mapping process. Therefore, it is crucial
to develop a new algorithm that can adjust both the individual seed length and
the seed placement, as well as derive less frequent seeds.
  Results: We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming
algorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an
L-bp read in $O(x \times L)$ operations on average and in $O(x \times L^{2})$
operations in the worst case. We compared OSS against four state-of-the-art
seed selection schemes and observed that OSS provides a 3-fold reduction of
average seed frequency over the best previous seed selection optimizations.

We report wetting transitions of condensed droplets occurring spontaneously on
pillared surfaces with two-tier roughness owing to excellent
superhydrophobicity. The phenomenon results from further decreased Laplace
pressure on the top side of the individual droplet when its size becomes
comparable to the scale of the micropillars, which leads to a surprising robust
spontaneous wetting transition, from valleys to tops of the pillars. A simple
scaling law is derived theoretically, which demonstrates that the critical size
of the droplet is determined by the space of the micropillars. For this reason,
highly efficient removal of water benefits greatly from smaller micropillar
space. Furthermore, three wetting transition modes exist, in which the in situ
wetting behaviors are in good agreement with our quantitative theoretical
analysis.

depths between uncoated piles and piles coated with titanium dioxide (TiO2)

superhydrophilic, enabling water molecules to penetrate inside the clay pores.
The attraction suppresses or reduces the compression of water inside the clay
pores. The absence of bulk pressure from water causes the pile not to bounce
(backward movement after striking). Contrary to hydrophobic surfaces, which
tend to repel water molecules, water is compressed into the clay pores
generating a bulk pressure that induces a countering upward force (resulting in
rebounding). Driving tests for two types of clay demonstrate the absence of
bouncing from coated piles. An examination of the pile surfaces indicates the
formation of bonds between water molecules and coated surface and the absence
of such bonding for uncoated piles. This finding might accelerate the process

Moreover, there is a move to use wireless channels in formation control
applications. It has been found in practice that packet losses are more
pronounced in wireless channels, than their wired counterparts. In our
analysis, we first show that packet loss may result in loss of rigidity. In
turn this causes the entire formation to fail. Later, we present an estimation

The proposed estimation algorithm employs minimal spanning tree algorithm to
compute the estimate of the node variables (coordination variables).
Consequently, this reduces the communication overhead required for information

should be approximated by hyperplanes rather than halfspaces. We prove the
linear convergence of this strategy, followed by proving that superlinear and
quadratic convergence can be obtained when the problem is similar to the

the velocities of mobile devices is a key to avoid call drops and improve the
quality of service to the user equipments (UEs). A simple and efficient way to
estimate a UE's velocity is by counting the number of handovers made by the UE
during a predefined time window. Indeed, handover-count based mobility state
detection has been standardized since Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release-8
specifications. The increasing density of small cells in wireless networks can
help in accurate estimation of velocity and mobility state of a UE. In this
paper, we model densely deployed small cells using stochastic geometry, and
then analyze the statistics of the number of handovers as a function of UE
velocity, small-cell density, and handover count measurement time window. Using
these statistics, we derive approximations to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)
for the velocity estimate of a UE. Also, we determine a minimum variance
unbiased (MVU) velocity estimator whose variance tightly matches with the CRLB.
Using this velocity estimator, we formulate the problem of detecting the
mobility state of a UE as low, medium, or high-mobility, as in LTE
specifications. Subsequently, we derive the probability of correctly detecting
the mobility state of a UE. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the velocity
estimator under more realistic scenarios such as clustered deployment of small
cells, random way point (RWP) mobility model for UEs, and variable UE velocity.
Our analysis shows that the accuracy of velocity estimation and mobility state
detection increases with increasing small cell density and with increasing
handover count measurement time window.

beam-displacement prism as the analyzer. The ordinary and extra-ordinary
emerging beams in each spectral band are quasi-simultaneously detected by the

chopping frequency can be set to as high as 200 Hz. A rotating superachromatic
Pancharatnam halfwave plate is used to modulate the light incident on the

filters. A detailed analysis shows that the reduction of 50% in the efficiency
of the polarimeter because of the fact that the intensities of the two beams
are measured alternately is partly compensated by the reduced time to be spent
on the observation of the sky background. The position angle of polarization
produced by the Glan-Taylor prism in the light path is found to be slightly
wavelength dependent, indicating that the fixed super-achromatic halfwave plate
in the beam does not fully compensate for the variation in the position angle
of the effective optical axis of the rotating plate. However, the total
amplitude of variation in the U-I spectral region is only 0.92 degree. The
polarization efficiency is also found to be wavelength-dependent with a total
amplitude of 0.271% in the U-I region; its mean value is 99.211%. The
instrumental polarization is found to be very low. It is nearly constant in the
V-I spectral region (~0.04%), and apparently, it increases slightly towards the
ultraviolet. The observations of polarized stars show that the agreement
between the measured polarization values and those available in the literature

to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) solves the strong CP
problem and also modifies the dark sector with new dark matter candidates.
While SUSY axion phenomenology is usually restricted to searches for the axion
itself or searches for the ordinary SUSY particles, this work focuses on
scenarios where the axion's superpartner, the axino may be detectable at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the decays of neutralinos displaced from the
primary vertex. In particular this work focuses on the KSVZ axino. The decay
length of neutralinos in this scenario easily fits the ATLAS detector for SUSY
spectra expected to be testable at the 14 TeV LHC. This signature of displaced
decays to axinos is compared to other well motivated scenarios containing a
long lived neutralino which decays inside the detector. These alternative
scenarios can in some cases very closely mimic the expected axino signature,
and the degree to which they are distinguishable is discussed. The cosmological

driving the need for adaptive workflows, where the composition and execution of
computational and data manipulation steps dynamically depend on the
evolutionary state of the simulation itself. Consider for example, the
frequency of data storage. Critical phases of the simulation should be captured
with high frequency and with high fidelity for post-analysis, however we cannot
afford to retain the same frequency for the full simulation due to the high
cost of data movement. We can instead look for triggers, indicators that the
simulation will be entering a critical phase and adapt the workflow
accordingly.
  We present a method for detecting triggers and demonstrate its use in direct
numerical simulations of turbulent combustion using S3D. We show that chemical
explosive mode analysis (CEMA) can be used to devise a noise-tolerant indicator
for rapid increase in heat release. However, exhaustive computation of CEMA
values dominates the total simulation, thus is prohibitively expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose a quantile-sampling approach. Our
algorithm comes with provable error/confidence bounds, as a function of the
number of samples. Most importantly, the number of samples is independent of
the problem size, thus our proposed algorithm offers perfect scalability. Our
experiments on homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) and reactivity
controlled compression ignition (RCCI) simulations show that the proposed
method can detect rapid increases in heat release, and its computational
overhead is negligible. Our results will be used for dynamic workflow decisions
about data storage and mesh resolution in future combustion simulations.
Proposed framework is generalizable and we detail how it could be applied to a
broad class of scientific simulation workflows.

discovered in the early 19th century by Brewster, among others, while studying
light reflected from materials at different angles. These studies led to the
first polarizers, based on Brewster's effect. One of the most active trends in
photonics now is devoted to the study of miniaturized, sub-wavelength devices
exhibiting similar, or even improved, functionalities compared to those
achieved with bulk optical elements. In the present work, it is theoretically
predicted that a properly designed all-dielectric metasurface exhibits a
generalized Brewster effect potentially for any angle, wavelength and
polarization of choice. The effect is experimentally demonstrated for an array
of silicon nanodisks at visible wavelengths. The underlying physics of this
effect can be understood in terms of the suppressed scattering at certain
angles that results from the interference between the electric and magnetic
dipole resonances excited in the nanoparticles, predicted by Kerker in early
80s. This reveals deep connection of Kerker's and Brewster's legacies and opens
doors for Brewster phenomenon to new applications in photonics, which are not
bonded to a specific polarization or angle of incidence.

(hereafter BAO1) and the BAO data obtained by using the anisotropic
two-dimensional GC statistics (hereafter BAO2). To make a comparison, we also
take into account the case without BAO data (hereafter NO BAO). Firstly, making
use of these BAO data, as well as the SNLS3 type Ia supernovae sample and the
Planck distance priors data, we give the cosmological constraints of the
$\Lambda$CDM, the $w$CDM, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model. Then,
we discuss the impacts of different BAO data on cosmological consquences,
including its effects on parameter space, equation of state (EoS), figure of
merit (FoM), deceleration-acceleration transition redshift, Hubble parameter
$H(z)$, deceleration parameter $q(z)$, statefinder hierarchy $S^{(1)}_3(z)$,
$S^{(1)}_4(z)$ and cosmic age $t(z)$. We find that: (1) NO BAO data always give
a smallest fractional matter density $\Omega_{m0}$, a largest fractional
curvature density $\Omega_{k0}$ and a largest Hubble constant $h$; in contrast,
BAO1 data always give a largest $\Omega_{m0}$, a smallest $\Omega_{k0}$ and a
smallest $h$. (2) For the $w$CDM and the CPL model, NO BAO data always give a
largest EoS $w$; in contrast, BAO2 data always give a smallest $w$. (3)
Compared with the case of BAO1, BAO2 data always give a slightly larger FoM,
and thus can give a cosmological constraint with a slightly better accuracy.
(4) The impacts of different BAO data on the cosmic evolution and the comic age
are very small, and can not be distinguished by using various dark energy
diagnosis and the cosmic age data.

corresponds to carter constant. From the properties of the imaginary part of

unification by providing extra spin-0 partners for the spin-1 W$^\pm$ and Z. It
offers the possibility to view, up to a mixing angle, the new 125 GeV boson as
the spin-0 partner of the Z under two supersymmetry transformations, i.e. as a
Z that would be deprived of its spin. Supersymmetry then relates two existing
particles of different spins, in spite of their different gauge symmetry
properties, through supersymmetry transformations acting on physical fields in
a non-polynomial way.

enhancement is possible. In this paper we propose a physical mechanism for
locomotion enhancement of microscopic swimmers in a complex fluid. It is based
on the fact that micro-structured fluids will generically phase-separate near
surfaces, leading to the presence of low-viscosity layers which promote slip
and decrease viscous friction near the surface of the swimmer. We use two
models to address the consequence of this phase separation: a nonzero apparent
slip length for the fluid and then an explicit modeling of the change of
viscosity in a thin layer near the swimmer. Considering two canonical setups
for low-Reynolds number locomotion, namely the waving locomotion of a
two-dimensional sheet and that of a three-dimensional filament, we show that
phase-separation systematically increases the locomotion speeds, possibly by
orders of magnitude. We close by confronting our predictions with recent
experimental results.

in abelian group extensions. The main result can be stated as follows: Let
$0\to N\to G\to Q \to 1$ be an abelian group extension. Then one has the
following exact sequence of groups: $$0\to End^{N,Q}(G)\to End^Q_N(G)\to
End_Q(N)\to H^2(Q,N)\to H^2(G,N)$$ where $End^{N,Q}(G)$ denotes the set of all
endomorphisms of $G$ which centralise $N$ and induce identity on $Q$,
$End^Q_N(G)$ denotes the set of all endomorphisms of $G$ which normalise $N$

$N$ which are compatible with the action of $Q$ on $N$. This exact sequence is
obtained using the five-term exact sequence in group cohomology.
  An interesting fact we discovered is that the first three terms involved have
ring structure and the maps between them are ring homomorphisms. The ring
structure on $End_Q(N)$ is well-known, however the ring structure of the second
term is a little more exotic. Restricted on quasi-regular elements, this gives
the exact sequence proved recently in \cite{passi} by Passi, Singh and Yadav.

through symbols from modulation alphabets defined in the complex plane (e.g.,

modulation (IM), additional information bits are conveyed through indices of
certain transmit entities that get involved in the transmission. Transmit
antennas in multi-antenna systems and subcarriers in multi-carrier systems are
examples of such transmit entities that can be used to convey additional
information bits through indexing. In this paper, we introduce {\em generalized
space and frequency index modulation}, where the indices of active transmit
antennas and subcarriers convey information bits. We first introduce index
modulation in the spatial domain, referred to as generalized spatial index
modulation (GSIM). For GSIM, where bits are indexed only in the spatial domain,
we derive the expression for achievable rate as well as easy-to-compute upper
and lower bounds on this rate. We show that the achievable rate in GSIM can be
more than that in spatial multiplexing, and analytically establish the
condition under which this can happen. It is noted that GSIM achieves this
higher rate using fewer transmit radio frequency (RF) chains compared to
spatial multiplexing. We also propose a Gibbs sampling based detection
algorithm for GSIM and show that GSIM can achieve better bit error rate (BER)
performance than spatial multiplexing. For generalized space-frequency index
modulation (GSFIM), where bits are encoded through indexing in both active
antennas as well as subcarriers, we derive the achievable rate expression.
Numerical results show that GSFIM can achieve higher rates compared to
conventional MIMO-OFDM. Also, BER results show the potential for GSFIM
performing better than MIMO-OFDM.

in quantum information technology since it plays a crucial role in preserving
quantum memory. Albeit in many realistic scenarios the quantum system can
simultaneously interact with composite environments, this condition remains
little understood, particularly regarding the effect of the coupling between
environmental parts. We analyze the non-Markovian behavior of a qubit
interacting at the same time with two coupled single-mode cavities which in
turn dissipate into memoryless or memory-keeping reservoirs. We show that
increasing the control parameter, that is the two-mode coupling, allows for
triggering and enhancing a non-Markovian dynamics for the qubit starting from a
Markovian one in absence of coupling. Surprisingly, if the qubit dynamics is
non-Markovian for zero control parameter, increasing the latter enables
multiple transitions from non-Markovian to Markovian regimes. These results
hold independently on the nature of the reservoirs. This work highlights that
suitably engineering the coupling between parts of a compound environment can
efficiently harness the quantum memory, stored in a qubit, based on
non-Markovianity.

derived, avoiding any linear response or other approximations. The resulting
theorem for the dynamics of observables, valid to all orders in external
fields, is found to contain generalized Berry curvature type of quantities that
incorporate the dynamics through explicit and nontrivial time-dependence; these
Berry quantities resemble the so called anomalous terms (in semiclassical
equations of motion in solids) but are both of magnetic and electric type, the
former being associated with Quantum Hall Effect type of behaviors and the
latter with Polarization type of behaviors. By way of application of the new
theorem, the quantum equations of motion of a spinless and a spinfull electron
in a solid are derived without any adiabatic or semiclassical approximation.
The charge current formula for a many-body and interacting spinfull system is
also derived and is found to consist of a longitudinal and a transverse part;
phenomenological interpretations with respect to polarization and magnetization
currents respectively then emerge in a natural way. In addition, a formula for
the topological magnetoelectric effect for an interacting spinfull electron
system is also provided. By carefully defining singlevaluedness in parameter
space, in a nonstandard fashion and in higher rigor than usual, we are able to
discuss in clarity the issue of possible obstruction of this singlevaluedness,
the associated creation of Berry monopoles in parameter space and the
quantization of the flux of Berry curvature (but with nontrivial dynamics

cylindrically symmetric spacetime in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity [1], where
$f(R,T)$ is an arbitrary function of Ricci scalar $R$ and trace of the energy
momentum tensor $T$. We explore the exact solutions for two different classes
of $f(R,T)$ models. The first class $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ yields a solution which
corresponds to an exterior metric of cosmic string while the second class
$f(R,T)=f_1(R)+f_2(T)$ provides an additional solution representing a non-null
electromagnetic field. The energy densities and corresponding functions for
$f(R,T)$ models are evaluated in each case.

be interpreted as a quantum random walk in momentum space. We show how to steer
such a random walk by applying a random sequence of intensities and phases of
the kicking lattice chosen according to a probability distribution. This
distribution converts on average into the final momentum distribution of the
kicked atoms. In particular, it is shown that a power-law distribution for the
kicking strengths results in a L\'evy walk in momentum space and in a power-law
with the same exponent in the averaged momentum distribution. Furthermore, we
investigate the stability of our predictions in the context of a realistic
experiment with Bose-Einstein condensates.

of multidimensional discrete sequences in terms of the shapes of their
trajectories in the extended space of states. This approach is based on the
study of the structural properties of sequences and is suitable for estimating
the complexity of both chaotic and stochastic sequences. It is constructed on
the method, proposed earlier by the author, of symbolic CTQ-analysis of
multidimensional discrete sequences and mappings. The algorithm proposed
manipulates not only the frequency of occurrence of symbols, but also takes
into account their sequence order. An example (financial time series) is given
that demonstrates the application of the tools developed.

mimic physical effects of modified gravitational theories of $f(R,T,R_{\mu

solutions are constructed in the review, which encode certain models of
covariant Ho\v{r}ava type gravity with dynamical Lorentz symmetry breaking. The
corresponding FLRW cosmological dynamics with possible nonholonomic
deformations and the reconstruction procedure of certain actions closely
related with the standard $\Lambda$CDM universe are studied. Off-diagonal
generalizations of de Sitter universes are constructed which are generated
through nonlinear gravitational polarization of fundamental physical constants
and which model interactions with non-constant exotic fluids and effective
matter. The problem of possible matter instability for such off-diagonal
deformations in (modified) gravity theories is briefly discussed.

TTS systems on Android are available for many languages but a very few systems
of this type are available for Punjabi language. Our research work had the aim
to develop an application that will be able to produce synthetic Punjabi
speech. The paper examines the methodology used to develop speech synthesis TTS
system for the Punjabi content, which is written in Gurmukhi script. For the
development of this system, we use concatenative speech synthesis method with
phonemes as the basic units of concatenation. Some challenges like application
size, processing time, must be considered, while porting this TTS system to
resource-limited devices like mobile phones.
