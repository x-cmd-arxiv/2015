constant $0 < c_0 \ll 1$, independent of $\textbf{Re}$, such that sufficiently
regular disturbances of size $\epsilon \lesssim \textbf{Re}^{-2/3-\delta}$ for
any $\delta > 0$ exist at least until $t = c_0\epsilon^{-1}$ and in general
evolve to be $O(c_0)$ due to the lift-up effect. Further, after times $t
\gtrsim \textbf{Re}^{1/3}$, the streamwise dependence of the solution is
rapidly diminished by a mixing-enhanced dissipation effect and the solution is
attracted back to the class of ""2.5 dimensional"" streamwise-independent
solutions (sometimes referred to as ""streaks""). The largest of these streaks
are expected to eventually undergo a secondary instability at $t \approx
\epsilon^{-1}$. Hence, our work strongly suggests, for all (sufficiently
regular) initial data, the genericity of the ""lift-up effect $\Rightarrow$
streak growth $\Rightarrow$ streak breakdown"" scenario for turbulent transition
of the 3D Couette flow near the threshold of stability forwarded in the applied

with an optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees; (ii) in the regime where
degrees are scaled by $\omega(1)$ (diverging degrees), this is enhanced into a
fully agnostic algorithm that only takes the graph in question and
simultaneously learns the model parameters (including the number of
communities) and detects communities with accuracy $1-o(1)$, with an overall
quasi-linear complexity; (iii) in the logarithmic degree regime, an agnostic
algorithm is developed that learns the parameters and achieves the optimal
CH-limit for exact recovery, in quasi-linear time. These provide the first
algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic

radiate in free space, the magnetic current augments the electric current, so
that the fields interior to the surface vanish. In contrast to approaches based

are based on resonance effects and active tuning of the amplitude and
wavelength response is often essential. Plasmonic nanostructures are an
efficient way to create optical resonances, a prominent example is the
extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through arrays of nanoholes patterned
in a metallic film. Tuning of resonances by heating, applying electrical or
optical signals has proven to be more elusive, due to the lack of materials
that can induce modulation over a broad spectral range and/or at high speeds.
Here we show that nanopatterned metals combined with phase change materials
(PCMs) can overcome this limitation due to the large change in optical
constants which can be induced thermally or on an ultrafast timescale. We
demonstrate resonance wavelength shifts as large as 385 nm - an order of
magnitude higher than previously reported - by combining properly designed Au
EOT nanostructures with Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). Moreover, we show, through pump probe
measurements, repeatable and reversible, large amplitude modulations in the
resonances, especially at telecommunication wavelengths, over ps time scales
and at powers far below those needed to produce a permanent phase transition.
Our findings open a pathway to the design of hybrid metal PCM nanostructures
with ultrafast and widely tuneable resonance responses, which hold potential
impact on active nanophotonic devices such as tuneable optical filters, smart
windows, biosensors and reconfigurable memories.

[11] for the Riemann zeta-function to other $L$-functions in the Selberg class.
Our approach is based on the statistics of the zeros because the analogue of
the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for the auto-correlation of the arithmetic
functions we consider is not available in general. One of our main findings is
that the variances of sums of these arithmetic functions over primes in short
intervals have a different form when the degree of the associated $L$-functions
is 2 or higher to that which holds when the degree is 1 (e.g. the Riemann
zeta-function). Specifically, when the degree is 2 or higher there are two
regimes in which the variances take qualitatively different forms, whilst in
the degree-1 case there is a single regime.

modulation matrix of GFDM, which are described in this work. This SINR is used
to evaluate the BER performance. Precoding schemes are proposed to reduce
complexity of GFDM-MMSE receiver without compromising on the performance. Block
Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (BIDFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

are crucial in biotechnology: the ability to control specific interactions is
essential in fields like biomaterials, biomedical implants and biosensors. In
the latter case, biosensor sensitivity hinges on ligand proteins adsorbing on
bioactive surfaces with a favorable orientation, exposing reaction sites to
target molecules. Protein adsorption, being a free-energy-driven process, is
difficult to study experimentally. This paper develops and evaluates a
computational model to study electrostatic interactions of proteins and charged
nanosurfaces, via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We extended the
implicit-solvent model used in the open-source code PyGBe to include surfaces
of imposed charge or potential. This code solves the boundary integral
formulation of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, discretized with surface
elements. PyGBe has at its core a treecode-accelerated Krylov iterative solver,
resulting in O(N log N) scaling, with further acceleration on hardware via
multi-threaded execution on \gpu s. It computes solvation and surface free
energies, providing a framework for studying the effect of electrostatics on
adsorption. We then derived an analytical solution for a spherical charged
surface interacting with a spherical molecule, then completed a
grid-convergence study to build evidence on the correctness of our approach.
The study showed the error decaying with the average area of the boundary
elements, i.e., the method is O(1/N), which is consistent with our previous
verification studies using PyGBe. We also studied grid-convergence using a real
molecular geometry (protein GB1D4'), in this case using Richardson
extrapolation (in the absence of an analytical solution) and confirmed the
O(1/N) scaling in this case.

during their migration in a protoplanetary disk. We use an analytical model of
resonances, and describe the effect of the disk by a migration timescale
(T_{m,i}) and an eccentricity damping timescale (T_{e,i}) for each planet
(i=1,2 respectively for the inner and outer planet). We show that the resonant
configuration is stable if T_{e,1}/T_{e,2} > (e_1/e_2)^2. This general result
can be used to put constraints on specific models of disk-planet interactions.
For instance, using classical prescriptions for type I migration, we show that
when the angular momentum deficit (AMD) of the inner orbit is larger than the
outer's orbit AMD, resonant systems must have a locally inverted disk density
profile to stay locked in resonance during the migration. This inversion is
very untypical of type I migration and our criterion can thus provide an
evidence against classical type I migration. That is indeed the case for the
Jupiter-mass resonant systems HD 60532b, c (3:1 MMR), GJ 876b, c (2:1 MMR), and
HD 45364b, c (3:2 MMR). This result may be an evidence for type II migration

technivector mesons (technirhos, denoted as $\rho_\Pi^{\pm,3}$) of the walking
technicolor in the case of the one-family model as a benchmark. As the
effective theory for the walking technicolor at the scales relevant to the LHC
experiment, we take a scale-invariant version of the hidden local symmetry
model so constructed as to accommodate technipions, technivector mesons, and
the technidilaton in such a way that the model respects spontaneously broken
chiral and scale symmetries of the underlying walking technicolor. In
particular, the technidilaton, a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson of the
(approximate) scale symmetry predicted in the walking technicolor, has been
shown to be successfully identified with the 125 GeV Higgs. Currently available
LHC limits on those technihadrons are used to fix the couplings of technivector
mesons to the standard-model fermions and weak gauge bosons. We find that the
technirho's are mainly produced through the Drell-Yan process and predominantly
decay to the dibosons, which accounts for the currently reported excess at

regular, the response to small perturbations is linearly small. However, a
crucial ingredient is absent of the theory, namely transactions themselves.
What happens after they occur? To answer the question, we develop a dynamic
theory for supply and demand based on agents with heterogeneous beliefs. When
the inter-auction time is infinitely long, the Walrasian mechanism is
recovered. When transactions are allowed to happen in continuous time, a
peculiar property emerges: close to the price, supply and demand vanish
quadratically, which we empirically confirm on the Bitcoin. This explains why
price impact in financial markets is universally observed to behave as the
square root of the excess volume. The consequences are important, as they imply
that the very fact of clearing the market makes prices hypersensitive to small

Nowadays the van der Corput sequence, as it was named later, is the prototype
of many uniformly distributed sequences, also in the multi-dimensional case.
Such sequences are required as sample nodes in quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms,
which are deterministic variants of Monte Carlo rules for numerical

of convolutions in deep learning. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its
advantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a
powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural
networks (CNNs).
  We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to
CNN design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality
reduction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This
approach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other
pooling strategies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output
dimensionality. This representation also enables a new form of stochastic
regularization by randomized modification of resolution. We show that these
methods achieve competitive results on classification and approximation tasks,
without using any dropout or max-pooling.
  Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral
parameterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying
model unchanged, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates
optimization. We observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this
leads to significantly faster convergence during training.

the little-hierarchy problem, there is no cause for doubting naturalness or
natural theories. Naturalness is grounded in Bayesian probability logic - it is
not a scientific theory and it makes no sense to claim that it could be
falsified or that it is under pressure from experimental data. We should remain
optimistic about discovery prospects; natural theories, such as supersymmetry,
generally predict new physics close to the weak scale. Furthermore, from a
Bayesian perspective, we briefly discuss 't Hooft's technical naturalness and a
contentious claim that the little-hierarchy problem hints that the Standard

composed of a subdwarf B (sdB) star ($g'=17.2^m$) with a faint companion.
Subdwarf B stars are core helium-burning stars, which can be found on the
extreme horizontal branch. About half of them reside in close binary systems,
but few are known to be eclipsing, for which fundamental stellar parameters can
be derived.\newline We conducted an analysis of photometric data and spectra
from the Palomar 60'' and the 200"" Hale telescope respectively. A quantitative
spectral analysis found an effective temperature of
$T_{\text{eff}}=33900\pm350$\,K, log g = $5.74\pm0.08$ and
log($n_{\text{He}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -2.02 \pm0.07$, typical for an sdB star. The
companion does not contribute to the optical light of the system, except
through a distinct reflection effect. From the light curve an orbital period of
0.09980(25)\,d and a system inclination of $83.56\pm0.30\,^{\circ}$ were
derived. The radial velocity curve yielded an orbital semi-amplitude of
$K_1=95.8\pm 8.1\,\text{km s$^{-1}$}$. The mass for the M-type dwarf companion
is $0.155\pm0.020\,M_{\odot}$. PTF1\,J072456$+$125301 has similar atmospheric
parameters to those of pulsating sdB stars (V346 Hya stars). Therefore it could
be a high-priority object for asteroseismology, if pulsations were detected
such as in the enigmatic case of NY Vir.

distance, motion, change, flow of time, matter. The field of cognitive science
argues that the abstract concepts of mathematics are not Platonic, but are
built in the brain from these primordial perceptions, using what are known as
conceptual metaphors. Known cognitive mechanisms give rise to the extremely
precise and logical language of mathematics. Thus all of the vastness of
mathematics, with its beautiful theorems, is human mathematics. It resides in
the mind, and is not `out there'. Physics is an experimental science in which
results of experiments are described in terms of concrete concepts - these
concepts are also built from our primordial perceptions. The goal of
theoretical physics is to describe the experimentally observed regularity of
the physical world in an unambiguous, precise and logical manner. To do so, the
brain resorts to the well-defined abstract concepts which the mind has
metaphored from our primordial perceptions. Since both the concrete and the
abstract are derived from the primordial, the connection between physics and
mathematics is not mysterious, but natural. This connection is established in
the human brain, where a small subset of the vast human mathematics is
cognitively fitted to describe the regularity of the universe. Theoretical
physics should be thought of as a branch of mathematics, whose axioms are
motivated by observations of the physical world. We use the example of quantum
theory to demonstrate the all too human nature of the physics-mathematics
connection: it is at times frail, and imperfect. Our resistance to take this
imperfection sufficiently seriously [since no known experiment violates quantum
theory] shows the fundamental importance of experiments in physics.

these effects on the structure formation for different particle energies and we
find that the formation of structure is more complex than originally assumed, a
combination of top-down collapse and hierarchical (bottom-up) clustering on
multiple scales. The degree on which one scenario is more prominent with
respect to the other depends globally on the energy of the particle and locally
on the morphology and architecture of the analyzed region. The presence of
shells and caustics in warm dark matter halos is another important effect seen
in simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of thermal velocities on the
structure formation from theoretical considerations as well as from the
analysis of the simulations. We re-examine the assumptions considered when
estimating the velocity dispersion for warm dark matter particles that have
been adopted in previous works for more than a decade and we give an
independent estimation for the velocities. We identify some inconsistencies in
previous published results. The relation between the warm dark matter particle
mass and its corresponding velocity dispersion is strongly model dependent,
hence the constraints on particle mass from simulation results are weak.
Finally, we review the technical difficulties that arise in warm dark matter

DD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated
core containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme
temperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As
an application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times
10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated
size of some giant exoplanets (""hot Jupiters"") may be linked to screened DD
fusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution
model suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important
if there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective
extra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD
fusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with
the trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\rm
eq}$, and also depends on planetary mass. Although we do not consider the
effect of incident stellar flux, we expect that a minimum level of irradiation
is necessary to trigger core erosion and subsequent DD fusion inside the
planet. Since DD fusion is quite sensitive to the screening potential inferred
from laboratory experiments, observations of inflated hot Jupiters may help
constrain screening effects in the cores of giant planets.

studying an infinite-length cylinder propagating lateral or spiral displacement

finite-length filament decreases as its length decreases and planar bending
induces an angular velocity that increases linearly with added resistance. The

this global index represents well the bulk of the SNR. At the SE, we found a
pattern of parallel strips with a flat spectrum compatible with small-scale

with the idea that the SN shock front is interacting with an external cloud.

the five previously known field sources, two of which are found to be double

state-of-the-art predictive performance, but high-quality uncertainty estimates

scaling GPs to large-scale data sets comes at the cost of approximating the
uncertainty estimates. We extend Mondrian forests, first proposed by
Lakshminarayanan et al. (2014) for classification problems, to the large-scale
non-parametric regression setting. Using a novel hierarchical Gaussian prior
that dovetails with the Mondrian forest framework, we obtain principled
uncertainty estimates, while still retaining the computational advantages of
decision forests. Through a combination of illustrative examples, real-world
large-scale datasets, and Bayesian optimization benchmarks, we demonstrate that
Mondrian forests outperform approximate GPs on large-scale regression tasks and
deliver better-calibrated uncertainty assessments than decision-forest-based
methods.

fully filled bands, they are sometimes also described in terms of a
complementary Wannier picture in which electrons occupy localized, atom-like
orbitals. Under what conditions does the latter picture break down? The
presence of irremovable quantum entanglement between different sites can
obstruct a localized orbital description, which occurs in systems like Chern
and topological insulators. We collectively refer to such states as Quantum
Band Insulators (QBIs). Here we report the theoretical discovery of a
filling-enforced QBI - that is, a free electron insulator in which the band
filling is smaller than the minimum number dictated by the atomic picture.
Consequently such insulators have no representation in terms of filling
localized orbitals and must be QBIs. This is shown to occur in models of
certain cubic crystals with non-symmorphic space groups. Like topological
insulators, filling-enforced QBIs require spin-orbit coupling. However, in
contrast, they do not typically exhibit protected surface states. Instead their
nontrivial nature is revealed by studying the quantum entanglement of their
ground state wavefunction.

redshift (0.35<z<0.55), we find a higher normalisation, which points at a
fractional increase of the richness towards lower redshift caused by the
build-up of the red-sequence. The miscentring distribution is well constrained.
Only ~30% of our BCGs coincide with the peak of the dark matter distribution.
The distribution of the remaining BCGs are modelled with a 2D-Gaussian, whose

results at low redshift, but have a higher normalisation at higher redshifts,
which may be due to selection and projection effects. The concentration of the
satellite distribution decreases with mass and is correlated with the
concentration of the halo.

This method allow us to derive the deviations of the kinematic PAs from a

objects show morpho-kinematic PA misalignments that cannot be found in the
control sample. Those misalignments are present mostly in galaxies with
morphological signatures of interaction. Alignment between the kinematic sides
for both samples is similar, with most of the galaxies displaying small
misalignments. Radial deviations of the kinematic PA from a straight line in
the stellar component measured by $\delta$PA$_{\mathrm{kin}}$ are large for
both samples. However, for a large fraction of interacting galaxies the ionized
gas $\delta$PA$_{\mathrm{kin}}$ is larger than typical values derived from
isolated galaxies (48%), making this parameter a good indicator to trace the
impact of interaction and mergers in the internal motions of galaxies. By
comparing the stellar and ionized gas kinematic PA, we find that 42% (28/66) of
the interacting galaxies have misalignments larger than 16 degrees, compared to
10% from the control sample. Our results show the impact of interactions in the

possible degeneracies from the properties of the underlying stellar
populations. Both B and Rv correlate with galactocentric distance, revealing a
systematic trend of the dust properties. Our results confirm previous findings
that dust in M82 is better fit by a Milky Way standard extinction curve (Hutton
et al.), in contrast to a Calzetti law. We find a strong correlation between Rv
and B, towards a stronger NUV bump in regions with higher Rv, possibly
reflecting a distribution with larger dust grain sizes. The data we use were
taken before SN2014J, and therefore can be used to probe the properties of the
interstellar medium before the event. Our Rv values around the position of the
supernova are significantly higher than recent measurements post-SN2014J
(Rv~1.4). This result is consistent with a significant change in the dust
properties after the supernova event, either from disruption of large grains or
from the contribution by an intrinsic circumstellar component. Intrinsic
variations among supernovae not accounted for could also give rise to this
mismatch.

especially concerning adiabatic subtraction terms. The subtraction terms for
minimally coupled slow-roll inflation are well known. We extend the view to
more generic inflation models, and derive the subtraction terms for k-inflation

of the subtraction term at late times. We also consider the non-minimally

photometric redshifts, close to $1\%$, and the wide spread of the seven
ALHAMBRA pointings ensure that this catalogue has better mass sensitivity and
is less affected by cosmic variance than comparable samples.
  The detection has been carried out with the Bayesian Cluster Finder (BCF),
whose performance has been checked in ALHAMBRA-like light-cone mock catalogues.
Great care has been taken to ensure that the observable properties of the mocks
photometry accurately correspond to those of real catalogues. From our
simulations, we expect to detect galaxy clusters and groups with both $70\%$
completeness and purity down to dark matter halo masses of
$M_h\sim3\times10^{13}\rm M_{\odot}$ for $z<0.85$. Cluster redshifts are
expected to be recovered with $\sim0.6\%$ precision for $z<1$. We also expect
to measure cluster masses with $\sigma_{M_h|M^*_{CL}}\sim0.25-0.35\, dex$
precision down to $\sim3\times10^{13}\rm M_{\odot}$, masses which are $50\%$
smaller than those reached by similar work.
  We have compared these detections with previous optical, spectroscopic and
X-rays work, finding an excellent agreement with the rates reported from the
simulations. We have also explored the overall properties of these detections
such as the presence of a colour-magnitude relation, the evolution of the
photometric blue fraction and the clustering of these sources in the different
ALHAMBRA fields. Despite the small numbers, we observe tentative evidence that,
for a fixed stellar mass, the environment is playing a crucial role at lower
redshifts (z$<$0.5).

current experimental sensistivity where the underlying theory is weakly coupled
and renormalizable, with neutral mediators: either scalars or fermions. An
interesting scenario resulting from this categorization is the neutrino portal,
where only fermion mediators are present, and where the dark sector consists of
fermions and scalars such that the lightest dark particle is a fermion, this
scenario is characterized by having naturally suppressed couplings of the DM to
all SM particles except the neutrinos and has received little attention in the
literature. We find that there is a wide region in parameter space allowed by
the current experimental constraints (relic abundance, direct and indirect
detection limits); the cleanest signature of this paradigm is the presence of
monochromatic neutrino lines with energy equal to that of the DM mass, but
experimental sensitivity would have to be improved significantly before this
can be probed.

are computed holographically: the ground-state energy density, the string
tension, the 't Hooft loop, the light scalar glueball mass, the baryon mass
scale, the critical temperature for deconfinement - and thus the whole (T,

the model. Some of the observables we consider can and have been in fact
studied in pure 4d Yang-Mills on the lattice. In that framework the results,
obtained in the small theta regime, are given up to very few powers of theta^2.
The corresponding holographic results agree qualitatively with available
lattice data and signal an overall mass scale reduction by theta. Moreover,
being exact in theta, they provide a benchmark for higher order corrections in
Yang-Mills.

visualizing, sharing, and using intangible resources of an organization and its

successful implementation of KM programs, and the evaluation of such factors is
considered a strategic tool for Public Organizations (POs) for efficiently
directing the implementation of a KM program. Nevertheless, there are cultural
problems such as weak trust, bad collaboration; technological problems as KM
systems difficult to use, nor interconnected or interoperable; and strategic
problems as political changes, not inter-administration continuity or lack of
political willingness. In this research we provide an overview of the key
factors for facilitating the implementation of KM programs. To this end, we
conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of success factors to create a
KM program for POs. Analyzing the twenty related studies we summarize benefits
and quality attributes of KM. Moreover, we obtained from an ongoing project
evaluation results of the KM factors ranked cultural, technological and
strategic. The results show that the Mexican POs have strategic and
technological issues such as: a misalignment between knowledge management and
organizational goals, it seems that POs are barely reusing their knowledge to
execute their daily activities or to take decisions, and is not possible to
know who and how a knowledge asset has been used. Finally, according to the
gaps and difficulties of the SLR, we provide strategies to successfully
implement KM programs in Mexico.

the Mach number and the standard deviation of the logarithmic density with
$\mathrm{b} = 0.457 \pm 0.007$. The density spectra follow
$\mathcal{D}(k,\,\mathcal{M}) \propto k^{\zeta(\mathcal{M})}$ with scaling
exponents depending on the Mach number. We find $\zeta(\mathcal{M}) = \alpha
\mathcal{M}^{\beta}$ with a coefficient $\alpha$ that varies slightly with
resolution, whereas $\beta$ changes systematically. We extrapolate to the limit
of infinite resolution and find $\alpha = -1.91 \pm 0.01,\, \beta =-0.30\pm
0.03$. The dependence of the scaling exponent on the Mach number implies a
fractal dimension $D=2+0.96 \mathcal{M}^{-0.30}$. We determine how the scaling
parameters depend on the wavenumber and find that the density spectra are
slightly curved. This curvature gets more pronounced with increasing Mach
number. We propose a physically motivated fitting formula $\mathcal{D}(k) =
\mathcal{D}_0 k^{\zeta k^{\eta}}$ by using simple scaling arguments. The fit
reproduces the spectral behaviour down to scales $k\approx 80$. The density
spectrum follows a single power-law $\eta = -0.005 \pm 0.01$ in the low Mach
number regime and the strongest curvature $\eta = -0.04 \pm 0.02$ for the

(RTB) mimics stock spot exchanges and utilises computers to algorithmically buy
display ads per impression via a real-time auction. Despite the new automation,
the ad markets are still informationally inefficient due to the heavily
fragmented marketplaces. Two display impressions with similar or identical
effectiveness (e.g., measured by conversion or click-through rates for a
targeted audience) may sell for quite different prices at different market
segments or pricing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining
paradigm called Statistical Arbitrage Mining (SAM) focusing on mining and
exploiting price discrepancies between two pricing schemes. In essence, our
SAMer is a meta-bidder that hedges advertisers' risk between CPA (cost per
action)-based campaigns and CPM (cost per mille impressions)-based ad
inventories; it statistically assesses the potential profit and cost for an
incoming CPM bid request against a portfolio of CPA campaigns based on the
estimated conversion rate, bid landscape and other statistics learned from
historical data. In SAM, (i) functional optimisation is utilised to seek for
optimal bidding to maximise the expected arbitrage net profit, and (ii) a
portfolio-based risk management solution is leveraged to reallocate bid volume
and budget across the set of campaigns to make a risk and return trade-off. We
propose to jointly optimise both components in an EM fashion with high
efficiency to help the meta-bidder successfully catch the transient statistical
arbitrage opportunities in RTB. Both the offline experiments on a real-world
large-scale dataset and online A/B tests on a commercial platform demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed solution in exploiting arbitrage in various

theories with random potentials. Examples of such theories include condensed
matter systems with quenched disorder (e.g. spin glass) or cosmological systems
in context of the string theory landscape (e.g. cosmic inflation). We use the
so-called replica trick to define two different generating functionals for
calculating correlators of the quantum fields averaged over a given
distribution of random potentials. The first generating functional is
appropriate for calculating averaged (in-out) amplitudes and involves a single
replica of fields, but the replica limit is taken to an (unphysical) negative
one number of fields outside of the path integral. When the number of replicas
is doubled the generating functional can also be used for calculating averaged
probabilities (squared amplitudes) using the in-in construction. The second
generating functional involves an infinite number of replicas, but can be used
for calculating both in-out and in-in correlators and the replica limits are
taken to only a zero number of fields. We discuss the formalism in details for
a single real scalar field, but the generalization to more fields or to
different types of fields is straightforward. We work out three examples: one
where the mass of scalar field is treated as a random variable and two where
the functional form of interactions is random, one described by a Gaussian
random field and the other by a Euclidean action in the field configuration
space.

twice the size of Earth, of which 419 are hosted by M dwarf stars and 137 are

detected around stars that are not among the pre-selected target stars, because
TESS will also deliver full-frame images at a 30-minute cadence. The planet
detections are accompanied by over one thousand astrophysical false positives.
We discuss how TESS data and ground-based observations can be used to
distinguish the false positives from genuine planets. We also discuss the
prospects for follow-up observations to measure the masses and atmospheres of
the TESS planets.

crust out of thermal equilibrium with the core. When accretion halts, the crust
cools to its long-term equilibrium temperature on observable timescales. Here
we examine the accreting neutron star transient MAXI J0556-332, which is the
hottest transient, at the start of quiescence, observed to date. Models of the
quiescent light curve require a large deposition of heat in the shallow outer
crust from an unknown source. The additional heat injected is $\approx
4\textrm{-}10\,\mathrm{MeV}$ per accreted nucleon; when the observed decline in
accretion rate at the end of the outburst is accounted for, the required
heating increases to $\approx 6\textrm{-}16\,\mathrm{MeV}$. This shallow
heating is still required to fit the lightcurve even after taking into account
a second accretion episode, uncertainties in distance, and different surface
gravities. The amount of shallow heating is larger than that inferred for other
neutron star transients and is larger than can be supplied by nuclear reactions
or compositionally driven convection; but it is consistent with stored
mechanical energy in the accretion disk. The high crust temperature ($T_b
\gtrsim 10^{9} \, {\rm K}$) makes its cooling behavior in quiescence largely
independent of the crust composition and envelope properties, so that future
observations will probe the gravity of the source. Fits to the lightcurve
disfavor the presence of Urca cooling pairs in the crust.

sampling cuts in the tree from the model. Inference for the cuts is exact, and
formulated using dynamic programming. Our tree-cut model can be tuned to sample
segmentations at a particular scale of interest out of many possible multiscale
image segmentations. This generalizes the common notion that there should be
only one correct segmentation per image. Also, it allows moving beyond the
standard single-scale evaluation, where the segmentation result for an image is
averaged against the corresponding set of coarse and fine human annotations, to
conduct a scale-specific evaluation. Our quantitative results are comparable to

minimal dissipation for two model systems relevant to small-scale information

erase a single classical bit of information modelled by an overdamped particle

both models, we find that the minimal dissipation for the optimal protocol is
inversely proportional to protocol duration, as expected, though the
dissipation for the erasure model takes a different form than what we found

Pattern avoidance in matrices has applications in computer science and
engineering, such as robot motion planning and VLSI circuit design. A
$d$-dimensional zero-one matrix $A$ avoids another $d$-dimensional zero-one
matrix $P$ if no submatrix of $A$ can be transformed to $P$ by changing some
ones to zeros. A fundamental problem is to study the maximum number of nonzero
entries in a $d$-dimensional $n \times \cdots \times n$ matrix that avoids $P$.
This maximum number, denoted by $f(n,P,d)$, is called the extremal function.
  We advance the extremal theory of matrices in two directions. The methods
that we use come from combinatorics, probability, and analysis. Firstly, we
obtain non-trivial lower and upper bounds on $f(n,P,d)$ when $n$ is large for
every $d$-dimensional block permutation matrix $P$. We establish the tight
bound $\Theta(n^{d-1})$ on $f(n,P,d)$ for every $d$-dimensional tuple
permutation matrix $P$. This tight bound has the lowest possible order that an
extremal function of a nontrivial matrix can ever achieve. Secondly, we show
that $f(n,P,d)$ is super-homogeneous for a class of matrices $P$. We use this
super-homogeneity to show that the limit inferior of the sequence $\{ {f(n,P,d)
\over n^{d-1}}\}$ has a lower bound $2^{\Omega(k^{1/ d})}$ for a family of $k
\times \cdots \times k$ permutation matrices $P$. We also improve the upper
bound on the limit superior from $2^{O(k \log k)}$ to $2^{O(k)}$ for all $k

We focus our discussion on the eight complex organics detected within the HIFI
survey utilizing a novel technique to identify those molecules emitting in the
hottest gas. In particular, we find the complex nitrogen bearing species
CH$_{3}$CN, C$_{2}$H$_{3}$CN, C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN, and NH$_{2}$CHO systematically
trace hotter gas than the oxygen bearing organics CH$_{3}$OH, C$_{2}$H$_{5}$OH,
CH$_{3}$OCH$_{3}$, and CH$_{3}$OCHO, which do not contain nitrogen. If these
complex species form predominantly on grain surfaces, this may indicate
N-bearing organics are more difficult to remove from grain surfaces than
O-bearing species. Another possibility is that hot (T$_{\rm kin}$$\sim$300 K)
gas phase chemistry naturally produces higher complex cyanide abundances while
suppressing the formation of O-bearing complex organics. We compare our derived
rotation temperatures and molecular abundances to chemical models, which
include gas-phase and grain surface pathways. Abundances for a majority of the
detected complex organics can be reproduced over timescales $\gtrsim$ 10$^{5}$
years, with several species being under predicted by less than 3$\sigma$.
Derived rotation temperatures for most organics, furthermore, agree reasonably
well with the predicted temperatures at peak abundance. We also find that
sulfur bearing molecules which also contain oxygen (i.e. SO, SO$_{2}$, and OCS)
tend to probe the hottest gas toward Orion KL indicating the formation pathways
for these species are most efficient at high temperatures.

indicate that better generative models can be obtained with better approximate

propose a new model which guarantees that the top-down and bottom-up

interpreting both the top-down and the bottom-up directed models as approximate

geometric mean of these two. We present a lower-bound for the likelihood of

by fast search and find of density peaks (DPCLUS), and explores the power of
using this tree to perform hierarchical clustering. The array used to hold the
index of the nearest higher-densitied object for each object can be transformed
into a Leading Tree (LT), in which each parent node P leads its child nodes to
join the same cluster as P itself, and the child nodes are sorted by their
gamma values in descendant order to accelerate the disconnecting of root in
each subtree. There are two major advantages with the LT: One is dramatically
reducing the running time of assigning noncenter data points to their cluster
ID, because the assigning process is turned into just disconnecting the links
from each center to its parent. The other is that the tree model for
representing clusters is more informative. Because we can check which objects
are more likely to be selected as centers in finer grained clustering, or which
objects reach to its center via less jumps. Experiment results and analysis
show the effectiveness and efficiency of the assigning process with an LT.

maximum blueshift when the wind is directly toward us at mid X-ray eclipse, as

evidence for a massive black hole evaporates because the mass function of the

eclipses caused by absorption/scattering in the WR wind are all consistent with
either a low-stellar-mass BH or a NS. For a NS, the centre of mass lies inside
the WR envelope whose motion is then far below the observed 370 km/s RV
amplitude, while the velocity of the compact object is as high as 600 km/s. The
resulting 0.4\% doppler variation of X-ray spectral lines could be confirmed by

among stoichiometric transition-metal oxides. What makes it even more
remarkable is the half-metallic electronic structure. Today, CrO2 is widely
used in magnetorecording and regarded as a promising spintronic material.
Nevertheless, the key question ""Why is it ferromagnetic?"" remains largely
unanswered, despite general interest to the problem and practical importance of
CrO2. In the present work we challenge this question by combining
first-principles electronic structure calculations with the model Hamiltonian
approach and modern many-body methods for treating electron correlations. Our
analysis demonstrates that the problem is indeed highly nontrivial: at the
first glance, the ferromagnetism in CrO2 can be easily explained by Hund's rule
related exchange processes in the narrow t2g band. However, the electron
correlations, rigorously treated in the frameworks of dynamical mean-field
theory, tend to destabilize this state. The ferromagnetism reemerges if,
besides conventional kinetic energy changes in the t2g band, to consider other
mechanism, involving direct exchange and magnetic polarization of the oxygen
band. We show how all these contributions can be evaluated using
first-principles electronic structure calculations. Our results explain the
overall stability of the ferromagnetic state and provide the firm microscopic
basis for understanding the magnetism of CrO2.

the best case scenario of Pop III GRB energy and redshift distributions. Using
probability distribution functions fitted to the observed microphysical
parameters of long GRBs, we simulate a large number of Pop III GRB afterglows
to find the global probability of detection. We find that ASKAP may be able to
detect 35% of Pop III GRB afterglows in the optimistic case, and 27% in the
pessimistic case. A negligible number will be detectable by MWA in either case.
Detections per image for ASKAP, found by incorporating intrinsic rates with
detectable timescales, are as high as $\sim$ 6000 and as low as $\sim$ 11,
which shows the optimistic case is unrealistic. We track how the afterglow flux
density changes over various time intervals and find that, because of their
very slow variability, the cadence for blind searches of these afterglows
should be as long as possible. We also find Pop III GRBs at high redshift have
radio afterglow lightcurves that are indistinguishable from those of regular
long GRBs in the more local universe.

success. Here we show that both theory and phenomenology are consistent with
programmed death. Spatial evolutionary models show that self-limited lifespan
robustly results in long-term benefit to a lineage; longer-lived variants may
have a reproductive advantage for many generations, but shorter lifespan
ultimately confers long-term reproductive advantage through environmental
feedback acting on much longer time scales. Numerous model variations produce
the same qualitative result, demonstrating insensitivity to detailed
assumptions; the key conditions under which self-limited lifespan is favored
are spatial extent and locally exhaustible resources. Numerous empirical
observations can parsimoniously be explained in terms of long-term selective
advantage for intrinsic mortality. Classically anomalous empirical data on
natural lifespans and intrinsic mortality, including observations of longer
lifespan associated with increased predation, and evidence of programmed death
in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, are consistent with specific

carry out effective human-robot interactions. It is a nontrivial classification
problem which has attracted many research. In recent years, there is a high
exploitation of Artificial Intelligent algorithms in robotics applications.
Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning methods, we propose an
end-to-end learning approach for the place classification problem. With the
deep architectures, this methodology automatically discovers features and
contributes in general to higher classification accuracies. The pipeline of our
approach is composed of three parts. Firstly, we construct multiple layers of
laser range data to represent the environment information in different levels
of granularity. Secondly, each layer of data is fed into a deep neural network
model for classification, where a graph regularization is imposed to the deep
architecture for keeping local consistency between adjacent samples. Finally,
the predicted labels obtained from all the layers are fused based on confidence
trees to maximize the overall confidence. Experimental results validate the
effective- ness of our end-to-end place classification framework in which both
the multi-layer structure and the graph regularization promote the
classification performance. Furthermore, results show that the features
automatically learned from the raw input range data can achieve competitive
results to the features constructed based on statistical and geometrical
information.

of C*-algebras. As in the classical case, one may consider a quantum family of
maps preserving additional structures (e.g. quantum family of maps preserving a
state). In this paper we define a quantum family of homomorphisms of locally
compact quantum groups. Roughly speaking, we show that such a family is
classical. The purely algebraic counterpart of the discussed notion, i.e. a
quantum family of homomorphisms of Hopf algebras, is introduced and the
algebraic counterpart of the aforementioned result is proved. Moreover, we show
that a quantum family of homomorphisms of Hopf algebras is consistent with the
counits and coinverses of the given Hopf algebras. We compare our concept with
weak coactions introduced by Andruskiewitsch and we apply it to the analysis of
adjoint coaction.

on single-crystal metals or metal foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
However, once fabricated on metals, the h-BN/graphene lateral structures
require an additional transfer process for device applications, as reported for
CVD graphene grown on metal foils. Here, we demonstrate that a single-crystal
h-BN/graphene lateral structure can be epitaxially grown on a wide-gap
semiconductor, SiC(0001). First, a single-crystal h-BN layer with the same
orientation as bulk SiC was grown on a Si-terminated SiC substrate at 850 oC
using borazine molecules. Second, when heated above 1150 oC in vacuum, the h-BN
layer was partially removed and, subsequently, replaced with graphene domains.
Interestingly, these graphene domains possess the same orientation as the h-BN
layer, resulting in a single-crystal h-BN/graphene lateral structure on a whole
sample area. For temperatures above 1600 oC, the single-crystal h-BN layer was
completely replaced by the single-crystal graphene layer. The crystalline
structure, electronic band structure, and atomic structure of the h-BN/graphene
lateral structure were studied by using low energy electron diffraction,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy,
respectively. The h-BN/graphene lateral structure fabricated on a wide-gap
semiconductor substrate can be directly applied to devices without a further

across the star-forming ring galaxy NGC 6503, based on the deep HST photometry
obtained with the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We apply a
contour-based map analysis technique and identify in the stellar surface
density map 244 distinct star-forming structures at various levels of
significance. These stellar complexes are found to be organized in a
hierarchical fashion with 95% being members of three dominant super-structures
located along the star-forming ring. The size distribution of the identified
structures and the correlation between their radii and numbers of stellar
members show power-law behaviors, as expected from scale-free processes. The
self-similar distribution of young stars is further quantified from their
autocorrelation function, with a fractal dimension of ~1.7 for length-scales
between ~20 pc and 2.5 kpc. The young stellar radial distribution sets the
extent of the star-forming ring at radial distances between 1 and 2.5 kpc.
About 60% of the young stars belong to the detected stellar structures, while
the remaining stars are distributed among the complexes, still inside the ring
of the galaxy. The analysis of the time-dependent clustering of young
populations shows a significant change from a more clustered to a more
distributed behavior in a time-scale of ~60 Myr. The observed hierarchy in
stellar clustering is consistent with star formation being regulated by
turbulence across the ring. The rotational velocity difference between the
edges of the ring suggests shear as the driving mechanism for this process. Our
findings reveal the interesting case of an inner ring forming stars in a
hierarchical fashion.

increasing needs of Quality of Service (QoS), high data rates and diversity of

virtualization aims at providing solutions of mapping virtual network elements
onto radio resources of the existing physical network. This paper proposes the
Resources nEgotiation for NEtwork Virtualization (RENEV) algorithm, suitable
for application in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) in Long Term
Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) environments, consisting of a macro evolved NodeB
(eNB) overlaid with small cells. By exploiting Radio Resource Management (RRM)
principles, RENEV achieves slicing and on demand delivery of resources.
Leveraging the multi-tenancy approach, radio resources are transferred in terms
of physical radio Resource Blocks (RBs) among multiple heterogeneous base
stations, interconnected via the X2 interface. The main target is to deal with
traffic variations in geographical dimension. All signaling design
considerations under the current Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
LTE-A architecture are also investigated. Analytical studies and simulation
experiments are conducted to evaluate RENEV in terms of network's throughput as
well as its additional signaling overhead. Moreover we show that RENEV can be
applied independently on top of already proposed schemes for RAN virtualization
to improve their performance. The results indicate that significant merits are
achieved both from network's and users' perspective as well as that it is a
scalable solution for different number of small cells.

attracted much attention. As a disease begins to spread in the population,
information about the disease is transmitted to others, which in turn has an
effect on the spread of disease. In this paper, using empirical results of the
propagation of H7N9 and information about the disease, we clearly show that the
spreading dynamics of the two-types of processes influence each other. We build
a mathematical model in which both types of spreading dynamics are described
using the SIS process in order to illustrate the influence of information
diffusion on epidemic spreading. Both the simulation results and the pairwise
analysis reveal that information diffusion can increase the threshold of an
epidemic outbreak, decrease the final fraction of infected individuals and
significantly decrease the rate at which the epidemic propagates. Additionally,
we find that the multi-outbreak phenomena of epidemic spreading, along with the
impact of information diffusion, is consistent with the empirical results.
These findings highlight the requirement to maintain social awareness of
diseases even when the epidemics seem to be under control in order to prevent a
subsequent outbreak. These results may shed light on the in-depth understanding
of the interplay between the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information
diffusion.

young pulsar slows down with a surface magnetic field B that does not change.
Thus the pulsar follows a constant B trajectory in the phase space of spin
period and spin period time derivative. Such an evolution predicts a braking
index n = 3 while the field is constant and n > 3 when the field decays. This
contrasts with all nine observed values being n < 3. Here we consider a
magnetic field that is buried soon after birth and diffuses to the surface. We
use a model of a growing surface magnetic field to fit observations of the
three pulsars with lowest n: PSR J0537-6910 with n = -1.5, PSR B0833-45 (Vela)
with n = 1.4, and PSR J1734-3333 with n = 0.9. By matching the age of each
pulsar, we determine their magnetic field and spin period at birth and confirm
the magnetar-strength field of PSR J1734-3333. Our results indicate that all
three pulsars formed in a similar way to central compact objects (CCOs), with
differences due to the amount of accreted mass. We suggest that magnetic field
emergence may play a role in the distinctive glitch behaviour of low braking

orthodontics as a treatment planning tool to gauge the size and special
relationships of the teeth, jaws and cranium. The first step of using such
analyses is localizing some important landmarks known as cephalometric
landmarks on craniofacial in x-ray image. The past decade has seen a growing
interest in automating this process. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach is
proposed for automatic detection of cephalometric landmarks. Here, the
landmarks are categorized into three main sets according to their anatomical
characteristics and usage in well-known cephalometric analyses. Consequently,
to have a reliable and accurate detection system, three methods named edge
tracing, weighted template matching, and analysis based estimation are
designed, each of which is consistent and well-suited for one category. Edge
tracing method is suggested to predict those landmarks which are located on
edges. Weighted template matching method is well-suited for landmarks located
in an obvious and specific structure which can be extracted or searchable in a
given x-ray image. The last but not the least method is named analysis based
estimation. This method is based on the fact that in cephalometric analyses the
relations between landmarks are used and the locations of some landmarks are
never used individually. Therefore the third suggested method has a novelty in
estimating the desired relations directly. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach is compared with the state of the art methods and the results were
promising especially in real world applications.

take into account radiative damping, and derive the modifications thereof. Some
comparisons are also made with works from others. Essential agreement with the

ITER-relevant experiments, accurate fundamental and derived atomic data for
numerous ionization stages of tungsten (W) is required to assess the potential
effect of this species upon fusion plasmas. The results of fully relativistic,
partially radiation damped, Dirac $R$-matrix electron-impact excitation
calculations for the W$^{44+}$ ion are presented. These calculations use a
configuration interaction and close-coupling expansion that opens-up the
3d-subshell, which does not appear to have been considered before in a
collision calculation. As a result, it is possible to investigate the arrays,
[3d$^{10}$4s$^2-$3d$^9$4s$^2$4f] and [3d$^{10}$4s$^2-$3d$^9$4s4p4d], which are
predicted to contain transitions of diagnostic importance for the soft x-ray
region. Our $R$-matrix collision data are compared with previous $R$-matrix
results by Ballance and Griffin as well as our own relativistically corrected,
Breit-Pauli distorted wave and plane-wave Born calculations. All relevant data
are applied to the collisional-radiative modelling of atomic populations, for
further comparison. This reveals the paramount nature of the 3d-subshell
transitions from the perspectives of radiated power loss and detailed
spectroscopy.

theoretically and by simulation of spherical active Brownian particles (ABP).
We show that for certain geometries, the mechanical pressure as force/area of a
confined systems can equally be expressed by bulk properties, which implies the
existence of an nonequilibrium equation of state. Exploiting the virial
theorem, we derive expressions for the pressure of ABPs confined by solid walls
or exposed to periodic boundary conditions. In both cases, the pressure
comprises three contributions: the ideal-gas pressure due to white-noise random
forces, an activity-induce pressure (swim pressure), which can be expressed in
terms of a product of the bare and a mean effective propulsion velocity, and
the contribution by interparticle forces. We find that the pressure of
spherical ABPs in confined systems explicitly depends on the presence of the
confining walls and the particle-wall interactions, which has no correspondence
in systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our simulations of
three-dimensional APBs in systems with periodic boundary conditions reveal a
pressure-concentration dependence that becomes increasingly nonmonotonic with
increasing activity. Above a critical activity and ABP concentration, a phase
transition occurs, which is reflected in a rapid and steep change of the
pressure. We present and discuss the pressure for various activities and
analyse the contributions of the individual pressure components.

compliant binary labelings on the vertices of iterated standard chromatic
subdivisions of an n-simplex. The existance of such labelings is equivalent to
the existance of distributed protocols solving Weak Symmetry Breaking task in
the standard computational model.
  As a part of our formal model, we introduce function sb(n), defined for
natural numbers n, called the symmetry breaking function. From the geometric
point of view sb(n) denotes the minimal number of iterations of the standard
chromatic subdivision of an (n-1)-simplex, which is needed for the compliant
binary labeling to exist. From the point of distributed computing, the function
sb(n) measures the minimal number of rounds in a protocol solving the Weak
Symmetry Breaking task.
  In addition to the development of combinatorial topology, which is applicable
in a broader context, our main contribution is the proof of new bounds for the
function sb(n). Accordingly, the bulk of the paper is taken up by in-depth
analysis of the structure of adjacency graph on the set of n-simplices in
iterated standard chromatic subdivision of an n-simplex. On the algorithmic
side, we provide the first distributed protocol solving Weak Symmetry Breaking
task in the layered immediate snapshot computational model for some number of

  It is well known, that the smallest number of processes for which Weak
Symmetry Breaking task is solvable is 6. Based on our analysis, we are able to
find a very fast explicit protocol, solving the Weak Symmetry Breaking for 6
processes using only 3 rounds. Furthermore, we show that no protocol can solve
Weak Symmetry Breaking in fewer than 2 rounds.

current-limiting factors and develop a physics-based model of ASLD through
nano-magnet switching, the spin transport properties and the breakdown
characteristic of channel. First, ASLD with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
(PMA) nano-magnet is proposed to reduce the critical current (Ic0). Most
important, the spin transport efficiency can be enhanced by analyzing the
device structure, dimension, contact resistance as well as material parameters.
Furthermore, breakdown current density (JBR) of spin channel is studied for the
upper current limitation. As a result, we can deduce current-limiting
conditions and estimate energy dissipation. Based on the model, we demonstrate
ASLD with different structures and channel materials (graphene and copper).
Asymmetric structure is found to be the optimal option for current limitations.
Copper channel outperforms graphene in term of energy but seriously suffers
from breakdown current limit. By exploring the current limit and performance
tradeoffs, the optimization of ASLD is also discussed. This benchmarking model
of ASLD opens up new prospects for design and implementation of future
spintronics applications.

  Databases",,,"10.1016/j.tcs.2015.05.017",,"cs.AI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have constructed endgame databases for all single-component positions up
to 15 squares for Domineering, filled with exact Combinatorial Game Theory
(CGT) values in canonical form. The most important findings are as follows.
  First, as an extension of Conway's [8] famous Bridge Splitting Theorem for
Domineering, we state and prove another theorem, dubbed the Bridge Destroying
Theorem for Domineering. Together these two theorems prove very powerful in
determining the CGT values of large positions as the sum of the values of
smaller fragments, but also to compose larger positions with specified values
from smaller fragments. Using the theorems, we then prove that for any dyadic
rational number there exist Domineering positions with that value.
  Second, we investigate Domineering positions with infinitesimal CGT values,
in particular ups and downs, tinies and minies, and nimbers. In the databases
we find many positions with single or double up and down values, but no ups and
downs with higher multitudes. However, we prove that such single-component ups
and downs easily can be constructed. Further, we find Domineering positions
with 11 different tinies and minies values. For each we give an example. Next,
for nimbers we find many Domineering positions with values up to *3. This is
surprising, since Drummond-Cole [10] suspected that no *2 and *3 positions in
standard Domineering would exist. We show and characterize many *2 and *3
positions. Finally, we give some Domineering positions with values interesting
for other reasons.
  Third, we have investigated the temperature of all positions in our
databases. There appears to be exactly one position with temperature 2 (as
already found before) and no positions with temperature larger than 2. This
supports Berlekamp's conjecture that 2 is the highest possible temperature in
Domineering.

coarse approximations that result in false positives, because a dynamic monitor
sees only the executed trace of the program. One widely deployed method is the
no-sensitive-upgrade check, which terminates a program whenever a variable's
taint is upgraded (made more sensitive) due to a control dependence on tainted
data. Although sound, this method is restrictive, e.g., it terminates the
program even if the upgraded variable is never used subsequently. To counter
this, Austin and Flanagan introduced the permissive-upgrade check, which allows
a variable upgrade due to control dependence, but marks the variable
""partially-leaked"". The program is stopped later if it tries to use the
partially-leaked variable. Permissive-upgrade handles the dead-variable
assignment problem and remains sound. However, Austin and Flanagan develop
permissive-upgrade only for a two-point (low-high) security lattice and
indicate a generalization to pointwise products of such lattices. In this
paper, we develop a non-trivial and non-obvious generalization of
permissive-upgrade to arbitrary lattices. The key difficulty lies in finding a
suitable notion of partial leaks that is both sound and permissive and in
developing a suitable definition of memory equivalence that allows an inductive
proof of soundness.

single particle tracking, we investigate random thermal motion of colloidal
particles in a nematic liquid crystal for the time scales shorter than the
expected time of director fluctuations. At long times, compared to the
characteristic time of the nematic director relaxation we observe typical
anisotropic Brownian motion with the mean square displacement (MSD) linear in
time $\tau$ and inversly proportional to the effective viscosity of the nematic

in cryptographic applications. In photonic Bell experiments, a large amount of
the data that is generated comes from no-detection events and presumably
contains little randomness. This raises the question as to whether randomness
can be extracted only from the smaller post-selected subset corresponding to
proper detection events, instead of from the entire set of data. This could in
principle be feasible without opening an analogue of the detection loophole as
long as the min-entropy of the post-selected data is evaluated by taking all
the information into account, including no-detection events. The possibility of
extracting randomness from a short string has a practical advantage, because it
reduces the computational time of the extraction.
  Here, we investigate the above idea in a simple scenario, where the devices
and the adversary behave according to i.i.d. strategies. We show that indeed
almost all the randomness is present in the pair of outcomes for which at least
one detection happened. We further show that in some cases applying a
pre-processing on the data can capture features that an analysis based on
global frequencies only misses, thus resulting in the certification of more
randomness. We then briefly consider non-i.i.d strategies and provide an
explicit example of such a strategy that is more powerful than any i.i.d. one

that was not reported before in the context of Bell inequalities.

orders of magnitude due to the clustering of cold DM particles into the
small-scale and very dense self-gravitating clumps. We discuss the formation of
these clumps from the initial density perturbations and their successive fate
in the Galactic halo. Only a small fraction of these clumps, $\sim0.1$%, in
each logarithmic mass interval $\Delta\log M\sim1$ survives the stage of
hierarchical clustering. We calculate the probability of surviving the remnants
of dark matter clumps in the Galaxy by modelling the tidal destruction of the
small-scale clumps by the Galactic disk and stars. It is demonstrated that a
substantial fraction of clump remnants may survive through the tidal
destruction during the lifetime of the Galaxy. The resulting mass spectrum of
survived clumps is extended down to the mass of the core of the cosmologically
produced clumps with a minimal mass. The survived dense remnants of tidally
destructed clumps provide an amplification (boosting) of the annihilation
signal with respect to the diffuse DM in the Galactic halo. We describe the

reliable low-rank approximation of matrices in the presence of outliers.
Recently, the Robust PCA approach via nuclear norm minimization has been
extended to matrices with linear structures which appear in applications such
as system identification and data series analysis. At the same time it has been
shown how to control the rank of a structured approximation via matrix
factorization approaches. The drawbacks of these methods either lie in the lack
of robustness against outliers or in their static nature of repeated
batch-processing. We present a Robust Structured Low-Rank Approximation method
on the Grassmannian that on the one hand allows for fast re-initialization in
an online setting due to subspace identification with manifolds, and that is
robust against outliers due to a smooth approximation of the $\ell_p$-norm cost
function on the other hand. The method is evaluated in online time series
forecasting tasks on simulated and real-world data.

determining the black hole spin in accreting X-ray binary systems. There are,
however, still some unresolved issues with the underlying disk models. One of
them manifests as an apparent decrease in spin for increasing source
luminosity. Here, we perform a few simple tests to establish whether outflows
from the disk close to the inner radius can address this problem. We employ
four different parametric models to describe the wind and compare these to the
apparent decrease in spin with luminosity measured in the sources LMC~X-3 and
GRS~1915+105. Wind models in which parameters do not explicitly depend on the
accretion rate cannot reproduce the spin measurements. Models with mass
accretion rate dependent outflows, however, have spectra that emulate the
observed ones. The assumption of a wind thus effectively removes the artifact
of spin decrease. This solution is not unique; the same conclusion can be
obtained with a truncated inner disk model. To distinguish among valid models,
high resolution X-ray data and a realistic description of the Comptonization in
the wind will be needed.

pushing towards telling always the truth and the other pushing towards helping
others. Here we study how people resolve this moral conflict. What does telling
a white lie signal about a person's pro-social tendencies? To answer this
question, we conducted a two-stage 2x2 experiment. In the first stage, we used
a Deception Game to measure aversion to telling a Pareto white lie (i.e., a lie
that helps both the liar and the listener), and aversion to telling an
altruistic white lie (i.e., a lie that helps the listener at the expense of the
liar). In the second stage we measured altruistic tendencies using a Dictator
Game and cooperative tendencies using a Prisoner's dilemma. We found three
major results: (i) both altruism and cooperation are positively correlated with
aversion to telling a Pareto white lie; (ii) both altruism and cooperation are
negatively correlated with aversion to telling an altruistic white lie; (iii)
men are more likely than women to tell an altruistic white lie, but not to tell
a Pareto white lie. Our results shed light on the moral conflit between
pro-sociality and truth-telling. In particular, the first finding suggests that
a significant proportion of people have non-distributional notions of what the
right thing to do is: irrespective of their economic consequences, they tell
the truth, they cooperate, they share their money.

of the successive Hawking quanta being many times larger than the natural
timescale set by the energies of the emitted quanta. While this result has been
known for over 30 years, it has largely been forgotten. We shall focus on the
early-stage low-temperature regime, and shall confront numerical estimates with
semi-analytic approximations based on a naive Planck spectrum. First we shall
identify several natural dimensionless figures of merit, and thereby compare
the mean time between emission of successive Hawking quanta to several distinct
but quite natural timescales that can be associated with the emitted quanta,
demonstrating that very large ratios are typical for emission of massless
quanta from a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore these ratios are
independent of the mass of the black hole as it slowly evolves. We shall then
show that the situation for the more general Reissner-Nordstrom and generic
""dirty'' black holes is even worse, at least as long as the surrounding matter
satisfies some suitable energy conditions. The situation for the Kerr and
Kerr--Newman black holes (or even for charged particle emission from a
Reissner--Nordstrom black hole) is considerably trickier, and depends on a
careful accounting of the super-radiant modes. Overall, the Hawking quanta are
seen to be dribbling out of the black hole one at a time, in an extremely slow
cascade of 2-body decays. Among other things, this implies that the Hawking
flux is subject to ""shot noise''. Observationally, the Planck spectrum of the
Hawking flux can only be determined by collecting and integrating data over a
very long timescale. We conclude by connecting these points back to various
kinematic aspects of the Hawking evaporation process.

play an important role in determining the actual behavior of heat conduction.
Besides the total energy, total momentum and total stretch could also be
conserved quantities. In microcanonical Hamiltonian dynamics, the total energy
is always conserved. It was recently argued by Das and Dhar that whenever
stretch (momentum) is not conserved in a 1D model, the momentum (stretch) and
energy fields exhibit normal diffusion. In this work, we will systematically
investigate the stretch diffusions for typical 1D nonlinear lattices. No clear
connection between the conserved quantities and heat conduction can be
established. The actual situation is more complicated than what Das and Dhar
claimed.

mid-infrared high spatial resolution interferometric observations from
VLTI/MIDI. Aims. The aim of this work is to analyse the atmosphere of the
carbon-rich Mira RU Vir, with state of the art models, in this way deepening
the knowledge of the dynamic processes at work in carbon-rich Miras. Methods.
We compare spectro-photometric and interferometric measurements of this
carbon-rich Mira AGB star, with the predictions of different kinds of modelling
approaches (hydrostatic model atmospheres plus MOD-More Of Dusty,
self-consistent dynamic model atmospheres). A geometric model fitting tool is
used for a first interpretation of the interferometric data. Results. The
results show that a joint use of different kind of observations (photometry,
spectroscopy, interferometry) is essential to shed light on the structure of
the atmosphere of a carbon-rich Mira. The dynamic model atmospheres fit well
the ISO spectrum in the wavelength range {\lambda} = [2.9, 25.0] {\mu}m.
Nevertheless, a discrepancy is noticeable both in the SED (visible), and in the
visibilities (shape and level). A possible explanation are intra-/inter-cycle
variations in the dynamic model atmospheres as well as in the observations. The
presence of a companion star and/or a disk or a decrease of mass loss within
the last few hundred years cannot be excluded but are considered unlikely.

Schrodinger equation on bounded domains (such as rectangles, circles, and
annuli). These multipeak necklace solitary waves consist of several identical
positive profiles (pearls), such that adjacent pearls have opposite signs. They
are stable at low powers, but become unstable at powers well below the critical
power for collapse Pcr. This is in contrast with the ground-state
(single-pearl) solitary waves on bounded domains, which are stable at any power
below Pcr. On annular domains, the ground state solitary waves are radial at
low powers, but undergo a symmetry breaking at a threshold power well below
Pcr. As in the case of convex bounded domains, necklace solitary waves on the
annulus are stable at low powers and become unstable at powers well below Pcr.
Unlike on convex bounded domains, however, necklace solitarywaves on the
annulus have a second stability regime at powers well above Pcr. For example,
when the ratio of the inner to outer radii is 1:2, four-pearl necklaces are
stable when their power is between 3.1Pcr and 3.7Pcr. This finding opens the
possibility to propagate localized laser beams with substantiallymore power
than was possible until now. The instability of necklace solitary waves is
excited by perturbations that break the antisymmetry between adjacent pearls,
and is manifested by power transfer between pearls. In particular, necklace
instability is unrelated to collapse. In order to compute numerically the
profile of necklace solitary waves on bounded domains, we introduce a
non-spectral variant of Petviashvilis renormalization method.

bipartite system is crucial for exploring many areas of quantum information.
But such a detection should be made in a device independent way if the
preparation process of the state is considered to be faithful, in order to
avoid detection of a separable state as entangled one. The recently developed
scheme of detecting bipartite entanglement in a measurement device independent
way [Phys. Rev. Lett {\bf 110}, 060405 (2013)] does require information about
the state. Here by using Auguisiak et al.'s universal entanglement witness
scheme for two-qubit states [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 77}, 030301 (2008)], we provide
a universal detection scheme for two-qubit states in a measurement device

NPT-ness(negative under partial transpose) of states in a measurement device
independent way. We conjecture that no such universal entanglement witness
exists for PPT(positive under partial transpose) entangled states. We also
analyse the robustness of some of the experimental schemes of detecting
entanglement in a measurement device independent way under the influence of
noise in the inputs (from the referee) as well as in the measurement operator

gaseous phase is assumed to be transparent for the radiation, while the
suspended particles of the dust cloud ahead of the flame absorb and reemit the
radiation. The radiant heat absorbed by the particles is then lost by
conduction to the surrounding unreacted gaseous phase so that the gas phase
temperature lags that of the particles. The direct numerical simulations solve
the full system of two phase gas dynamic time-dependent equations with a
detailed chemical kinetics for a plane flames propagating through a dust cloud.
It is shown that depending on the spatial distribution of the dispersed
particles and on the value of radiation absorption length the consequence of
the radiative preheating of the mixture ahead of the flame can be either the
increase of the flame velocity for uniformly dispersed particles or ignition
either new deflagration or detonation ahead of the original flame via the
Zel'dovich gradient mechanism in the case of a layered particle-gas cloud
deposits. In the latter case the ignited combustion regime depends on the
radiation absorption length and correspondingly on the steepness of the formed
temperature gradient in the preignition zone that can be treated independently

correlated models, whereas multiple bands are needed to describe materials with

simulators to: (1) the form of optical lattices (2) the interactions between
electron analogues. Since the kinetic energy terms of electron analogues in a
quantum simulator and electrons in a solid are identical, by examining both
periodic potential and interaction we explore the full problem of many-band
quantum simulators within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Density
functional calculations show that bandstructure is highly sensitive to the form
of optical lattice, and it is necessary to go beyond sinusoidal potentials to
ensure that the bands closest to the Fermi surface are similar to those in real
materials. Analysis of several electron analogue types finds that dressed
Rydberg atoms (DRAs) have promising interactions for multi band quantum
simulation. DRA properties can be chosen so that interaction matrices
approximate those in real systems and decoherence effects are controlled,
albeit with parameters at the edge of currently available technology. We
conclude that multiband quantum simulators implemented using the principles
established here could provide insight into the complex processes in real
materials.

isogenies which are compatible with given principal polarisations. This is

is to show that certain questions about polarised isogenies can be reduced to
questions about unpolarised isogenies or vice versa.
  Our main theorem concerns abelian varieties B which are isogenous to a fixed
abelian variety A. It establishes the existence of a polarised isogeny A to B
whose degree is polynomially bounded in n, if there exist both an unpolarised
isogeny A to B of degree n and a polarised isogeny A to B of unknown degree. As
a further result, we prove that given any two principally polarised abelian

of the abelian varieties, using the Albert classification of these endomorphism
algebras and the classification of Hermitian forms over division algebras.

weak to strong scattering in a Parker spiral configuration, using relativistic
full orbit test particle simulations. The calculations retain all three spatial
variables describing particles' trajectories, allowing to model any transport
across the magnetic field. Large energy change is shown to occur for protons,
due to the combined effect of standard adiabatic deceleration and a significant
contribution from particle drift in the direction opposite to that of the solar
wind electric field. The latter drift-induced deceleration is found to have a
stronger effect for SEP energies than for galactic cosmic rays. The kinetic
energy of protons injected at 1 MeV is found to be reduced by between 35 and
90% after four days, and for protons injected at 100 MeV by between 20 and 55%.
The overall degree of deceleration is a weak function of the scattering mean
free path, showing that, although adiabatic deceleration plays a role, a large
contribution is due to particle drift. Current SEP transport models are found
to account for drift-induced deceleration in an approximate way and their
accuracy will need to be assessed in future work.

K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$, only possesses electron Fermi pockets. Their
distinctive electronic structure challenges the picture built upon iron
pnictide superconductors, where both electron and hole Fermi pockets coexist.
However, partly due to the intrinsic phase separation in this family of
compounds, many aspects of their behavior remain elusive. In particular, the
evolution of the 122$^{*}$ series of iron-chalcogenides with chemical
substitution still lacks a microscopic and unified interpretation. Using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we studied a major fraction of
122$^{*}$ iron-chalcogenides, including the isovalently `doped'
K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$, Rb$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$Te$_z$ and
(Tl,K)$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$. We found that the bandwidths of the low
energy Fe \textit{3d} bands in these materials depend on doping; and more
crucially, as the bandwidth decreases, the ground state evolves from a metal to
a superconductor, and eventually to an insulator, yet the Fermi surface in the
metallic phases is unaffected by the isovalent dopants. Moreover, the
correlation-driven insulator found here with small band filling may be a novel
insulating phase. Our study shows that almost all the known 122$^{*}$-series
iron chalcogenides can be understood {\it via} one unifying phase diagram which
implies that moderate correlation strength is beneficial for the
superconductivity.

the Sturmian representation, whereby the problem is reduced to evaluating the

$P^{stay}$ goes to $1$ for a state turning before reaching the continuum

slowly moving state just ""touching"" the threshold $P^{stay}$ tends to a
universal value of about $38\%$, for a broad class of potentials. In the rapid

propagation, and dissipation of large-scale eddies and is concentrated in
Earth's upper troposphere. An idealized GCM is used to investigate how this EMF
structure arises. In simulations in which the poles are heated more strongly
than the equator, EMF is concentrated near the surface, demonstrating that
surface drag generally is not responsible for the upper-tropospheric EMF
concentration. Although Earth's upper troposphere favors linear wave
propagation, quasi-linear simulations in which nonlinear eddy-eddy interactions
are suppressed demonstrate that this is likewise not primarily responsible for
the upper-tropospheric EMF concentration. The quasi-linear simulations reveal
the essential role of nonlinear eddy-eddy interactions in the surf zone in the
upper troposphere, where wave activity absorption away from the baroclinic
generation regions occurs through the nonlinear generation of small scales. In
Earth-like atmospheres, wave activity that is generated in the lower
troposphere propagates upward, then turns meridionally, eventually to be
absorbed nonlinearly in the upper troposphere. The level at which the wave
activity begins to propagate meridionally appears to be set by the typical
height reached by baroclinic eddies. This can coincide with the tropopause
height but also can lie below it if convection controls the tropopause height.
In the latter case, EMF is maximal well below the tropopause. The simulations
suggest that EMF is concentrated in Earth's upper troposphere because typical
baroclinic eddies reach the tropopause.

face-on Coma cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4921 show in unprecedented ways how ram
pressure strips the ISM from the disk of a spiral galaxy. New VLA HI maps show
a truncated and highly asymmetric HI disk with a compressed HI distribution in
the NW, providing evidence for ram pressure acting from the NW. Where the HI
distribution is truncated in the NW region, HST images show a well-defined,
continuous front of dust that extends over 90 degrees and 20 kpc. This dust
front separates the dusty from dust-free regions of the galaxy, and we
interpret it as galaxy ISM swept up near the leading side of the ICM-ISM
interaction. We identify and characterize 100 pc-1 kpc scale substructure
within this dust front caused by ram pressure, including head-tail filaments,
C-shaped filaments, and long smooth dust fronts. The morphology of these
features strongly suggests that dense gas clouds partially decouple from
surrounding lower density gas during stripping, but decoupling is inhibited,
possibly by magnetic fields which link and bind distant parts of the ISM.

due to their diffuse structure and transient nature, compounded by the
variations in their dynamics, morphology, and frequency of occurrence. The
large amounts of data available from missions like the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) make manual cataloging of CMEs tedious and prone to human
error, and so a robust method of detection and analysis is required and often
preferred. A new coronal image processing catalog called CORIMP has been
developed in an effort to achieve this, through the implementation of a dynamic
background separation technique and multiscale edge detection. These algorithms
together isolate and characterise CME structure in the field-of-view of the
Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard SOHO. CORIMP also applies
a Savitzky-Golay filter, along with quadratic and linear fits, to the
height-time measurements for better revealing the true CME speed and
acceleration profiles across the plane-of-sky. Here we present a sample of new
results from the CORIMP CME catalog, and directly compare them with the other
automated catalogs of Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) and Solar Eruptive
Events Detection System (SEEDS), as well as the manual CME catalog at the
Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) Data Center and a previously
published study of the sample events. We further investigate a form of
unsupervised machine learning by using a k-means clustering algorithm to
distinguish detections of multiple CMEs that occur close together in space and
time. While challenges still exist, this investigation and comparison of
results demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the CORIMP catalog,
proving its effectiveness at detecting and tracking CMEs throughout the LASCO
dataset.

bifurcations of nonlinear experiments. The basic idea is to apply the method of
numerical continuation to a feedback-controlled physical experiment. Since in
an experiment it is not (generally) possible to set the state of the system
directly, the control target is used as a proxy for the state. The challenge
then becomes to determine a control target such that the control is
non-invasive, that is, it stabilises a steady-state (or periodic orbit) of the
original open-loop experiment without altering it otherwise.
  Once implemented, control-based continuation enables the systematic
investigation of the bifurcation structure of a physical system, much like if
it was numerical model. However, stability information (and hence bifurcation
detection and classification) is not readily available due to the presence of
stabilising feedback control. This paper uses methods from the system
identification community to extract stability information in the form of
Floquet multipliers from the closed-loop experiment, thus enabling the direct
detection of bifurcations. In particular, it is shown that a periodic
auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) can be constructed that
approximates the time-varying linearisation of the experiment around a
particular periodic orbit. This method is demonstrated using a physical
nonlinear tuned mass damper.

each other (in case of a special type of Bi-Elliptic Restricted 4-Bodies
Problem) is presented. We consider here three primaries m1, m2, m3 orbiting
around their center of mass on elliptic orbits which are permanently forming
Lagrangian configuration of an equilateral triangle. Our aim is to obtain
appoximate coordinates of quasi planar trajectory of the infinitesimal
planetoid m4, when the primaries have masses equal to 1/3. Results are as
follows: 1) equations for coordinates {x, y} are described by system of coupled
2-nd order ordinary differential equations with respect to true anomaly f, 2)
expression for z stems from solving second order Riccati ordinary differential
equation that determines the quasi-periodical oscillations of planetoid m4 not
far from invariant plane {x, y, 0}.

astrophysical jets, explaining the movement phenomena of astrophysical jets. J.
C. Maxwell applied the quaternion analysis to describe the electromagnetic
theory. This encourages others to adopt the complex quaternion and octonion to
depict the electromagnetic and gravitational theories. In the complex octonion
space, it is capable of deducing the field potential, field strength, field
source, angular momentum, torque, force and so forth. As one component of the
force, the strength gradient force relates to the gradient of the norm of field
strength only, and is independent of not only the direction of field strength
but also the mass and electric charge for the test particle. When the strength
gradient force is considered as the thrust of the astrophysical jets, one can
deduce some movement features of astrophysical jets, including the bipolarity,
matter ingredient, precession, symmetric distribution, emitting, collimation,
stability, continuing acceleration and so forth. The above results reveal that
the strength gradient force is able to be applied to explain the main
mechanical features of astrophysical jets, and is the competitive candidate of
the dynamic of astrophysical jets.
