a nanoelectronic charge sensor, and the detection of events in a noisy sensor
signal is crucial for high fidelity readout of such qubits. The most common
detection scheme, comparing the signal to a threshold value, is accurate at low
noise levels but is not robust to low-frequency noise and signal drift. We
describe an alternative method for identifying charge sensor events using
wavelet edge detection. The technique is convenient to use and we show that,
with realistic signals and a single tunable parameter, wavelet detection can
outperform thresholding and is significantly more tolerant to 1/f and
low-frequency noise.

opportunities for new services and applications as well as new insights on user
online behavior, yet it raises serious privacy concerns. Prior literature has
proposed methods to match profiles and showed that it is possible to do it
accurately, but using evaluations that focused on sampled datasets only. In
this paper, we study the extent to which we can reliably match profiles in
practice, across real-world social networks, by exploiting public attributes,
i.e., information users publicly provide about themselves. Today's social
networks have hundreds of millions of users, which brings completely new
challenges as a reliable matching scheme must identify the correct matching
profile out of the millions of possible profiles. We first define a set of
properties for profile attributes--Availability, Consistency,
non-Impersonability, and Discriminability (ACID)--that are both necessary and
sufficient to determine the reliability of a matching scheme. Using these
properties, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of matching schemes in
real practical cases. Our results show that the accuracy in practice is
significantly lower than the one reported in prior literature. When considering
entire social networks, there is a non-negligible number of profiles that
belong to different users but have similar attributes, which leads to many
false matches. Our paper sheds light on the limits of matching profiles in the
real world and illustrates the correct methodology to evaluate matching schemes
in realistic scenarios.

become a hub to control users' other personal Internet-of-Things devices.
Access control on mobile devices is therefore highly important. The widely
accepted solution is to protect access by asking for a password. However,
password authentication is tedious, e.g., a user needs to input a password
every time she wants to use the device. Moreover, existing biometrics such as
face, fingerprint, and touch behaviors are vulnerable to forgery attacks.
  We propose a new touch-based biometric authentication system that is passive

touch behaviors are a function of some random ""secret"". The user can
subconsciously know the secret while touching the device's screen. However, an
attacker cannot know the secret at the time of attack, which makes it
challenging to perform forgery attacks even if the attacker has already
obtained the user's touch behaviors. We evaluate our touch-based authentication
system by collecting data from 25 subjects. Results are promising: the random
secrets do not influence user experience and, for targeted forgery attacks, our
system achieves 0.18 smaller Equal Error Rates (EERs) than previous touch-based

  with N\'eel domain walls in a Landau domain structure",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interaction of propagating dipolar spin waves with magnetic domain walls
is investigated in square-shaped microstructures patterned from the Heusler
compound Co$_2$Mn$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.4}$Si. Using magnetic force microscopy, the
reversible preparation of a Landau state with four magnetic domains separated
by N\'eel domain walls is confirmed. A local spin-wave excitation using a
microstructured antenna is realized in one of the domains. It is shown by
Brillouin light scattering microscopy (BLS) that the domain structure in the
remanence state has a strong influence on the spin-wave excitation and
propagation. The domain walls strongly reflect the spin waves and can be used
as spin-wave reflectors. A comparison with micromagnetic simulations shows that
the strong reflection is due to the long-range dipolar interaction which has
important implications for the use of these spin waves for exerting an
all-magnonic spin-transfer torque.

thermal to several GeV. In this paper we describe two beam diagnostic devices,
designed and built at INFN-LNS, both exploiting silicon detectors coupled with
neutron converter foils containing 6Li. The first one is based on four silicon
pads and allows to monitor the neutron beam flux as a function of the neutron
energy. The second one, based on position sensitive silicon detectors, is
intended for the reconstruction of the beam profile, again as a function of the
neutron energy. Several electronic setups have been explored in order to
overcome the issues related to the gamma flash, namely a huge pulse present at
the start of each neutron bunch which may blind the detectors for some time.
The two devices have been characterized with radioactive sources at INFN-LNS
and then tested at n-TOF. The wide energy and intensity range they proved
capable of sustaining, made them quite attractive and suitable to be used in
both EAR1 and EAR2 n-TOF experimental areas, where they became immediately
operational.

led to angular resolution of 0.1{\deg} and an unprecedented sensitivity. This
has allowed the current generation of Cherenkov telescopes to discover a
population of supernova remnants (SNRs) radiating in very-high-energy (VHE,
E>100 GeV) gamma-rays. A number of those VHE SNRs exhibit a shell-type
morphology spatially coincident with the shock front of the SNR. The members of
this VHE shell SNR club are RX J1713.7-3946, Vela Jr, RCW 86, SN 1006, and HESS
J1731-347. The latter two objects have been poorly studied in high-energy (HE,
0.1<E<100 GeV) gamma-rays and need to be investigated in order to draw the
global picture of this class of SNRs and constrain the characteristics of the
underlying population of accelerated particles. Using 6 years of Fermi P7
reprocessed data, we studied the HE counterpart of the SNRs HESS J1731-347 and
SN 1006. The two SNRs are not detected in the data and given that there is no
hint of detection, we do not expect any detection in the coming years from the
SNRs. However in both cases, we derived upper limits that significantly
constrain the gamma-ray emission mechanism and can rule out a standard hadronic
scenario with a confidence level > 5 sigma. With this Fermi analysis, we now
have a complete view of the HE to VHE gamma-ray emission of TeV shell SNRs. All
five sources have a hard HE photon index (<1.8) suggesting a common scenario
where the bulk of the emission is produced by accelerated electrons radiating
from radio to VHE gamma-rays through synchrotron and inverse Compton processes.
In addition when correcting for the distance, all SNRs show a surprisingly
similar gamma-ray luminosity supporting the idea of a common emission
mechanism. While the gamma-ray emission is likely to be leptonic dominated,
this does not rule out efficient hadron acceleration in those SNRs.

surrogate models based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions for
applications to uncertainty quantification (UQ) in aerodynamic computations. A
core ingredient in gPC expansions is the choice of a dedicated sampling
strategy, so as to define the most significant scenarios to be considered for
the construction of such metamodels. A desirable feature of the proposed rules
shall be their ability to handle several random inputs simultaneously. Methods
to identify the relative ""importance"" of those variables or uncertain data
shall be ideally considered as well. The present work is more particularly
dedicated to the development of sampling strategies based on sparsity
principles. Sparse multi-dimensional cubature rules based on general
one-dimensional Gauss-Jacobi-type quadratures are first addressed. These sets
are non nested, but they are well adapted to the probability density functions
with compact support for the random inputs considered in this study. On the
other hand, observing that the aerodynamic quantities of interest (outputs)
depend only weakly on the cross-interactions between the variable inputs, it is
argued that only low-order polynomials shall significantly contribute to their
surrogates. This ""sparsity-of-effects"" trend prompts the use of reconstruction
techniques benefiting from the sparsity of the outputs, such as compressed
sensing (CS). CS relies on the observation that one only needs a number of
samples proportional to the compressed size of the outputs, rather than their
uncompressed size, to construct reliable surrogate models. The results obtained
with the test case considered in this work corroborate this expected feature.

dominates at TeV energies. Generally the spatial shape and fraction of source
emission compared to diffuse emission in the Galactic plane is not well known

information about their external environment in order to survive. In most types

the extracellular side of the plasma membrane to the different metabolic
targets of their internal medium. This information might be encoded in the
amplitude, frequency, duration, waveform or timing of the calcium oscillations.
Thus, specific information coming from extracellular stimuli can be encoded in
the calcium signal and decoded again later in different locations within the
cell. Despite its cellular importance, little is known about the quantitative
informative properties of the calcium concentration dynamics inside the cell.
In order to understand some of these informational properties, we have studied
experimental Ca2+ series of Xenopus laevis oocytes under different external pH
stimulus. The data has been analyzed by means of information-theoretic
approaches such as Conditional Entropy, Information Retention, and other
non-linear dynamics tools such as the power spectra, the Largest Lyapunov

quantified the biomolecular information flows of the experimental data in bits,

emerge, which exhibit deterministic chaotic behavior, long term memory and
complex oscillations of the uncertainty reduction based on past values. The
understanding of the informational properties of calcium signals is one of the

We show that one may still achieve the Carnot efficiency, when certain
conditions on the bath structure are satisfied; however if that is not the
case, then the maximum achievable efficiency can reduce to a value which is
strictly less than Carnot. We derive the maximum efficiency for the case when
one of the baths is composed of qubits. Furthermore, we show that the maximum
efficiency is determined by either the standard second law of thermodynamics,
analogously to the macroscopic case, or by the non increase of the max relative
entropy, which is a quantity previously associated with the single shot regime
in many quantum protocols. This relative entropic quantity emerges as a
consequence of additional constraints, called generalized free energies, that
govern thermodynamical transitions in the nanoregime. Our findings imply that
in order to maximize efficiency, further considerations in choosing bath
Hamiltonians should be made, when explicitly constructing quantum heat engines
in the future. This understanding of thermodynamics has implications for
nanoscale engineering aiming to construct small thermal machines.

small number of predefined events, but cannot handle novel unseen events. This
motivates us to build a large scale event-specific concept library that covers
as many real-world events and their concepts as possible. Specifically, we
choose WikiHow, an online forum containing a large number of how-to articles on
human daily life events. We perform a coarse-to-fine event discovery process
and discover 500 events from WikiHow articles. Then we use each event name as
query to search YouTube and discover event-specific concepts from the tags of
returned videos. After an automatic filter process, we end up with 95,321
videos and 4,490 concepts. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
on the 95,321 videos over the 500 events, and use the model to extract deep
learning feature from video content. With the learned deep learning feature, we
train 4,490 binary SVM classifiers as the event-specific concept library. The
concepts and events are further organized in a hierarchical structure defined
by WikiHow, and the resultant concept library is called EventNet. Finally, the
EventNet concept library is used to generate concept based representation of
event videos. To the best of our knowledge, EventNet represents the first video
event ontology that organizes events and their concepts into a semantic
structure. It offers great potential for event retrieval and browsing.
Extensive experiments over the zero-shot event retrieval task when no training
samples are available show that the EventNet concept library consistently and
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (such as the 20K ImageNet
concepts trained with CNN) by a large margin up to 207%.

moment of a ferromagnetic material is seen to drop significantly on a timescale
of $10-100$s of femtoseconds due to the application of a strong laser pulse. If
this phenomenon can be harnessed for future technology, it offers the
possibility for devices operating at speeds several orders of magnitude faster
than at present. A key component to successful transfer of such a process to
technology is the controllability of the process, i.e. that it can be tuned in
order to overcome the practical and physical limitations imposed on the system.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the spin-orbit mediated form of ultrafast
demagnetization recently investigated [arXiv:1406.6607] by ab-initio
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can be controlled. To do so we
use quantum optimal control theory (OCT) to couple our TDDDT simulations to the
optimization machinery of OCT. We show that a laser pulse can be found which
maximizes the loss of moment within a given time interval while subject to
several practical and physical constraints. Furthermore we also include a
constraint on the fluence of the laser pulses and find the optimal pulse that
combines significant demagnetization with a desire for less powerful pulses.
These calculations demonstrate optimal control is possible for spin-orbit
mediated ultrafast demagnetization and lay the foundation for future
optimizations/simulations which can incorporate even more constraints.

correction due to a nonzero effective range $r_s$. We reveal a simple pattern
in these range corrections that had not been previously identified. The pattern
is explained by the renormalization group for the effective field theory, which
implies that the Efimov three-body parameter runs logarithmically with the

also explains the empirical observation that range corrections can be largely

Spielman and Srivastava (2013).
  Every $r$-covering of $G$ corresponds to a labeling of the edges of $G$ by

the edges by elements of various groups and present a broader scenario where
Ramanujan coverings are guaranteed to exist.
  In particular, this shows the existence of richer families of bipartite
Ramanujan graphs than was known before. Inspired by Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava,
a crucial component of our proof is the existence of interlacing families of
polynomials for complex reflection groups. The core argument of this component
is taken from a recent paper of them (2015).
  Another important ingredient of our proof is a new generalization of the
matching polynomial of a graph. We define the $r$-th matching polynomial of $G$

framework, where boundary heat flux and free boundary are components of the
control vector, and optimality criteria consist of the minimization of the sum
of $L_2$-norm declinations from the available measurement of the temperature
flux on the fixed boundary and available information on the phase transition
temperature on the free boundary. This approach allows one to tackle situations
when the phase transition temperature is not known explicitly, and is available
through measurement with possible error. It also allows for the development of
iterative numerical methods of least computational cost due to the fact that
for every given control vector, the parabolic PDE is solved in a fixed region
instead of full free boundary problem. In {\it Inverse Problems and Imaging, 7,
2(2013), 307-340} we proved well-posedness in Sobolev spaces framework and
convergence of time-discretized optimal control problems. In this paper we
perform full discretization and prove convergence of the discrete optimal
control problems to the original problem both with respect to cost functional
and control.

  Model","26 pages",,,,"math.DS math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we further investigate the global dynamics of a stochastic
differential equation SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) epidemic model
recently proposed in [A. Gray et al., SIAM. J. Appl. Math., 71 (2011),
876-902]. We present a stochastic threshold theorem in term of a
\textit{stochastic basic reproduction number} $R_0^S:$ the disease dies out
with probability one if $R_0^S<1,$ and the disease is recurrent if
$R_0^S\geqslant1.$ We prove the existence and global asymptotic stability of a
unique invariant density for the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the SDE
SIS model when $R_0^S>1.$ In term of the profile of the invariant density, we
define a \textit{persistence basic reproduction number} $R_0^P$ and give a
persistence threshold theorem: the disease dies out with large probability if
$R_0^P\leqslant1,$ while persists with large probability if $R_0^P>1.$
Comparing the \textit{stochastic disease prevalence} with the
\textit{deterministic disease prevalence}, we discover that the stochastic
prevalence is bigger than the deterministic prevalence if the deterministic
basic reproduction number $R_0^D>2.$ This shows that noise may increase
severity of disease. Finally, we study the asymptotic dynamics of the
stochastic SIS model as the noise vanishes and establish a sharp connection
with the threshold dynamics of the deterministic SIS model in term of a
\textit{Limit Stochastic Threshold Theorem}.

migration behaviours of single helium atoms near tungsten surfaces on the
surface orientation and temperature. For W{100} and W{110} surfaces, He atoms
can quickly escape out near the surface without accumulation even at a
temperature of 400 K. The behaviours of helium atoms can be well-described by
the theory of continuous diffusion of particles in a semi-infinite medium. For
a W{111} surface, the situation is complex. Different types of trap mutations
occur within the neighbouring region of the W{111} surface. The trap mutations
hinder the escape of He atoms, resulting in their accumulation. The probability
of a He atom escaping into vacuum from a trap mutation depends on the type of
the trap mutation, and the occurrence probabilities of the different types of
trap mutations are dependent on the temperature. This finding suggests that the
escape rate of He atoms on the W{111} surface does not show a monotonic
dependence on temperature. For instance, the escape rate at T=1500 K is lower
than the rate at T=1100 K. Our results are useful for understanding the
structural evolution and He release on tungsten surfaces and for designing
models in other simulation methods beyond molecular dynamics.

  Previous theoretical work has rigorously characterized label complexity of
active learning, but most of this work has focused on the PAC or the agnostic
PAC model. In this paper, we shift our attention to a more general setting --
maximum likelihood estimation. Provided certain conditions hold on the model
class, we provide a two-stage active learning algorithm for this problem. The
conditions we require are fairly general, and cover the widely popular class of
Generalized Linear Models, which in turn, include models for binary and
multi-class classification, regression, and conditional random fields.
  We provide an upper bound on the label requirement of our algorithm, and a
lower bound that matches it up to lower order terms. Our analysis shows that
unlike binary classification in the realizable case, just a single extra round
of interaction is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in maximum
likelihood estimation. On the empirical side, the recent work in

across the CTS, which is explicitly enforced by the ENTM scheme. ENTM is more
precise than ENTC for determining the position of the CTS, while the
performance of both schemes is good for the temperature/water-content profiles

the same time it is a very promising approach, since concurrent programs are
difficult to get right, or to analyze with traditional verification techniques.
This paper gives an introduction to distributed synthesis in the setting of
Mazurkiewicz traces, and its applications to decentralized runtime monitoring.
1 Context Modern computing systems are increasingly distributed and
heterogeneous. Software needs to be able to exploit these advances, providing
means for applications to be more performant. Traditional concurrent
programming paradigms, as in Java, are based on threads, shared-memory, and
locking mechanisms that guard access to common data. More recent paradigms like
the reactive programming model of Erlang [4] and Scala [35,36] replace shared
memory by asynchronous message passing, where sending a message is
non-blocking. In all these concurrent frameworks, writing reliable software is
a serious challenge. Programmers tend to think about code mostly in a
sequential way, and it is hard to grasp all possible schedulings of events in a
concurrent execution. For similar reasons, verification and analysis of
concurrent programs is a difficult task. Testing, which is still the main
method for error detection in software, has low coverage for concurrent
programs. The reason is that bugs in such programs are difficult to reproduce:
they may happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of
taking such corner-case schedules is very low. Automated verification, such as
model-checking and other traditional exploration techniques, can handle very
limited instances of concurrent programs, mostly because of the very large
number of possible states and of possible interleavings of executions. Formal
analysis of programs requires as a prerequisite a clean mathematical model for
programs. Verification of sequential programs starts usually with an
abstraction step -- reducing the value domains of variables to finite domains,
viewing conditional branching as non-determinism, etc. Another major
simplification consists in disallowing recursion. This leads to a very robust
computational model, namely finite-state automata and regular languages.
Regular languages of words (and trees) are particularly well understood
notions. The deep connections between logic and automata revealed by the
foundational work of B\""uchi, Rabin, and others, are the main ingredients in
automata-based verification .

The disk around the Herbig Ae star, HD 100546, shows structures that
suggest the presence of two companions in the disk at $\sim10$ and $\sim70$ AU.
The outer companion seems to be in the act of formation.
  Aims. Our aims are to provide constraints on the age of the planets in HD
100546 and to explore the potential evidence for sequential planet formation in
transition disks such as HD 100546.
  Methods. We compare the recent resolved continuum observations of the disk
around HD 100546 with the results of dust evolution simulations using an
analytical prescription for the shapes of gaps carved by massive planets.
  Results. An inner pressure bump must have been present since early in the
disk lifetime to have good agreement between the dust evolution models and the
continuum observations of HD 100546. This pressure bump may have resulted from
the presence of a very massive planet ($\sim20 M_{\rm{Jup}}$), which formed
early in the inner disk ($r\sim$10 AU). If only this single planet exists, the
disk is likely to be old, comparable to the stellar age ($\sim$5-10 Myr).
Another possible explanation is an additional massive planet in the outer disk
($r\sim70$ AU): either a low-mass outer planet ($\lesssim5 M_{\rm{Jup}}$)
injected at early times, or a higher mass outer planet ($\gtrsim15
M_{\rm{Jup}}$) formed very recently, traps the right amount of dust in pressure
bumps to reproduce the observations. In the latter case, the disk could be much
younger ($\sim3.0$ Myr).
  Conclusions. In the case in which two massive companions are embedded in the
disk around HD 100546, as suggested in the literature, the outer companion
could be at least $\gtrsim$2.5 Myr younger than the inner companion.

centrality, similarity, and influence measures. Often, however, the relevance
of a node $u$ to a node $v$ is more precisely measured not by the magnitude of
the distance, but by the number of nodes that are closer to $v$ than $u$. That
is, by the {\em rank} of $u$ in an ordering of nodes by increasing distance
from $v$.
  We identify and address fundamental challenges in rank-based graph mining. We
first consider single-source computation of reverse-ranks and design a
""Dijkstra-like"" algorithm which computes nodes in order of increasing
approximate reverse rank while only traversing edges adjacent to returned
nodes. We then define {\em reverse-rank influence}, which naturally extends
reverse nearest neighbors influence [Korn and Muthukrishnan 2000] and builds on
a well studied distance-based influence. We present near-linear algorithms for
greedy approximate reverse-rank influence maximization. The design relies on
our single-source algorithm. Our algorithms utilize near-linear preprocessing
of the network to compute all-distance sketches. As a contribution of
independent interest, we present a novel algorithm for computing these
sketches, which have many other applications, on multi-core architectures.
  We complement our algorithms by establishing the hardness of computing {\em
exact} reverse-ranks for a single source and {\em exact} reverse-rank
influence. This implies that when using near-linear algorithms, the small
relative errors we obtain are the best we can currently hope for.
  Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation on graphs with tens of
millions of edges, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.

and exhibits a strong elastic anisotropy with a cylindrical symmetry. Among the
various models which have been proposed to explain this anisotropy, one class
of models considers the effect of the Lorentz force associated with the
magnetic field diffused within the inner core. In this paper we extend previous
studies and use analytical calculations and numerical simulations to predict
the geometry and strength of the flow induced by the poloidal component of the
Lorentz force in a neutrally or stably stratified growing inner core, exploring
also the effect of different types of boundary conditions at the inner core
boundary (ICB). Unlike previous studies, we show that the boundary condition
that is most likely to produce a significant deformation and seismic anisotropy
is impermeable, with negligible radial flow through the boundary. Exact
analytical solutions are found in the case of a negligible effect of buoyancy
forces in the inner core (neutral stratification), while numerical simulations
are used to investigate the case of stable stratification. In this situation,
the flow induced by the Lorentz force is found to be localized in a shear layer
below the ICB, which thickness depends on the strength of the stratification,
but not on the magnetic field strength. We obtain scaling laws for the
thickness of this layer, as well as for the flow velocity and strain rate in
this shear layer as a function of the control parameters, which include the
magnitude of the magnetic field, the strength of the density stratification,
the viscosity of the inner core, and the growth rate of the inner core. We find
that the resulting strain rate is probably too small to produce significant
texturing unless the inner core viscosity is smaller than about $10^{12}$ Pa.s.

many problems in numerical linear algebra, optimization, and other areas of
scientific computing. To solve fixed-point problems, we propose ARock, an
algorithmic framework in which multiple agents (machines, processors, or cores)
update $x$ in an asynchronous parallel fashion. Asynchrony is crucial to
parallel computing since it reduces synchronization wait, relaxes communication
bottleneck, and thus speeds up computing significantly. At each step of ARock,
an agent updates a randomly selected coordinate $x_i$ based on possibly
out-of-date information on $x$. The agents share $x$ through either global
memory or communication. If writing $x_i$ is atomic, the agents can read and
write $x$ without memory locks.
  Theoretically, we show that if the nonexpansive operator $T$ has a fixed
point, then with probability one, ARock generates a sequence that converges to
a fixed points of $T$. Our conditions on $T$ and step sizes are weaker than
comparable work. Linear convergence is also obtained.
  We propose special cases of ARock for linear systems, convex optimization,
machine learning, as well as distributed and decentralized consensus problems.
Numerical experiments of solving sparse logistic regression problems are

secular variation data to produce the global magnetic field of the Earth.Our
kinematic dynamo calculations use quasi-geostrophic (QG) flows inverted from
geomagnetic field models which, as such, incorporate flow structures that are
Earth-like and may be important for the geodynamo.Furthermore, the QG
hypothesis allows straightforward prolongation of the flow from the core
surface to the bulk.As expected from previous studies, we check that a simple
quasi-geostrophic flow is not able to sustain the magnetic field against ohmic
decay.Additional complexity is then introduced in the flow, inspired by the
action of the Lorentz force.Indeed, on centenial time-scales, the Lorentz force
can balance the Coriolis force and strict quasi-geostrophy may not be the best
ansatz.When the columnar flow is modified to account for the action of the
Lorentz force, magnetic field is generated for Elsasser numbers larger than
0.25 and magnetic Reynolds numbers larger than 100.This suggests that our large
scale flow captures the relevant features for the generation of the Earth's
magnetic field and that the invisible small scale flow may not be directly
involved in this process.Near the threshold, the resulting magnetic field is
dominated by an axial dipole, with some reversed flux patches.Time-dependence
is also considered, derived from principal component analysis applied to the
inverted flows.We find that time periods from 120 to 50 years do not affect the
mean growth rate of the kinematic dynamos.Finally we notice the footprint of
the inner-core in the magnetic field generated deep in the bulk of the shell,

has been a notable lack of studies devoted to variations in Ly$\alpha$ emission
during solar flares in recent years. However, the few examples that do exist
have shown Ly$\alpha$ emission to be a substantial radiator of the total energy
budget of solar flares (on the order of 10%). It is also a known driver of
fluctuations in earth's ionosphere. The EUV Variability Experiment (EVE)
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory now provides broadband, photometric
Ly$\alpha$ data at 10 s cadence with its Multiple EUV Grating
Spectrograph-Photometer (MEGS-P) component, and has observed scores of solar
flares in the 5 years since it was launched. However, the MEGS-P time profiles
appear to display a rise time of tens of minutes around the time of the flare
onset. This is in stark contrast to the rapid, impulsive increase observed in
other intrinsically chromospheric features (H$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, LyC, C III,
etc.). Furthermore, the emission detected by MEGS-P peaks around the time of
the peak of thermal soft X-ray emission, rather than during the impulsive phase
when energy deposition in the chromosphere - often assumed to be in the form of
nonthermal electrons - is greatest. Given that spectrally-resolved Ly$\alpha$
observations during flares from SORCE/SOLSTICE peak during the impulsive phase
as expected, this suggests that the atypical behaviour of MEGS-P data is a
manifestation of the broadband nature of the observations. This could imply
that other lines and/or continuum emission that becomes enhanced during flares
could be contributing to the passband. Users are hereby urged to exercise
caution when interpreting broadband Ly$\alpha$ observations of solar flares.
Comparisons have also been made with other broadband Ly$\alpha$ photometers
such as PROBA2/LYRA and GOES/EUVS-E.

Jacobi fields. For the n-sphere and the manifold of symmetric positive definite

pulsar 4U 1626-67, correlated with changes in its luminosity and in the shape
of its pulse profile. Analysis of archival Chandra and RXTE observations
revealed the presence of an intrinsically narrow Fe Ka emission line in the
spectrum obtained during the source's current high luminosity period. However,
the line was not present during an XMM-Newton observation seven years earlier,
when the source was ~three times fainter. The line is resolved by the high
energy grating of Chandra at the 98% confidence level, and its small intrinsic
width, sigma=36.4 (-/+ 11.3,15.3)eV, suggests reflection off an accretion disk
at the radius R~7.5(-/+ 3.8,8.2)x10^8cm assuming a Keplerian disk, viewed at an
inclination angle of 20deg. This value is consistent with the radius of the
magnetosphere of the pulsar, suggesting that the line originates near the inner
edge of a disk that is truncated by the magnetic field of the neutron star.
Timing analysis of the XMM-Newton and RXTE data revealed a major change in the
pulse profile of the source from a distinct double peaked shape during the high
luminosity state when the line was present, to a much more complex multi-peak
structure during the low luminosity state. We argue that the appearance of the
line and the change in the shape of the pulse profile are correlated and are
the result of a major change in the emission diagram of the accretion column,
from a pencil-beam pattern at low luminosity, to a fan-beam pattern at high
luminosity.

and ""micro"" aspects. First, the rank-size rule is found not to be a standard
power law, as in many other studies, but a doubly decreasing power law. Next,
the Kendall and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients which measure pair
concordance and the correlation between fluctuations in two rankings,
respectively, - as a correlation function does in thermodynamics, are
calculated for finding rank correlation (if any) between demography and wealth.
Results show non only global disparities for the whole (country) set, but also
(regional) disparities, when comparing the number of cities in regions, the
number of inhabitants in cities and that in regions, as well as when comparing
the aggregated tax income of the cities and that of regions. Different outliers
are pointed out and justified. Interestingly, two classes of cities in the
country and two classes of regions in the country are found. ""Common sense""
social, political, and economic considerations sustain the findings. More
importantly, the methods show that they allow to distinguish communities, very
clearly, when specific criteria are numerically sound. A specific modeling for
the findings is presented, i.e. for the doubly decreasing power law and the two
phase system, based on statistics theory, e.g., urn filling. The model ideas
can be expected to hold when similar rank relationship features are observed in
fields. It is emphasized that the analysis makes more sense than one through a
Pearson value-value correlation analysis.

medium such as hydrogen gas, a strong Stokes signal, red-shifted by the Raman
transition frequency {\Omega}$_R$, is generated. This is accompanied by the
creation of a ""coherence wave"" of synchronized molecular oscillations with
wavevector {\Delta}{\beta} determined by the optical dispersion. Within its
lifetime, this coherence wave can be used to shift by {\Omega}$_R$ the
frequency of a third ""mixing"" signal, provided phase-matching is satisfied,
i.e., {\Delta}{\beta} is matched. Conventionally this can be arranged using
non-collinear beams or higher-order waveguide modes. Here we report collinear
phase-matched frequency shifting of an arbitrary mixing signal using only the
fundamental LP$_{01}$ modes of a hydrogen-filled hollow-core PCF. This is made
possible by the S-shaped dispersion curve that occurs around the
pressure-tunable zero dispersion point. Phase-matched frequency shifting by 125
THz is possible from the UV to the near-IR. Long interaction lengths and tight
modal confinement reduce the peak intensities required, allowing conversion
efficiencies in excess of 70%. The system is of great interest in coherent

energy to a wireless sensor node (WSN). Our analytical results show that by
using massive antenna arrays, the range of WET can be increased for a given

resulting into savings of radiated energy. We show that for energy levels used
in WET, the outage performance with least-squares or minimum mean-square error
channel estimates is same as that obtained based on perfect channel estimates.
We observe that a strong line-of-sight component between the BS and WSN lowers
outage probability. Furthermore, by deploying more antennas at the BS, a larger

performance for the sensor to be able to perform its main tasks. In our

transform the biological problem of determining transposons into a rigorous
mathematical problem of determining the longest common subsequence. Depending
on whether the gene sequence is linear (each sequence has a fixed head and
tail) or circular (we can choose any gene as the head, and the previous one is
the tail), and whether genes have multiple copies, we classify the problem of
determining transposons into four scenarios: (1) linear sequences without
duplicated genes; (2) circular sequences without duplicated genes; (3) linear
sequences with duplicated genes; (4) circular sequences with duplicated genes.
With the help of graph theory, we design fast algorithms for different

proximity and evolutionary state. Here, we provide a synthesis of recent
observational data from WISE and Planck with archival data, allowing to draw a
new and more complete picture on the history and evolution of the
Orion-Eridanus region. We discuss the general morphological structures and
observational characteristics of the superbubble, and derive quantitative
properties of the gas- and dust inside Barnard's Loop. We reveal that Barnard's
Loop is a complete bubble structure which, together with the lambda Ori region
and other smaller-scale bubbles, expands within the Orion-Eridanus superbubble.
We argue that the Orion-Eridanus superbubble is larger and more complex than
previously thought, and that it can be viewed as a series of nested shells,
superimposed along the line of sight. During the lifetime of the superbubble,
HII region champagne flows and thermal evaporation of embedded clouds
continuously mass-load the superbubble interior, while winds or supernovae from
the Orion OB association rejuvenate the superbubble by sweeping up the material
from the interior cavities in an episodic fashion, possibly triggering the
formation of new stars that form shells of their own. The steady supply of
material into the superbubble cavity implies that dust processing from interior
supernova remnants is more efficient than previously thought. The cycle of
mass-loading, interior cleansing, and star formation repeats until the
molecular reservoir is depleted or the clouds have been disrupted. While the
nested shells come and go, the superbubble remains for tens of millions of
years.

response variables can be adversarially corrupted. More specifically, for a
data matrix X \in R^{p x n} and an underlying model w*, the response vector is
generated as y = X'w* + b where b \in R^n is the corruption vector supported
over at most C.n coordinates. Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus
solely on L1-penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict
model assumptions such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected
independently of X.
  In this work, we study a simple hard-thresholding algorithm called TORRENT
which, under mild conditions on X, can recover w* exactly even if b corrupts
the response variables in an adversarial manner, i.e. both the support and
entries of b are selected adversarially after observing X and w*. Our results
hold under deterministic assumptions which are satisfied if X is sampled from
any sub-Gaussian distribution. Finally unlike existing results that apply only
to a fixed w*, generated independently of X, our results are universal and hold
for any w* \in R^p.
  Next, we propose gradient descent-based extensions of TORRENT that can scale
efficiently to large scale problems, such as high dimensional sparse recovery
and prove similar recovery guarantees for these extensions. Empirically we find
TORRENT, and more so its extensions, offering significantly faster recovery
than the state-of-the-art L1 solvers. For instance, even on moderate-sized
datasets (with p = 50K) with around 40% corrupted responses, a variant of our
proposed method called TORRENT-HYB is more than 20x faster than the best L1
solver.

expressed in tweets at these peaks, and finally to apply the ""event study""

steady states from density and speed time series of bottleneck experiments. The
threshold of the detection parameter in the algorithm is calibrated using an
autoregressive model. Comparing the detected steady states with previous
manually selected ones, the modified algorithm gives more reproducible results.
For the applications, three groups of bottleneck experiments are analysed and
the steady states are detected. The study about pedestrian flow shows that the
difference between the flows in all states and in steady state mainly depends
on the ratio of pedestrian number to bottleneck width. When the ratio is higher
than a critical value (approximately 115 persons/m), the flow in all states is
almost identical with the flow in steady state. Thus we have more possibilities
to compare the flows from different experiments, especially when the detection
of steady states is difficult.

the complexity of stationary strategies measured by their patience, which is

doubly exponential; and (ii) even in games with a single nonabsorbing state

objectives, the optimal bound on patience for epsilon-Nash equilibrium
strategies is only exponential.

an algorithm practical, X should be proximal-friendly -- admit a strongly

admits a computationally cheap Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) capable to

search for algorithms based solely on LMO's. For smooth convex minimization,
there exists a classical LMO-based algorithm -- Conditional Gradient. In

  Stochastic Reaction Networks and Application to Conditioned Path Sampling","31 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1016/j.jcp.2016.07.035",,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient analysis and simulation of multiscale stochastic systems of
chemical kinetics is an ongoing area for research, and is the source of many
theoretical and computational challenges. In this paper, we present a
significant improvement to the constrained approach, which is a method for
computing effective dynamics of slowly changing quantities in these systems,
but which does not rely on the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA). The QSSA
can cause errors in the estimation of effective dynamics for systems where the
difference in timescales between the ""fast"" and ""slow"" variables is not so
pronounced.
  This new application of the constrained approach allows us to compute the
effective generator of the slow variables, without the need for expensive
stochastic simulations. This is achieved by finding the null space of the
generator of the constrained system. For complex systems where this is not
possible, or where the constrained subsystem is itself multiscale, the
constrained approach can then be applied iteratively. This results in breaking
the problem down into finding the solutions to many small eigenvalue problems,
which can be efficiently solved using standard methods.
  Since this methodology does not rely on the quasi steady-state assumption,
the effective dynamics that are approximated are highly accurate, and in the
case of systems with only monomolecular reactions, are exact. We will
demonstrate this with some numerics, and also use the effective generators to
sample paths of the slow variables which are conditioned on their endpoints, a
task which would be computationally intractable for the generator of the full
system.

none of them is determined individually by the spectrum, which can be shown
using various examples. In particular, we prove that two isospectral
nilmanifolds of Heisenberg type with three-dimensional center are locally
isometric if and only if they have the same value of $|\nabla R|^2$. In
contrast, any pair of isospectral nilmanifolds of Heisenberg type with centers
of dimension $r>3$ does not differ in any curvature invariant of order six,
actually not in any curvature invariant of order smaller than $2r$. We also

discrimination framework for 5G Wireless Systems to allocate multiple carriers

In the proposed model, different classes of user groups are considered and
users are partitioned into different groups based on the carriers coverage
area. Each user has a minimum required application rate based on its class and
the type of its application. Our objective is to allocate multiple carriers
resources optimally among users, that belong to different classes, located
within the carriers' coverage area. We use a utility proportional fairness
approach in the utility percentage of the application running on the UE. Each
user is guaranteed a minimum quality of service (QoS) with a priority criterion
that is based on user's class and the type of application running on the UE. In
addition, we prove the existence of optimal solutions for the proposed resource
allocation optimization problem and present a multi-carrier resource allocation

evolving networks present a great challenge. Therefore, a number of different
techniques have been proposed for sampling large networks. In general, network
exploration techniques approximate the original networks more accurately than
random node and link selection. Yet, link selection with additional subgraph
induction step outperforms most other techniques. In this paper, we apply
subgraph induction also to random walk and forest-fire sampling. We analyze
different real-world networks and the changes of their properties introduced by
sampling. We compare several sampling techniques based on the match between the
original networks and their sampled variants. The results reveal that the
techniques with subgraph induction underestimate the degree and clustering
distribution, while overestimate average degree and density of the original
networks. Techniques without subgraph induction step exhibit exactly the
opposite behavior. Hence, the performance of the sampling techniques from
random selection category compared to network exploration sampling does not
differ significantly, while clear differences exist between the techniques with
subgraph induction step and the ones without it.

a variety of geophysical processes by directly measuring changes in the
gravitational potential. Vertical changes of the clock's position due to
magmatic, volcanic, post-seismic or tidal deformations can result in measurable
variations in the clock tick rate. As an example, we discuss the geopotential
change arising due to an inflating point source (Mogi model), and apply it to
the Etna volcano. Its effect on an observer on the Earth's surface can be
divided into two different terms: one purely due to uplift and one due to the
redistribution of matter. Thus, with the centimetre-level precision of current
clocks it is already possible to monitor volcanoes. The matter redistribution
term is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the uplift term,
and should be resolvable when clocks improve their stability to the
sub-millimetre level. Additionally, clocks can be compared over distances of
thousands of kilometres on a short-term basis (e.g. hourly). These clock

Monte Carlo sampling showing that statistical errors are in general small
compared to systematic ones. In conclusion, we find that a simultaneous fit to
different sets of data is critical to (i) identify the optimal set of LECs,
(ii) capture all relevant correlations, (iii) reduce the statistical
uncertainty, and (iv) attain order-by-order convergence in chiEFT. Furthermore,
certain systematic uncertainties in the few-nucleon sector are shown to get
substantially magnified in the many-body sector; in particlar when varying the
cutoff in the chiral potentials. The methodology and results presented in this
Paper open a new frontier for uncertainty quantification in ab initio nuclear
theory.

exponential convergence of solutions to the steady state. In this application
of the modified entropy method symmetric positive definite matrices solving a

short-period transiting hot Jupiter, whose planetary nature has been
statistically validated by the PASTIS software. The planet has a mass of
$1.183_{-0.062}^{+0.064}$ $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, a radius of 1.865 $\pm$ 0.044
$R_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, and transits every $1.2749255_{-0.0000025}^{+0.0000020}$
days an active F6-type main-sequence star ($V$=10.4, $1.353_{-0.079}^{+0.080}$
$M_{\odot}$, 1.458 $\pm$ 0.030 $R_{\odot}$, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = 6460 $\pm$ 140
K). A notable property of WASP-121 b is that its orbital semi-major axis is
only $\sim$1.15 times larger than its Roche limit, which suggests that the
planet might be close to tidal disruption. Furthermore, its large size and
extreme irradiation ($\sim$$7.1\:10^{9}$ erg $\mathrm{s}^{-1}
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) make it an excellent target for atmospheric studies via
secondary eclipse observations. Using the TRAPPIST telescope, we indeed detect
its emission in the $z'$-band at better than $\sim$4$\sigma$, the measured
occultation depth being 603 $\pm$ 130 ppm. Finally, from a measurement of the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect with the CORALIE spectrograph, we infer a
sky-projected spin-orbit angle of $257.8_{-5.5}^{+5.3}$ deg. This result
indicates a significant misalignment between the spin axis of the host star and
the orbital plane of the planet, the planet being in a nearly polar orbit. Such
a high misalignment suggests a migration of the planet involving strong
dynamical events with a third body.

answer this question we use the Bayesian approach where the emphasis on finding

as the guiding principle. The 20-parameter minimal supersymmetric standard

prior-independent upper bound on the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass $m_A$ as a
function of $\tan \beta$, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the
MSSM Higgs doublets. For a 30-parameter MSSM this implies that $m_A \lesssim 3$
TeV and $\tan \beta \lesssim 25$ at 95\% Bayesian confidence. Removing the
contradictory subjectiveness within the electroweak fine-tuning measure leads
to finding the naturalness line, $m_A \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, m_Z \, \tan

data post-processing, this work extensively investigates a Bayesian
reconstruction approach using a simulated database. A Bayesian fusion model is
developed to solve the inverse problem of data reconstruction. The model uses a
Maximum A Posteriori estimate, which yields the most probable field knowing the
measurements. The DNS of a wall-bounded turbulent flow at moderate Reynolds
number is used to validate and assess the performances of the present approach.
Low resolution measurements are subsampled in time and space from the fully
resolved data. Reconstructed velocities are compared to the reference DNS to
estimate the reconstruction errors. The model is compared to other conventional
methods such as Linear Stochastic Estimation and cubic spline interpolation.
Results show the superior accuracy of the proposed method in all
configurations. Further investigations of model performances on various range
of scales demonstrate its robustness. Numerical experiments also permit to
estimate the expected maximum information level corresponding to limitations of

constant, $\xi_c = 0.34403427_{- 0.18907353}^{+ 0.14430125}$ at 1 $\sigma$

$\beta= -0.50863232_{- 0.40923857}^{+ 0.48424166}$ at 1 $\sigma$ level. The CMB
temperature power spectrum indicates that a large coupling constant produces a
shift of the acoustic peaks and affects their amplitudes at lower multipoles.
In addition, a larger $\beta$ exponent generates a shift of the acoustic peaks,
pointing a clear deviation with respect to the concordance model. The matter
power spectrum are sensitive to the variation of the coupling constant and the
$\beta$ exponent. In this context, the interaction alters the scale of matter

generates a shift of the turnover point toward to smaller scale.

a wide range of timescales. The short, coherent variations, with frequencies
above 1 Hz, are referred to as quasi-periodic oscillations, and are generally
explained by resonant effects in the black hole accretion flow. The purely
stochastic variability that occurs due to turbulent conditions in the plasma,
is quantified by the power density spectra and appears practically in all types
of sources and their spectral states. The specific kind of quasi-periodic
flares is expected, when the global structure of the accretion flow, governed
by the nonlinear hydrodynamics, induces fluctuations around a fixed point
solution. These conditions, which occur at high accretion rates, lead to the
variability in the sense of deterministic chaos. We study the nonlinear
behaviour of X-ray sources using the recurrence analysis method. We estimate
quantitatively the indications for deterministic chaos, such as the Renyi's
entropy, for the observed time series, and we compare them with the surrogate
data. Using the data collected by RXTE satellite, we reveal the oscillations
pattern and the observable properties of six black hole systems. We confirm
that both the well known microquasar GRS 1915+105, as well as its recently
discovered analogue, IGR J17091-3624, exhibit variability characteristic to

of the process must be intrinsically connected in these sources with the
accretion flow instability, that leads to the limit cycle oscillations around a
fixed point. Furthermore, we studied four other black hole candidates with high
accretion rates. For GX 339-4, GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1550-564 we obtained

kernel is an approximation for the Green's function of a hypo-elliptic
diffusion on the 3D rigid body motion group SE(3), for fiber enhancement in
dMRI. The enhancements are described by linear scale space PDEs in the coupled
space of positions and orientations embedded in SE(3). As initial condition for
the evolution we use either a Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD) or an
Orientation Density Function (ODF). Explicit formulas for the exact kernel do
not exist. Although approximations well-suited for fast implementation have
been proposed in literature, they lack important symmetries of the exact
kernel. We introduce techniques to include these symmetries in approximations
based on the logarithm on SE(3), resulting in an improved kernel. Regarding
neuroimaging applications, we apply our enhancement kernel (a) to improve dMRI
tractography results and (b) to quantify coherence of obtained streamline
bundles.

only the UV show a weaker bimodality than those subtracting from visual bands
and that cluster sets with a distinct bimodality are in principle older than
those with only a weak bimodal distribution. Furthermore a bimodal color
distribution of coeval clusters implies a bimodal metallicity distribution, but
a unimodal color distribution does not imply a unimodal metallicity

self-gravitating discs which, in contrast to studies that emphasise the
`gravoturbulent' nature of such discs, instead focuses on the properties of
their quasi-regular spiral structures. Within this framework there are two
evolutionary paths to fragmentation: i) collapse on the free-fall time, which
requires that the ratio of cooling time to dynamical time ($\beta$) $< 3$ and
ii) quasistatic collapse on the cooling time at a rate that is sufficiently
fast that fragments are compact enough to withstand disruption when they
encounter spiral features in the disc.
  We perform 2D grid simulations which demonstrate numerically converged
fragmentation at $\beta < 3$ (in good agreement with Paardekooper et al. (2011)
and others) and argue that this is a consequence of the fact that such
simulations smooth the gravitational force on the scale $H$, the scale height
of the disc. Such simulations thus only allow fragmentation via route i) above
since they suppress the quasistatic contraction of fragments on scales $< H$;
the inability of fragments to contract to significantly smaller scales then
renders them susceptible to disruption at the next spiral arm encounter.
  On the other hand, 3D simulations indeed show fragmentation at higher $\beta$
via route ii). We derive an analytic prediction of fragmentation by route ii)
when $\beta \lesssim 12$, based on the requirement that fragments must contract
sufficiently to withstand disruption by spiral arms. We also discuss the
necessary numerical requirements on both grid based and SPH codes if they are
to model fragmentation via route ii).

The first operator of the Lax pair corresponding to a given nonlinear equation
is found immediately, coinciding with the linearization of the considered
nonlinear equation. The second one is obtained as an invariant manifold to the
linearized equation. A surprisingly simple relation between the second operator
of the Lax pair and the recursion operator is discussed: the recursion operator
can immediately be found from the Lax pair. Examples considered in the article
are convincing evidence that the found Lax pairs differ from the classical
ones. The examples also show that the suggested objects are true Lax pairs
which allow the construction of infinite series of conservation laws and
hierarchies of higher symmetries. In the case of the hyperbolic type partial
differential equation our algorithm is slightly modified; in order to construct
the Lax pairs from the invariant manifolds we use the cutting off conditions
for the corresponding infinite Laplace sequence. The efficiency of the method
is illustrated by application to some equations given in the Svinolupov-Sokolov

useful measure to select the best performing CNN out of multiple candidates for

delta-squared process, which accelerates convergence of fixed point update. The
proposed Bayesian evidence framework also provides a good solution to identify
the best ensemble of heterogeneous CNNs through a greedy algorithm. Our

to Maxwell field tensor, generalization of Schwarzschild solution by
introduction of quadratic curvature terms of all possible form to the
Einstein-Hilbert action and finally regular black hole solutions. In all these

efficacy) are becoming available for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. This
therapeutic revolution leads us to consider possibility of eradicating the
virus. However, for this, an effective cascade of care is required. Methods: In
the context of the incoming DAAs, we used a dynamic individual-based model
including a model of the people who inject drugs (PWID) social network to
simulate the impact of improved testing, linkage to care, and adherence to
treatment, and of modified treatment recommendation on the transmission and on
the morbidity of HCV in PWID in France. Results: Under the current incidence
and cascade of care, with treatment initiated at fibrosis stage $\ge$F2, the
HCV prevalence decreased from 42.8% to 24.9% [95% confidence interval
24.8%--24.9%] after 10 years. Changing treatment initiation criteria to treat
from F0 was the only intervention leading to a substantial additional decrease
in the prevalence, which fell to 11.6% [11.6%--11.7%] at 10 years. Combining
this change with improved testing, linkage to care, and adherence to treatment
decreased HCV prevalence to 7% [7%--7.1%] at 10 years and avoided 15.3%
[14.0%-16.6%] and 29.0% [27.9%--30.1%] of cirrhosis complications over 10 and
40 years respectively. Conclusion: A high decrease in viral transmission occurs
only when treatment is initiated before liver disease progresses to severe

  Program Diversity",,,,,"cs.CR cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tamper-resistance is a fundamental software security research area. Many
approaches have been proposed to thwart specific procedures of tampering, e.g.,
obfuscation and self-checksumming. However, to our best knowledge, none of them
can achieve theoretically tamper-resistance. Our idea is to impede the
replication of tampering via program diversification, and thus increasing the
complexity to break the whole software system. To this end, we propose to
deliver same featured, but functionally nonequivalent software copies to
different machines. We formally define the problem as N-version obfuscation,
and provide a viable means to solve the problem. Our evaluation result shows
that the time required for breaking a software system is linearly increased
with the number of software versions, which is O(n) complexity.

number of a vehicle. The current system mainly uses Optical Character
Recognition to recognize the number plate. There are several problems to this
system. Some of them include interchanging of several letters or numbers
(letter O with digit 0), difficulty in localizing the license plate, high error
rate, use of different fonts in license plates etc. So a new system to
recognize the license plate number using color coding of license plates is
proposed in this paper. Easier localization of license plate can be done by
searching for the start or stop patters of license plates. An eight segment
display system along with traditional numbering with the first and last
segments left for start or stop patterns is proposed in this paper. Practical
applications include several areas under Internet of Things (IoT).

  150113, 2015",,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the tidal force, whose notion is sometimes misunderstood in the
public domain literature. We discuss the tidal force exerted by a secondary
point mass on an extended primary body such as the Earth. The tidal force
arises because the gravitational force exerted on the extended body by the
secondary mass is not uniform across the primary. In the derivation of the
tidal force, the non-uniformity of the gravity is essential, and inertial
forces such as the centrifugal force are not needed. Nevertheless, it is often
asserted that the tidal force can be explained by the centrifugal force. If we
literally take into account the centrifugal force, it would mislead us. We
therefore also discuss the proper treatment of the centrifugal force.

  MIMO Detectors with 256-QAM",,,"10.1109/TSP.2015.2446441",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an optimized low-complexity and high-throughput
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal detector core for detecting
spatially-multiplexed data streams. The core architecture supports various
layer configurations up to 4, while achieving near-optimal performance, as well
as configurable modulation constellations up to 256-QAM on each layer. The core
is capable of operating as a soft-input soft-output log-likelihood ratio (LLR)
MIMO detector which can be used in the context of iterative detection and
decoding. High area-efficiency is achieved via algorithmic and architectural
optimizations performed at two levels. First, distance computations and slicing
operations for an optimal 2-layer maximum a posteriori (MAP) MIMO detector are
optimized to eliminate the use of multipliers and reduce the overhead of
slicing in the presence of soft-input LLRs. We show that distances can be
easily computed using elementary addition operations, while optimal slicing is
done via efficient comparisons with soft decision boundaries, resulting in a
simple feed-forward pipelined architecture. Second, to support more layers, an
efficient channel decomposition scheme is presented that reduces the detection
of multiple layers into multiple 2-layer detection subproblems, which map onto
the 2-layer core with a slight modification using a distance accumulation stage
and a post-LLR processing stage. Various architectures are accordingly
developed to achieve a desired detection throughput and run-time
reconfigurability by time-multiplexing of one or more component cores. The
proposed core is applied as well to design an optimal multi-user MIMO detector
for LTE. The core occupies an area of 1.58MGE and achieves a throughput of 733
Mbps for 256-QAM when synthesized in 90 nm CMOS.

  Reconstruction","29 pages",,,,"cs.CV cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider tomographic reconstruction using priors in the form of a
dictionary learned from training images. The reconstruction has two stages:
first we construct a tensor dictionary prior from our training data, and then
we pose the reconstruction problem in terms of recovering the expansion
coefficients in that dictionary. Our approach differs from past approaches in
that a) we use a third-order tensor representation for our images and b) we
recast the reconstruction problem using the tensor formulation. The dictionary
learning problem is presented as a non-negative tensor factorization problem
with sparsity constraints. The reconstruction problem is formulated in a convex
optimization framework by looking for a solution with a sparse representation
in the tensor dictionary. Numerical results show that our tensor formulation
leads to very sparse representations of both the training images and the
reconstructions due to the ability of representing repeated features compactly
in the dictionary.

  generation money tool","55 pages, 9 figures",,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a high level network architecture for an economic system that
integrates money, governance and reputation. We introduce a method for issuing,
and redeeming a digital coin using a mechanism to create a sustainable global
economy and a free market. To maintain a currency's value over time, and
therefore be money proper, we claim it must be issued by the buyer and backed
for value by the seller, exchanging the products of labour, in a free market.
We also claim that a free market and sustainable economy cannot be maintained
using economically arbitrary creation and allocation of money. Nakamoto, with
Bitcoin, introduced a new technology called the cryptographic blockchain to
operate a decentralised and distributed accounts ledger without the need for an
untrusted third party. This blockchain technology creates and allocates new
digital currency as a reward for ""proof-of-work"", to secure the network.
However, no currency, digital or otherwise, has solved how to create and
allocate money in an economically non-arbitrary way, or how to govern and trust
a world-scale free enterprise money system. We propose an ""Ontologically
Networked Exchange"" (ONE), with purpose as its highest order domain. Each
purpose is defined in a contract, and the entire economy of contracts is
structured in a unified ontology. We claim to secure the ONE network using
economically non-arbitrary methodologies and economically incented human
behaviour. Decisions influenced by reputation help to secure the network
without an untrusted third party. The stack of contracts, organised in a
unified ontology, functions as a super recursive algorithm, with individual use
programming the algorithm, acting as the ""oracle"". The state of the algorithm
becomes the ""memory"" of a scalable and trustable artificial intelligence (AI).
This AI offers a new platform for what we call the ""Autonomy-of-Things"" (AoT).
