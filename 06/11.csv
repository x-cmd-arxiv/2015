  100 GHz",,,,,"physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  The demand for higher data rates and better synchronization in communication
and navigation systems necessitates the development of new wideband and tunable
sources with noise performance exceeding that provided by traditional
oscillators and synthesizers. Precision synthesis is paramount for providing
frequency references and timing in a broad range of applications including
next-generation telecommunications, high precision measurement, and radar and
sensing. Here we describe a digital-photonic synthesizer (DPS) based on optical
frequency division that enables the generation of widely tunable signals from
near DC to 100 GHz with a fractional frequency instability of 1 part in 10^15.
The spectral purity of the DPS derived signals represents an improvement in
close-to-carrier noise performance over the current state-of-the-art of nearly
7 orders of magnitude in the W-band (100 GHz), and up to 5 orders of magnitude
in the X-band (10 GHz).

the approach of Agarwal et al. (2014) for the non-constrained version of the

wide-band spectral data with low energy coverage allowed us to characterize the

is adequately described by a combination of a low temperature (kT ~ 0.8 keV)
blackbody and a power-law with high energy cutoff (Ecut ~ 5.4 keV) without the
need for a broad Gaussian at ~ 10 keV as used in some earlier studies. Though
winds from the companion can affect the emission from the neutron star at low
energies (< 3 keV), the blackbody component shows a significant presence in our
continuum model. We report evidence for the possible presence of two
independent sets of CRSFs with fundamentals at ~ 11 keV and ~ 15 keV. These two
sets of CRSFs could arise from spatially distinct emitting regions. We also
find evidence for variations in the line equivalent widths, with the 11 keV
CRSF weakening and the 15 keV line strengthening with decreasing luminosity.
Finally, we propose that the reason for the earlier observed anti-correlation
of line energy with luminosity could be due to modelling of these two
independent line sets (~ 11 keV and ~ 15 keV) as a single CRSF.

a special yet representative case. These results also provide insights into the
general sensitivity of the algorithm to the choice of priors. In particular,
with $p$ being the prior probability mass of the true reward-generating model,
we prove $O(\sqrt{T/p})$ and $O(\sqrt{(1-p)T})$ regret upper bounds for the
bad- and good-prior cases, respectively, as well as \emph{matching} lower

self-interference. Many designs have employed spatial isolation mechanisms,
such as shielding or multi-antenna beamforming, to isolate the
self-interference wave from the receiver. Such spatial isolation methods are
effective, but by confining the transmit and receive signals to a subset of the
available space, the full spatial resources of the channel be under-utilized,
expending a cost that may nullify the net benefit of operating in full-duplex
mode. In this paper we leverage an antenna-theory-based channel model to
analyze the spatial degrees of freedom available to a full-duplex capable base
station, and observe that whether or not spatial isolation out-performs
time-division (i.e. half-duplex) depends heavily on the geometric distribution
of scatterers. Unless the angular spread of the objects that scatter to the
intended users is overlapped by the spread of objects that backscatter to the
base station, then spatial isolation outperforms time division, otherwise time
division may be optimal.

similar morphology to Local Volume (LV) dwarf galaxies, i.e. a blue main

depend only very weakly on the mass of the host halo. The size of the H II
region expanding into the IGM is generally limited by (super-)Lyman Limit

strong dependence of near-zone size on direction and drives the large observed
scatter. In the simulation centred on our most massive host halo, many
sightlines show strong red damping wings even for initial volume averaged
neutral hydrogen fractions as low as ~ 10$^{-3}$. For QSO lifetimes long enough

approaches based on harmonic analysis of semi-flexible polymer models have been
introduced, which offer much greater computational efficiency than Monte Carlo

However, the harmonic approximation is only applicable for small systems,

The mobile phone's accessibility and use allows us with an unprecedented volume
of data on social interactions, mobility and more. Can this data help us better
understand, characterize and alleviate poverty in one of the poorest nations in
the world. Our study is an attempt in this direction. We discuss two concepts,
which are both interconnected and immensely useful for securing the important
link between mobile accessibility and poverty.
  First, we use the cellular-communications data to construct virtual
connectivity maps for Senegal, which are then correlated with the poverty
indicators to learn a model. Our model predicts poverty index at any spatial
resolution. Thus, we generate Poverty Maps for Senegal at an unprecedented
finer resolution. Such maps are essential for understanding what characterizes
poverty in a certain region, and how it differentiates from other regions, for
targeted responses for the demographic of the population that is most needy. An
interesting fact, that is empirically proved by our methodology, is that a
large portion of all communication, and economic activity in Senegal is
concentrated in Dakar, leaving many other regions marginalized.
  Second, we study how user behavioral statistics, gathered from
cellular-communications, correlate with the poverty indicators. Can this
relationship be learnt as a model to generate poverty maps at a finer
resolution? Surprisingly, this relationship can give us an alternate poverty
map, that is solely based on the user behavior. Since poverty is a complex
phenomenon, poverty maps showcasing multiple perspectives, such as ours,
provide policymakers with better insights for effective responses for poverty
eradication.

this general framework -- denoising autoencoder and dropout, and subsequently
derive the convergence rates of deep networks. Building upon these bounds, we
provide insights into the choices of learning parameters and network sizes that
achieve certain levels of convergence accuracy. The results derived here
support existing empirical observations, and we also conduct a set of

sharing resources. Its ubiquity in nature poses a conundrum. Whenever two
entities cooperate, one must willingly relinquish something of value to the
other. Why is this apparent altruism favored in evolution? Classical solutions
assume a net fitness gain in a cooperative transaction which, through
reciprocity or relatedness, finds its way back from recipient to donor. We seek
the source of this fitness gain. Our analysis rests on the insight that
evolutionary processes are typically multiplicative and noisy. Fluctuations
have a net negative effect on the long-time growth rate of resources but no
effect on the growth rate of their expectation value. This is an example of
non-ergodicity. By reducing the amplitude of fluctuations, pooling and sharing
increases the long-time growth rate for cooperating entities, meaning that
cooperators outgrow similar non-cooperators. We identify this increase in
growth rate as the net fitness gain, consistent with the concept of geometric
mean fitness in the biological literature. This constitutes a fundamental
mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Its minimal assumptions make it a
candidate explanation of cooperation in settings too simple for other fitness
gains, such as emergent function and specialization, to be probable. One such
example is the transition from single cells to early multicellular life.

to constrain the simplest case in which a single compact axion descends from a

N-flation and some alignment models. We show that other alignment models entail
surprising consequences for how the mass spectrum of the theory varies across
the axion moduli space, and hence can be excluded if further conjectures hold.
In every case that we consider, plausible assumptions lead to field ranges that
cannot be parametrically larger than the Planck scale. Our results are strongly
suggestive of a general inconsistency in models of large-field inflation based
on compact axions, and possibly of a more general principle forbidding

also show that the anisotropy changes dramatically when considering increments
oblique to the radial directions. Both results can be understood by noting that
expansion reduces the radial component of the magnetic field at all scales,
thus confining fluctuations in the plane perpendicular to the radial. Expansion
is thus shown to affect not only the (global) spectral anisotropy, but also the
local anisotropy of second-order structure functions by influencing the

CEMP-no stars enriched by the first stellar generations should be present in
all dwarf galaxies, with similar number of stars and CEMP fractions at [Fe/H]$<

of the dwarf galaxy and, on average, it is an order of magnitude lower in

model of the flaring magnetic field configurations. Regions are selected based
on their pre-flare configurations along with the appearance and observational

features observed in extreme ultraviolet and X-ray passbands. We perform a
topology analysis of the models by computing the squashing factor, Q, in order
to determine the locations of prominent quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs). QSLs
from these maps are compared to flare ribbons at their full extents. We show
that in all cases the straight segments of the two J-shaped ribbons are matched
very well by the flux-rope-related QSLs, and the matches to the hooked segments
are less consistent but still good for most cases. In addition, we show that
these QSLs overlay ridges in the electric current density maps. This study is
the largest sample of regions with QSLs derived from 3D coronal magnetic field

half of its mass falls back to the BH at super-Eddington rates. Being tenuously
gravitationally bound and unable to cool radiatively, only a small fraction
f_in << 1 of the returning debris will likely be incorporated into the disk and
accrete, with the vast majority instead becoming unbound in an outflow of
velocity ~1e4 km/s. This slow outflow spreads laterally, encasing the BH. For
months or longer, the outflow remains sufficiently neutral to block hard EUV
and X-ray radiation from the hot inner disk, which instead becomes trapped in a
radiation-dominated nebula. Ionizing nebular radiation heats the inner edge of
the ejecta to temperatures of T > few 1e4 K, converting the emission to
optical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily escape due to the lower
opacity. This can explain the unexpectedly low and temporally constant
effective temperatures of optically-discovered TDE flares. For BHs with
relatively high masses M_BH > 1e7 M_sun the ejecta can become ionized at an
earlier stage, or for a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare
which is instead dominated by thermal X-ray emission. We predict total radiated
energies consistent with those of observed TDE flares, and ejecta velocities
that agree with the measured emission line widths. The peak optical luminosity
for M_BH < 1e6 M_sun is suppressed due to adiabatic losses in the inner disk
wind, possibly contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in
galaxies with low mass BHs. In the classical picture, where f_in ~ 1, TDEs
de-spin supermassive BHs and cap their maximum spins well below theoretical
accretion physics limits. This cap is greatly relaxed in our model, and
existing Fe K-alpha spin measurements provide suggestive preliminary evidence
that f_in < 1.

systems with confirmed planets within the Kepler field of view that could lie

Stat. Mech., P11020 (2012)]. The first essential property is that the
groundstates are mutually indistinguishable by local, symmetric probes, and the
second is a generalized notion of zero edge modes which cyclically permute the
groundstates. These two properties are shown to be topologically robust, and
applicable to a wider family of topologically-ordered Hamiltonians than has
been previously considered. An an application of these edge modes, we formulate
a new notion of twisted boundary conditions on a closed chain, which guarantees
that the closed-chain groundstate is topological, i.e., it originates from the
topological manifold of degenerate states on the open chain. Finally, we
generalize these ideas to describe symmetry-breaking phases with a
parafermionic order parameter. These exotic phases are condensates of
parafermion multiplets, which generalizes Cooper pairing in superconductors.
The stability of these condensates are investigated on both open and closed
chains.

generalised frames with a generalised Lie derivative algebra that reproduces
the embedding tensor of the $SO(4)$ and $SO(8)$ gaugings respectively. The

that extends to scales of ~ 1kpc. The majority of such objects are classified
as LINERs, but the nature of their ionizing source is still not clear. The
kinematics associated with these gaseous structures usually shows deviations
from a pure rotational motion due to non-gravitational effects or to
non-axisymmetric potentials. This is the third of a series of papers that
describes a sample of 10 nearby and massive ETG observed with the Gemini
Multi-Object Spectrograph in Integral Field mode installed on the Gemini-South
telescope. In paper II, we performed spectral synthesis to subtract the stellar
components from the data cubes of the sample galaxies in order to study their
nuclear spectra. Here, we analyse the circumnuclear gas emission (scales of ~
100 pc) of the sample galaxies. Circumnuclear gas emission was detected in
seven galaxies, all of them classified as LINERs. Pure gaseous discs are found
in three galaxies. In two objects, gaseous discs are probably present, but
their kinematics are affected by non-Keplerian motions. In IC 5181, we detected
a spiral structure of gas that may be caused either by a non-axisymmetric
potential or by an outflow together with a gaseous disc. In NGC 3136, an
ionization bicone is present in addition to five compact structures with
LINER-like emission. In galaxies with a gaseous disc, we found that ionizing
photons emitted by an AGN are not enough to explain the observed Ha flux along
this structure. On the other hand, the Ha flux distribution and equivalent
width along the direction perpendicular the gaseous disc suggest the presence
of low-velocity ionized gas emission which seem to be related to the nuclear
activity. We propose a scenario for LINER-like circumnuclear regions where a
low-velocity ionization cone is formed by a collimating agent aligned with the

properties of a wide range of interacting fermion systems, such as liquid
helium-3, nuclear matter, and electrons in metals. The d-dimensional boundaries
of (d+1)-dimensional topological phases of matter such as quantum Hall systems
and topological insulators provide new types of many-fermion systems that are
topologically distinct from conventional d-dimensional many-fermion systems. We
construct a phenomenological Landau theory for the two-dimensional helical
Fermi liquid found on the surface of a three-dimensional time-reversal
invariant topological insulator. In the presence of rotation symmetry,
interactions between quasiparticles are described by ten independent Landau
parameters per angular momentum channel, by contrast with the two (symmetric
and antisymmetric) Landau parameters for a conventional spin-degenerate Fermi
liquid. We then project quasiparticle states onto the Fermi surface and obtain
an effectively spinless, projected Landau theory with a single projected Landau
parameter per angular momentum channel that captures the spin-momentum locking
or nontrivial Berry phase of the Fermi surface. As a result of this nontrivial
Berry phase, projection to the Fermi surface can increase or lower the angular
momentum of the quasiparticle interactions. We derive equilibrium properties,
criteria for Fermi surface instabilities, and collective mode dispersions in
terms of the projected Landau parameters. We briefly discuss experimental means
of measuring projected Landau parameters.

evaluate the likelihood, but from which it is relatively easy to sample.
Approximate Bayesian computation is a likelihood-free method for implementing
Bayesian inference in such cases. We present results on the asymptotic variance
of estimators obtained using approximate Bayesian computation in a large-data
limit. Our key assumption is that the data are summarized by a
fixed-dimensional summary statistic that obeys a central limit theorem. We
prove asymptotic normality of the mean of the approximate Bayesian computation
posterior. This result also shows that, in terms of asymptotic variance, we
should use a summary statistic that is the same dimension as the parameter
vector, p; and that any summary statistic of higher dimension can be reduced,
through a linear transformation, to dimension p in a way that can only reduce
the asymptotic variance of the posterior mean. We look at how the Monte Carlo
error of an importance sampling algorithm that samples from the approximate
Bayesian computation posterior affects the accuracy of estimators. We give
conditions on the importance sampling proposal distribution such that the
variance of the estimator will be the same order as that of the maximum
likelihood estimator based on the summary statistics used. This suggests an
iterative importance sampling algorithm, which we evaluate empirically on a
stochastic volatility model.

to differ if a software system is to be tested properly and its quality
ensured. Consequently, much research has gone into formulating distance
measures for how test cases, their inputs and/or their outputs differ. However,
common to these proposals is that they are data type specific and/or calculate
the diversity only between pairs of test inputs, traces or outputs.
  We propose a new metric to measure the diversity of sets of tests: the test
set diameter (TSDm). It extends our earlier, pairwise test diversity metrics
based on recent advances in information theory regarding the calculation of the
normalized compression distance (NCD) for multisets. An advantage is that TSDm
can be applied regardless of data type and on any test-related information, not
only the test inputs. A downside is the increased computational time compared
to competing approaches.
  Our experiments on four different systems show that the test set diameter can
help select test sets with higher structural and fault coverage than random
selection even when only applied to test inputs. This can enable early test
design and selection, prior to even having a software system to test, and
complement other types of test automation and analysis. We argue that this
quantification of test set diversity creates a number of opportunities to
better understand software quality and provides practical ways to increase it.

varying width allow for modulation of the electron drift velocity while keeping
the plasma velocity constant. We predict that in such structures biased by a
constant current, a periodic modulation of the electron drift velocity due the
varying width results in the instability of the plasma waves if the electron
drift velocity to plasma wave velocity ratio changes from below to above unity.
The physics of such instability is similar to that of the sonic boom, but, in
the periodically modulated structures, this analog of the sonic boom is
repeated many times leading to a larger increment of the instability. The
constant plasma velocity in the sections of different width leads to the
resonant excitation of the unstable plasma modes with the varying bias current.
This effect (that we refer to as the super plasmonic boom condition) results in
a strong enhancement of the instability. The predicted instability involves the
oscillating dipole charge carried by the plasma waves. The plasmons can be
efficiently coupled to the terahertz (THz) electromagnetic radiation due to the
periodic geometry of the gated structure. Our estimates show that the analyzed
instability should enable powerful tunable terahertz electronic sources.

fine tuning a difficult task. In this context, we propose a novel fire

multiplicity fluctuation in high-energy nuclear collisions, built on the
earlier work of Bzdak and Teaney. The method allows the decomposition of the
centrality dependence of average multiplicity from the dynamical event-by-event
(EbyE) fluctuation of multiplicity in pseudorapidity. Application of the method
to AMPT and HIJING models shows that the long-range component of the FB
correlation is captured by a few longitudinal harmonics, with the first
component driven by the asymmetry in the number of participating nucleons in
the two colliding nuclei. The higher-order longitudinal harmonics are found to
be strongly damped in AMPT compare to HIJING, due to weaker short-range
correlations as well as the final-state effects present in the AMPT model.
Two-particle pseudorapidity correlation reveals interesting charge-dependent
short-range structures that are absent in HIJING model. The proposed method
opens an avenue to elucidate the particle production mechanism and early time
dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Future analysis directions and prospects of
using the pseudorapidity correlation function to understand the centrality bias

with gas mass measured directly with HD rotational lines, the inferred gas mass

if the elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen are reduced in the upper

enhancement of their abundances in the inner disk). The implication is that in
the outer disk, the main reservoir of the volatiles (CO, water, ...) resides
close to the midplane, locked up inside solid bodies that are too heavy to be
transported back to the atmosphere by turbulence. An enhancement in the carbon
and oxygen abundances in the inner disk can be caused by inward migration of
these solid bodies. This is consistent with estimates based on previous models

pressure dependence of the saturation level. In ideal MHD simulations, the gas
pressure dependence is found to be very sensitive to the choice of a numerical

to the scheme as well as the pressure, which considerably affects the results.
The saturation level is more sensitive to the numerical magnetic Prandtl number
than the pressure. In MHD simulations with explicit viscosity and resistivity,
the saturation level increases with the physical magnetic Prandtl number, and
it is almost independent of the gas pressure when the magnetic Prandtl number

where $\delta$ is a fixed positive real number. We prove that the abscissa of
absolute convergence of $\zeta_A$ is equal to $\overline\dim_BA$, the upper box
(or Minkowski) dimension of $A$. Particular attention is payed to the principal
complex dimensions of $A$, defined as the set of poles of $\zeta_A$ located on
the critical line $\{\mathop{\mathrm{Re}} s=\overline\dim_BA\}$, provided
$\zeta_A$ possesses a meromorphic extension to a neighborhood of the critical

$\tilde\zeta_A(s)=\int_0^{\delta} t^{s-N-1}|A_t|\,\mathrm{d} t$, called the
tube zeta function of $A$. Assuming that $A$ is Minkowski measurable, we show
that, under some mild conditions, the residue of $\tilde\zeta_A$ computed at
$D=\dim_BA$ (the box dimension of $A$), is equal to the Minkowski content of
$A$. More generally, without assuming that $A$ is Minkowski measurable, we show
that the residue is squeezed between the lower and upper Minkowski contents of
$A$. We also introduce transcendentally quasiperiodic sets, and construct a
class of such sets, using generalized Cantor sets, along with Baker's theorem

(BB) power spectrum is one of the key scientific aims of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) polarization experiments. However, this could be easily
contaminated by several foreground issues, such as the thermal dust emission.
In this paper we study another mechanism, the cosmic birefringence, which can
be introduced by a CPT-violating interaction between CMB photons and an
external scalar field. Such kind of interaction could give rise to the rotation
of the linear polarization state of CMB photons, and consequently induce the
CMB BB power spectrum, which could mimic the signal of primordial gravitational
waves at large scales. With the recent polarization data of BICEP2 and the
joint analysis data of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck, we perform a global
fitting analysis on constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by considering
the polarization rotation angle which can be separated into a background
isotropic part and a small anisotropic part. Since the data of BICEP2 and Keck
Array experiments have already been corrected by using the ""self-calibration""
method, here we mainly focus on the effects from the anisotropies of CMB
polarization rotation angle. We find that including the anisotropies in the
analysis could slightly weaken the constraints on $r$, when using current CMB
polarization measurements. We also simulate the mock CMB data with the
BICEP3-like sensitivity. Very interestingly, we find that if the effects of the
anisotropic polarization rotation angle can not be taken into account properly
in the analysis, the constraints on $r$ will be dramatically biased. This
implies that we need to break the degeneracy between the anisotropies of the
CMB polarization rotation angle and the CMB primordial tensor perturbations, in
order to measure the signal of primordial gravitational waves accurately.

is dominated by the quasi-random variation of a pulsar's emission profile from
rotation to rotation. Like measurement noise, this noise is only reduced as the
square root of observing time, posing a major challenge to future pulsar timing
campaigns with large aperture telescopes, e.g. the Five-hundred-metre Aperture
Spherical Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array.
  We propose a new method of pulsar timing that attempts to approximate the
pulse-to-pulse variability with a small family of 'basis' pulses. If pulsar
data are integrated over many rotations, this basis can be used to measure
sub-pulse structure. Or, if high-time resolution data are available, the basis
can be used to 'tag' single pulses and produce an optimal timing template. With
realistic simulations, we show that these applications can dramatically reduce
the effect of pulse-to-pulse variability on TOAs. Using high-time resolution
data taken from the bright PSR J0835-4510 (Vela), we demonstrate a 25-40%
improvement in TOA precision. Crucially for pulsar timing applications, we
further establish that these techniques produce TOAs with gaussian residuals.
  Improvements of this level halve the telescope time required to reach a
desired TOA precision. Although some gains can be achieved with existing data,
the greatest improvements result from the 'tagging' approach, which in turn
requires online or posthoc analysis of single pulses, an important
consideration for the design of future instrumentation.

in an $n$-node AVL tree takes at most two rotations, but a deletion in an

deletions can take many rotations not only in the worst case but in the
amortized case as well. A sequence of $n$ successive deletions in an $n$-node
tree takes $O(n)$ rotations, but what happens when insertions are intermixed
with deletions? Heaupler, Sen, and Tarjan conjectured that alternating
insertions and deletions in an $n$-node AVL tree can cause each deletion to do
$\Omega(\log n)$ rotations, but they provided no construction to justify their
claim. We provide such a construction: we show that, for infinitely many $n$,
there is a set $E$ of {\it expensive} $n$-node AVL trees with the property
that, given any tree in $E$, deleting a certain leaf and then reinserting it
produces a tree in $E$, with the deletion having done $\Theta(\log n)$
rotations. One can do an arbitrary number of such expensive deletion-insertion
pairs. The difficulty in obtaining such a construction is that in general the
tree produced by an expensive deletion-insertion pair is not the original tree.
Indeed, if the trees in $E$ have even height $k$, $2^{k/2}$ deletion-insertion
pairs are required to reproduce the original tree.

gravity theories and possible dark matter interactions. We measure the
quadrupole weak lensing signal from the elliptical halos of 70,000 SDSS
Luminous Red Galaxies. We use a new estimator that nulls the spherical halo
lensing signal, isolating the shear due to anisotropy in the dark matter
distribution. One of the two Cartesian components of our estimator is
insensitive to the primary systematic, a spurious alignment of lens and source
ellipticities, allowing us to make robust measurements of halo ellipticity. Our
best-fit value for the ellipticity of the surface mass density is $0.24 \pm
0.06$, which translates to an axis ratio of 0.78. We rule out the hypothesis of
no ellipticity at the $4\sigma$ confidence level, and ellipticity < 0.12 (axis
ratio > 0.89) at the $2\sigma$ level. We discuss how our measurements of halo
ellipticity are revised to higher values using estimates of the misalignment of
mass and light from simulations. Finally, we apply the same techniques to a
smaller sample of redMaPPer galaxy clusters and obtain a $3\sigma$ measurement
of cluster ellipticity. We discuss how the improved signal to noise properties
of our estimator can enable studies of halo shapes for different galaxy
populations with upcoming surveys.

Random Fields. We are particularly interested in approximating pairwise
densities whose logarithm belongs to a Sobolev space. For this problem we
propose the method of exponential series [Crain, 1974; Barron and Sheu, 1991],
which approximates the log density by a finite- dimensional exponential family
with the number of sufficient statistics increasing with the sample size. We
consider two approaches to estimating these models. The first is regularized
maximum likelihood. This involves optimizing the sum of the log-likelihood of
the data and a sparsity-inducing regularizer. We provide consistency and edge
selection guarantees for this method. We then propose a variational
approximation to the likelihood based on tree- reweighted, nonparametric
message passing.
  We then consider estimation using regularized score matching. This approach
uses an alternative scoring rule to the log-likelihood, which obviates the need
to compute the normalizing constant of the distribution. For general
continuous-valued exponential families, we provide parameter and edge
consistency results. We then describe results for model selection in the
nonparametric pairwise model using exponential series. The regularized score
matching problem is shown to be a convex program; we provide scalable
algorithms based on consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM, [Boyd et al., 2011]) and Coordinate-wise Descent. We compare our method
to others in the literature as well as the aforementioned TRW estimator using
simulated data.

and the molecular dynamics calculations. An atomistic method for calculating
the total Peierls energy map has been devised to track the transition path of a
dissociated and/or constricted screw $<$a$>$ dislocation in the cross-slip
process. The barrier of a screw $<$a$>$ dislocation from the basal to the
prismatic plane is estimated by the density functional theory for the first
time to be $61.4\pm 2.0$ meV per Burgers vector length. The activation enthalpy
for the cross slip is calculated using a line tension model based on the
density functional theory to be $1.4$ to $1.7$ eV, which is in reasonable
agreement with experiments. On the basis of the results, the effect of
temperature on the cross-slip process of the dissociated screw $<$a$>$
dislocation on the basal plane is studied in detail using the molecular
dynamics method with the embedded-atom-method (EAM) interatomic potential, in
which the critical resolved shear stress for the cross slip is evaluated. It is
confirmed that the bowed-out dislocation line on the prismatic plane consists
of slightly dissociated rectilinear segments with connecting jogs at low
temperatures and, as the temperature rises, the curved dislocation line becomes
smooth with many segments. The motion of an $<$a$>$ dislocation on the
prismatic plane is jerky in the low temperature region, while it is retarded by
the formation of the largely dissociated plateau segment above the room
temperature. A large reduction of the critical shear stress for the cross slip
is obtained when the $<$a$>$ screw dislocation interacts with a hard-sphere
particle placed on the basal plane in the low temperature region

of up to $8$-qubit entanglement in a D-Wave quantum annealing device. However,
entanglement was measured using qubit tunneling spectroscopy, a technique that
provides indirect access to the state of the system at intermediate times
during the anneal by performing measurements at the end of the anneal with a
probe qubit. In addition, an underlying assumption was that the quantum
transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, whose ground states are already highly
entangled, is an appropriate model of the device, and not some other (possibly
classical) model. This begs the question of whether alternative, classical or
semiclassical models would be equally effective at predicting the observed
spectrum and thermal state populations. To check this, we consider a recently
proposed classical rotor model with classical Monte Carlo updates, which has
been successfully employed in describing features of earlier experiments
involving the device. We also consider simulated quantum annealing with quantum
Monte Carlo updates, an algorithm that samples from the instantaneous Gibbs
state of the device Hamiltonian. Finally, we use the quantum adiabatic master
equation, which cannot be efficiently simulated classically, and which has
previously been used to successfully capture the open system quantum dynamics
of the device. We find that only the master equation is able to reproduce the
features of the tunneling spectroscopy experiment, while both the classical
rotor model and simulated quantum annealing fail to reproduce the experimental
results. We argue that this bolsters the evidence for the reported
entanglement.

the robots may not all be aware of each other, which is often the case in
distributed systems. As a result, DisCoF represents an inherently online
approach since coordination can only be realized in an opportunistic manner
between robots that are within each other's sensing and communication range.
However, there are a few assumptions made in DisCoF to facilitate a formal
analysis, which must be removed to work with distributed multi-robot platforms.
In this paper, we present DisCoF$^+$, which extends DisCoF by enabling an

configurations on anisotropic backgrounds playing a prominent role in the
non-relativistic version of the gauge/gravity correspondence. By stealth
configuration, we mean a nontrivial scalar field nonminimally coupled to

vanishes identically. In the case of a Lifshitz spacetime with a nontrivial
dynamical exponent z, we spotlight the role played by the anisotropy to
establish the holographic character of the stealth configurations, i.e. the
scalar field is shown to only depend on the radial holographic direction. This
configuration which turns out to be massless and without integration constants
is possible for a unique value of the nonminimal coupling parameter. Then,
using a simple conformal argument, we map this configuration into a stealth
solution defined on the so-called hyperscaling violation metric which is
conformally related to the Lifshitz spacetime. This holographic configuration
obtained through a conformal mapping constitutes only a particular class within
the stealth solutions defined on the hyperscaling violation as it is shown by
deriving the most general stealth configurations. The case of the Schrodinger
background is also exhaustively analyzed and we establish that the presence of
the null direction makes their stealth configurations not necessarily
holographic in general and characterized by a self-interacting behavior.
Finally, for completeness we also study the stealth configurations on the
Schrodinger inspired hyperscaling violation spacetimes.

escape and formation of planetary inner magnetosphere in a comprehensive way,
we start with a hydrodynamic model of an upper atmosphere expansion presented
in this paper. While considering a simple hydrogen atmosphere model, we focus
on selfconsistent inclusion of the effects of radiative heating and ionization
of the atmospheric gas with its consequent expansion in the outer space.
Primary attention is paid to investigation of the role of specific conditions
at the inner and outer boundaries of the simulation domain, under which
different regimes of material escape (free- and restricted- flow) are formed.
Comparative study of different processes, such as XUV heating, material
ionization and recombination, H3+ cooling, adiabatic and Lyman-alpha cooling,
Lyman-alpha reabsorption is performed. We confirm basic consistence of the
outcomes of our modeling with the results of other hydrodynamic models of
expanding planetary atmospheres. In particular, we obtain that under the
typical conditions of an orbital distance 0.05 AU around a Sun-type star a Hot
Jupiter plasma envelope may reach maximum temperatures up to ~9000K with a
hydrodynamic escape speed ~9 km/s resulting in the mass loss rates ~(4-7)*10^10
g*s . In the range of considered stellar-planetary parameters and XUV fluxes
that is close to mass loss in the energy limited case. The inclusion of
planetary intrinsic magnetic fields in the model is a subject of the following

accommodate ever increasing demands of resource-limited embedded and mobile
devices. Thanks to the availability of recent high data rate millimeter-wave
frequency spectrum such as 60GHz and due to the favorable attributes of this
technology, wireless DC (WDC) exhibits the potentials of being a promising
solution especially for small to medium scale DCs. This paper investigates the
problem of throughput scalability of WDCs using the established theory of the
asymptotic throughput of wireless multi-hop networks that are primarily
proposed for homogeneous traffic conditions. The rate-heterogeneous traffic
distribution of a data center however, requires the asymptotic heterogeneous
throughput knowledge of a wireless network in order to study the performance
and feasibility of WDCs for practical purposes. To answer these questions this
paper presents a lower bound for the throughput scalability of a multi-hop
rate-heterogeneous network when traffic generation rates of all nodes are
similar, except one node. We demonstrate that the throughput scalability of
conventional multi-hopping and the spatial reuse of the above bi-rate network
is inefficient and henceforth develop a speculative 2-partitioning scheme that
improves the network throughput scaling potentials. A better lower bound of the
throughput is then obtained. Finally, we obtain the throughput scaling of an
i.i.d. rate-heterogeneous network and obtain its lower bound. Again we propose
a speculative 2-partitioning scheme to achieve a network with higher throughput
in terms of improved lower bound. All of the obtained results have been

system failure. Cut Set Analysis (CSA) is applied to critical systems to
identify and rank system vulnerabilities at design time. Model checking tools
have been used to automate the generation of minimal cut sets but are generally
based on checking reachability of system failure states. This paper describes a
new approach to CSA using a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) model checker called BT
Analyser that supports the generation of multiple counterexamples. The approach
enables a broader class of system failures to be analysed, by generalising from
failure state formulae to failure behaviours expressed in LTL. The traditional
approach to CSA using model checking requires the model or system failure to be
modified, usually by hand, to eliminate already-discovered cut sets, and the
model checker to be rerun, at each step. By contrast, the new approach works
incrementally and fully automatically, thereby removing the tedious and
error-prone manual process and resulting in significantly reduced computation
time. This in turn enables larger models to be checked. Two different
strategies for using BT Analyser for CSA are presented. There is generally no
single best strategy for model checking: their relative efficiency depends on
the model and property being analysed. Comparative results are given for the
A320 hydraulics case study in the Behavior Tree modelling language.

techniques are valuable since they allow to handle even more complex systems.
One key point is the ability to decompose a large system into subsystems,
analyze those subsystems and deduce properties of the larger system. As
cyber-physical systems tend to become more and more complex, such techniques
become more appealing.
  In 2009, Oehlerking and Theel presented a (de-)composition technique for
hybrid systems. This technique is graph-based and constructs a Lyapunov
function for hybrid systems having a complex discrete state space. The
technique consists of (1) decomposing the underlying graph of the hybrid system
into subgraphs, (2) computing multiple local Lyapunov functions for the
subgraphs, and finally (3) composing the local Lyapunov functions into a
piecewise Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function can serve multiple purposes,
e.g., it certifies stability or termination of a system or allows to construct
invariant sets, which in turn may be used to certify safety and security.
  In this paper, we propose an improvement to the decomposing technique, which
relaxes the graph structure before applying the decomposition technique. Our
relaxation significantly reduces the connectivity of the graph by exploiting
super-dense switching. The relaxation makes the decomposition technique more
efficient on one hand and on the other allows to decompose a wider range of
graph structures.

writing high-level specifications: indexed events and synchronous events.
Indexed events allow for concise description of behaviour common to a set of
actors. The indexing construct allows us to select a specific actor and to
specify a temporal property for that actor. We use indexed events to validate
the requirements of a train control system. Synchronous events allow developers
to decompose simultaneous state updates into actions of separate events. To
specify the intended data flow among synchronized actions, we use primed
variables to reference the post-state (i.e., one resulted from taking the
synchronized actions). The TTM tool automatically infers the data flow from
synchronous events, and reports errors on inconsistencies due to circular data
flow. We use synchronous events to validate part of the requirements of a

facilitates the formal validation of system requirements, and use the TTM tool

parameters (mass ratios, separations and eccentricities) are indispensable
input for simulations of stellar populations. It is often claimed that these
are poorly constrained significantly affecting evolutionary predictions.
Recently, dedicated observing campaigns provided new constraints on the initial
conditions for massive stars. Findings include a larger close binary fraction
and a stronger preference for very tight systems. We investigate the impact on
the predicted merger rates of neutron stars and black holes.
  Despite the changes with previous assumptions, we only find an increase of
less than a factor 2 (insignificant compared with evolutionary uncertainties of
typically a factor 10-100). We further show that the uncertainties in the new
initial binary properties do not significantly affect (within a factor of 2)
our predictions of double compact object merger rates. An exception is the
uncertainty in IMF (variations by a factor of 6 up and down). No significant
changes in the distributions of final component masses, mass ratios, chirp
masses and delay times are found.
  We conclude that the predictions are, for practical purposes, robust against
uncertainties in the initial conditions concerning binary parameters with
exception of the IMF. This eliminates an important layer of the many uncertain
assumptions affecting the predictions of merger detection rates with the

the computed $S({\bf q},\omega)$ in the random-singlet state depends on the

accompnied by the broad distribution extending to higher energy $\omega$.
Especially in the strongly random kagome model, $S({\bf q},\omega)$ hardly
depends on ${\bf q}$, and exhibits an almost flat distribution for a wide range
of $\omega$, together with a $\omega=0$ peak. These features agree
semi-quantitatively with the recent neutron-scattering data on a single-crystal
herbertsmithite, suggesting that the QSL state observed in herbersmithite might
indeed be the randomness-induced QSL state, {\it i.e.\/}, the random-singlet

to the difficulty in characterizing the tip, and in particular a lack of
reliable methods that can achieve this in situ. Here, we provide an in situ
method to characterize the tip radius and monitor tip creep and/or wear and
biomolecular sample wear in ambient dynamic AFM. This is achieved by monitoring
the dynamics of the cantilever and the critical free amplitude to observe a
switch from the attractive to the repulsive regime. The method is exemplified
on the mechanically heterogeneous sample of single DNA molecules bound to mica
mineral surfaces. Simultaneous monitoring of apparent height and width of
single DNA molecules while detecting variations in the tip radius R as small as
one nanometer are demonstrated. The yield stress can be readily exceeded for
sharp tips (R<10 nm) at typical operating amplitudes (A>10nm). The ability to

gap exhibits transitions from p-wave at very low electron fillings to
d_{x^2-y^2}-wave symmetry close to half filling in agreement with previous
reports. At intermediate filling levels, different gap symmetries appear as a
consequence of the changes in the Fermi surface topology and the associated
structure of the spin susceptibility. In particular, the vicinity of a van Hove
singularity in the electronic structure close to the Fermi level has important
consequences for the gap structure in favoring the otherwise sub-dominant
triplet solution over the singlet d-wave solution. By solving the full gap
equation, we find that the energetically favorable triplet solutions are chiral
and break time reversal symmetry. Finally, we also calculate the detailed
angular gap structure of the quasi-particle spectrum, and show how

different products exported by 148 countries. We have found that the form of
these distributions is not unique but heavily depends on the level of
development of the nation, as expressed by macroeconomic indicators like GDP,
GDP per capita, total export and a recently introduced measure for countries'
economic complexity called fitness. We have identified three major classes: a)
an incomplete log-normal shape, truncated on the left side, for the less
developed countries, b) a complete log-normal, with a wider range of volumes,
for nations characterized by intermediate economy, and c) a strongly asymmetric
shape for countries with a high degree of development. The ranking curves of
the exported volumes from each country seldom cross each other, showing a clear
hierarchy of export volumes. Finally, the log-normality hypothesis has been
checked for the distributions of all the 148 countries through different tests,
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-Von Mises, confirming that it cannot be rejected
only for the countries of intermediate economy.

a family of circles. These circles are not artificially added ones but stem
from the equations of motion, while their radii are inversely proportional to
the square root of the cosmological parameter. The other discovery is that, on
any circle, there symmetrically distribute four branes. Their tensions, $V_1

  Complex Behaviors of Walking Robots","26 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.NE cs.RO q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Walking animals, like stick insects, cockroaches or ants, demonstrate a
fascinating range of locomotive abilities and complex behaviors. The locomotive
behaviors can consist of a variety of walking patterns along with adaptation
that allow the animals to deal with changes in environmental conditions, like
uneven terrains, gaps, obstacles etc. Biological study has revealed that such
complex behaviors are a result of a combination of biome- chanics and neural
mechanism thus representing the true nature of embodied interactions. While the
biomechanics helps maintain flexibility and sustain a variety of movements, the
neural mechanisms generate movements while making appropriate predictions
crucial for achieving adaptation. Such predictions or planning ahead can be
achieved by way of in- ternal models that are grounded in the overall behavior
of the animal. Inspired by these findings, we present here, an artificial
bio-inspired walking system which effectively com- bines biomechanics (in terms
of the body and leg structures) with the underlying neural mechanisms. The
neural mechanisms consist of 1) central pattern generator based control for
generating basic rhythmic patterns and coordinated movements, 2) distributed
(at each leg) recurrent neural network based adaptive forward models with
efference copies as internal models for sensory predictions and instantaneous
state estimations, and 3) searching and elevation control for adapting the
movement of an individual leg to deal with different environmental conditions.
Using simulations we show that this bio-inspired approach with adaptive
internal models allows the walking robot to perform complex loco- motive
behaviors as observed in insects, including walking on undulated terrains,
crossing large gaps as well as climbing over high obstacles...

of the neutron star (NS) magnetic field and spin period. It is shown that the
luminosity can reach values of the order of $10^{40}\,{\rm erg/s}$ for the
magnetar-like magnetic field ($B\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm G}$) and long spin
periods ($P\gtrsim 1.5\,{\rm s}$). The relative narrowness of an area of
feasible NS parameters which are able to provide higher luminosities leads to
the conclusion that $L\simeq 10^{40}\,\,{\rm erg/s}$ is a good estimate for the
limiting accretion luminosity of a NS. Because this luminosity coincides with
the cut-off observed in the high mass X-ray binaries luminosity function which
otherwise does not show any features at lower luminosities, we can conclude
that a substantial part of ultra-luminous X-ray sources are accreting neutron

stream energy projects. Many hydrodynamic models incorporate the effect of

although for coarse grid resolutions (kilometre scale) the resulting force
exerted on the flow agrees well with the theoretical value, the force starts
decreasing with decreasing grid sizes when these become smaller than the length
scale of the wake recovery. This is because the assumption that the upstream
velocity can be approximated by the local model velocity, is no longer valid.
Using linear momentum actuator disc theory however, we derive a relationship
between these two velocities and formulate a correction to the enhanced bottom
drag formulation that consistently applies a force that remains closed to the
theoretical value, for all grid sizes down to the turbine scale. In addition, a
better understanding of the relation between the model, upstream, and actual
turbine velocity, as predicted by actuator disc theory, leads to an improved
estimate of the usefully extractable energy. We show how the corrections can be
applied (demonstrated here for the models MIKE 21 and Fluidity) by a simple
modification of the drag coefficient.

different classes, for example spectra from healthy patients vs. spectra from
patients having a particular disease. Machine learning algorithms are needed to
(a) identify these discriminating features and (b) classify unknown spectra
based on this feature set. Since the acquired data is usually noisy, the
algorithms should be robust against noise and outliers, while the identified
feature set should be as small as possible.
  Results: We present a new algorithm, Sparse Proteomics Analysis (SPA), based
on the theory of compressed sensing that allows us to identify a minimal
discriminating set of features from mass spectrometry data-sets. We show (1)
how our method performs on artificial and real-world data-sets, (2) that its
performance is competitive with standard (and widely used) algorithms for
analyzing proteomics data, and (3) that it is robust against random and
systematic noise. We further demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to
two previously published clinical data-sets.

that the strength of the low-frequency component (< 0.1 Hz) decreases with

increase with energy. In the context of the propagating fluctuations model for
X-ray variability, we suggest that the low-frequency component originates in
the accretion disk (which dominates emission below ~ 2 keV) and the higher
frequency components are formed in the hot flow (which dominates emission above
~ 2 keV). As the properties of the QPO suggest that it may have a different
driving mechanism, we investigate the Lense-Thirring precession of the hot flow

policy is a complex object that has to prescribe what actions to take all over
the state space. This is especially true in large domains with complicated
dynamics. It is also computationally inefficient to both learn and plan in MDPs
using a complex monolithic approach. We present a different approach where we
restrict the policy space to policies that can be represented as combinations
of simpler, parameterized skills---a type of temporally extended action, with a
simple policy representation. We introduce Learning Skills via Bootstrapping
(LSB) that can use a broad family of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms as
a ""black box"" to iteratively learn parametrized skills. Initially, the learned
skills are short-sighted but each iteration of the algorithm allows the skills
to bootstrap off one another, improving each skill in the process. We prove
that this bootstrapping process returns a near-optimal policy. Furthermore, our

of the largest flares in X-rays since the past decade. Aim: To study all
multiwavelength data available during MJD 56392 to 56403, with special emphasis
on X-ray data, and understand the underlying particle energy distribution.
Methods: We study the correlations between the UV and gamma bands with the
X-ray band using the z-transformed discrete correlation function. We model the
underlying particle spectrum with a single population of electrons emitting
synchrotron radiation, and do a statistical fitting of the simultaneous,
time-resolved data from the Swift-XRT and the NuSTAR. Results: There was rapid
flux variability in the X-ray band, with a minimum doubling timescale of $1.69
\pm 0.13$ hrs. There were no corresponding flares in UV and gamma bands. The
variability in UV and gamma rays are relatively modest with $ \sim 8 \% $ and
$\sim 16 \% $ respectively, and no significant correlation was found with the
X-ray light curve. The observed X-ray spectrum shows clear curvature which can
be fit by a log parabolic spectral form. This is best explained to originate
from a log parabolic electron spectrum. However, a broken power law or a power
law with an exponentially falling electron distribution cannot be ruled out
either. Moreover, the excellent broadband spectrum from $0.3-79$ keV allows us
to make predictions of the UV flux. We find that this prediction is compatible
with the observed flux during the low state in X-rays. However, during the
X-ray flares, the predicted flux is a factor of $2-50$ smaller than the
observed one. This suggests that the X-ray flares are plausibly caused by a
separate population which does not contribute significantly to the radiation at
lower energies. Alternatively, the underlying particle spectrum can be much
more complex than the ones explored in this work.

Standard Model (MSSM), called the TNMSSM, containing a $SU(2)$ Higgs triplet
$(\hat{T})$ of $Y=0$ hypercharge and a singlet superfields $(\hat{S})$ in the
corresponding superpotential. The model can be viewed, equivalently, as an
extension of the NMSSM with the addition of a $\hat{T}-\hat{S}$ interaction and
of an extra coupling of the triplet to the two Higgs doublets of the NMSSM. In
this scenario the Higgs particle spectrum at tree-level gets additional mass
contributions from the triplet and singlet scalar components respect to the
MSSM, which are particularly enhanced at low $\tan{\beta}$. We calculate the
one-loop Higgs masses for the neutral physical Higgs bosons by a
Coleman-Weinberg effective potential approach. In particular, we investigate
separately the impact of the radiative corrections due to the electroweak,
gauge-gaugino-higgsino, fermion-sfermion and Higgs self-interactions to the
Higgs masses. Due to the larger number of scalars and of triplet and singlet
couplings, the Higgs corrections can be larger than the strong corrections.
This reduces the amount of fine-tuning required to fit the recent Higgs data.
Using the expressions of the beta-functions of the model, we show that the
large triplet singlet coupling remains perturbative up to $\sim10^{8-10}$ GeV.
The model is also characterized by a light pseudoscalar in the spectrum, which
is a linear combination of the triplet, doublet and singlet CP-odd components.
We discuss the production and decay signatures of the Higgs bosons in this
model, including scenarios with hidden Higgses, which could be investigated at
the LHC in the current run.

associated stabilizer matrix defined by the mixed graph. We can interpret this
matrix as a quantum object by making it part of a larger fully commuting
matrix, i.e. where we choose the environment appropriately, and this will imply
that our quantum object is a mixed state.
  We prove that, in the same way as (pure) graph states, the density matrix of
a parent of mixed graph state can be written as sum of a few Pauli matrices,
well defined from the mixed graph. We have proven that the set of matrices that
appear in this sum is fully pair-wise commuting, and form a multiplicative
group up to global constants, which is always of maximum size. Furthermore, the
cardinality of the set depends solely of the miminum possible number of
extension columns/rows, and the number of nodes of the mixed graph. We prove a
formula for this cardinality. Finally, in the case of purely undirected graphs,
this corresponds to the usual pure graph state.

can create high energy photons and electrons while operating within the
quasi-static regime, and 2) detection systems that can detect the generated
high energy particles and image the entire momentum space of the interaction in
full coincidence. Here we present a unique combination of these two essential
ingredients, namely a 160\~kHz mid-IR source and a reaction microscope
detection system, to present an experimental methodology that provides an
unprecedented three-dimensional view of strong-field interactions. The system
is capable of generating and detecting electron energies that span a six order
of magnitude dynamic range. We demonstrate the versatility of the system by
investigating electron recollisions, the core process that drives strong-field
phenomena, at both low (meV) and high (hundreds of eV) energies. The low energy
region is used to investigate recently discovered low-energy structures, while
the high energy electrons are used to probe atomic structure via laser-induced
electron diffraction. Moreover we present, for the first time, the correlated
momentum distribution of electrons from non-sequential double-ionization driven
by mid-IR pulses.

including earthquakes and landslides. There is accumulating evidence that the
yielding transition between a flowing and an arrested phase is a critical
phenomenon, but the associated exponents are not understood, even at a
mean-field level where the validity of popular models is debated. Here we solve
a mean-field model that captures the broad distribution of the mechanical noise
generated by plasticity, whose behavior is related to biased L\'evy flights
near an absorbing boundary. We compute the exponent $\theta$ characterising the
density of shear transformation $P(x)\sim x^{\theta}$, where $x$ is the stress
increment beyond which they yield. We find that after an isotropic thermal
quench, $\theta=1/2$. However, $\theta$ depends continuously on the applied
shear stress, this dependence is not monotonic, and its value at the yield
stress is not universal. The model rationalizes previously unexplained
observations, and captures reasonably well the value of exponents in three
dimensions. Values of exponents in four dimensions are accurately predicted.
These results support that it is the true mean-field model that applies in
large dimension, and raise fundamental questions on the nature of the yielding
transition.

information or diseases propagate in a population, human interactions are the
subject of many data collection efforts. To this aim, different methods are
commonly used, from diaries and surveys to wearable sensors. These methods show
advantages and limitations but are rarely compared in a given setting. As
surveys targeting friendship relations might suffer less from memory biases
than contact diaries, it is also interesting to explore how daily contact
patterns compare with friendship relations and with online social links. Here
we make progresses in these directions by leveraging data from a French high
school: face-to-face contacts measured by two concurrent methods, sensors and
diaries; self-reported friendship surveys; Facebook links. We compare the data
sets and find that most short contacts are not reported in diaries while long
contacts have larger reporting probability, with a general tendency to
overestimate durations. Measured contacts corresponding to reported friendship
can have durations of any length but all long contacts correspond to reported
friendships. Online links not associated to reported friendships correspond to
short face-to-face contacts, highlighting the different nature of reported
friendships and online links. Diaries and surveys suffer from a low sampling
rate, showing the higher acceptability of sensor-based platform. Despite the
biases, we found that the overall structure of the contact network, i.e., the
mixing patterns between classes, is correctly captured by both self-reported
contacts and friendships networks. Overall, diaries and surveys tend to yield a
correct picture of the structural organization of the contact network, albeit
with much less links, and give access to a sort of backbone of the contact
network corresponding to the strongest links in terms of cumulative durations.

fidelity of unitary operations [H.F. Hofmann, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 160504

mutually unbiased bases. Determination of these bounds therefore requires much
less measurements than full quantum process tomography. We find that it is
particularly suitable to construct one of the probe basis from the right
eigenstates of K, because in this case the bounds are tight in the sense that
if the actual filter coincides with the ideal one then both the lower and upper
bounds are equal to one. We theoretically investigate application of these
bounds to a two-qubit optical quantum filter formed by interference of two
photons on a partially polarizing beam splitter. For experimentally convenient
choice of factorized input states and measurements we study the tightness of
the bounds. We show that more stringent bounds can be obtained by more
sophisticated processing of the data using convex optimization and we compare
our methods for different choice of the input probe states.

(OP). Using an upper bound on the locally accessible information for bipartite

locally distinguishable. This condition is seen to be stronger than the OP

condition for the local distinguishability of all sets of four generalized Bell
states in $\mathbb{C}^{4}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{4}$, we find that it is not only

demonstrates that the aforementioned upper-bound may play a significant role in
the general scenario of local distinguishability of bipartite states.

balancing the competing demands of expressivity and simplicity. We prove that
such auctions have small representation error, in the sense that for every
product distribution $F$ over bidders' valuations, there exists a $t$-level
auction with small $t$ and expected revenue close to optimal. We show that the
set of $t$-level auctions has modest pseudo-dimension (for polynomial $t$) and
therefore leads to small learning error. One consequence of our results is
that, in arbitrary single-parameter settings, one can learn a mechanism with
expected revenue arbitrarily close to optimal from a polynomial number of
samples.

account of wave propagation in random media, have recently emerged as a major
theme in theoretical and applied optics. Here we demonstrate, both analytically
and numerically, that in quasi one-dimensional ($1$D) diffusive samples, their
behavior is governed mostly by the asymmetry in the reflections of the sample
edges rather than by the absolute values of the reflection coefficients
themselves. We show that there exists a threshold value of the asymmetry
parameter, below which high transmission eigenchannels exist, giving rise to a
singularity in the distribution of the transmission eigenvalues, $\rho({\cal
T}\rightarrow 1)\sim(1-{\cal T})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. At the threshold, $\rho({\cal
T})$ exhibits critical statistics with a distinct singularity $\sim(1-{\cal
T})^{-\frac{1}{3}}$; above it the high transmission eigenchannels disappear and
$\rho({\cal T})$ vanishes for ${\cal T}$ exceeding a maximal transmission
eigenvalue. We show that such statistical behavior of the transmission
eigenvalues can be explained in terms of effective cavities (resonators),
analogous to those in which the states are trapped in $1$D strong Anderson
localization. In particular, the $\rho ( \mathcal{T}) $-transition can be
mapped onto the shuffling of the resonator with perfect transmittance from the
sample center to the edge with stronger reflection. We also find a similar
transition in the distribution of resonant transmittances in $1$D layered
samples. These results reveal a physical connection between high transmission
eigenchannels in diffusive systems and $1$D strong Anderson localization. They
open up a fresh opportunity for practically useful application: controlling the
transparency of opaque media by tuning their coupling to the environment.

listeners benefit from across-frequency processing, as seen with improved ITD
thresholds when consistent ITD cues are presented over a range of frequency
channels compared to when ITD information is only presented in a single
frequency channel. This study aimed to clarify whether cochlear-implant (CI)
listeners can make use of similar processing when being stimulated with
multiple interaural electrode pairs transmitting consistent ITD information.
ITD thresholds for unmodulated, 100-pulse-per-second pulse trains were measured
in seven bilateral CI listeners using research interfaces. Consistent ITDs were
presented at either one or two electrode pairs at different current levels,
allowing for comparisons at either constant level per component electrode or
equal overall loudness. Different tonotopic distances between the pairs were
tested in order to clarify the potential influence of channel interaction.
Comparison of ITD thresholds between double pairs and the respective single
pairs revealed systematic effects of tonotopic separation and current level. At
constant levels, performance with double-pair stimulation improved compared to
single-pair stimulation, but only for large tonotopic separation. Comparisons
at equal overall loudness revealed no benefit from presenting ITD information
at two electrode pairs for any tonotopic spacing. Irrespective of
electrode-pair configuration, ITD sensitivity improved with increasing current
level. Hence, the improved ITD sensitivity for double pairs found for a large
tonotopic separation and constant current levels seems to be due to increased
loudness. The overall data suggest that CI listeners can benefit from combining
consistent ITD information across multiple electrodes, provided sufficient
stimulus levels and that stimulating electrode pairs are widely spaced.

corners lead to additional (negative) logarithmic corrections with a prefactor
$l^{c}_q$ which does depend on both $n_G$ and the R\'enyi index $q$, in good
agreement with scalar field theory predictions. By varying the second neighbor
coupling $J_2$ we also explore universality across the N\'eel ordered side of

$0<J_2/J_1<1/2$ where the area law term is maximal, to the strongly

$S_q=\frac{n_G}{2}\ln N$, thus recovering the mean-field limit for a subsystem

dissipation effect and the solution is rapidly attracted to the class of ""2.5

analysis contains perturbations that experience a transient growth of kinetic
energy from $O(\textbf{Re}^{-1})$ to $O(c_0)$ due to the algebraic linear
instability known as the lift-up effect. Furthermore, solutions can exhibit a
direct cascade of energy to small scales. The behavior is very different from
the 2D Couette flow, in which stability is independent of $\textbf{Re}$,
enstrophy experiences a direct cascade, and inviscid damping is dominant
(resulting in a kind of inverse energy cascade). In 3D, inviscid damping will
play a role on one component of the velocity, but the primary stability
mechanism is the mixing-enhanced dissipation. Central to the proof is a
detailed analysis of the interplay between the stabilizing effects of the
mixing and enhanced dissipation and the destabilizing effects of the lift-up
effect, vortex stretching, and weakly nonlinear instabilities connected to the
non-normal nature of the linearization.

decades, especially due to its application in quantum computing. In the
construction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly
used to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic
gates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and
Fredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be
expensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla
bits a practical topic.
  This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single
base gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of
the 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three
main results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can
generate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated
Toffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations
using no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative
reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known
result for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known
result for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is
trivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove
their optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible
gates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate
all n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We
also explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new
concept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate
all n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an
unlimited number of borrowed bits.

an upper limit on $\rho _{0}$ for each individual galaxy, which we call here
$\rho _{0}^{\text{upper}}$, such that stable circular orbits are possible

most pulsars that we known. The mechanism giving rise to this kind of
phenomenon is uncertain, although a large data set has been built. In the
framework of star-quake model, based on~\cite{Baym1971}, the glitch-sizes (the
relative increases of spin-frequencies during glitches) $\Delta \Omega/\Omega$
depend on the released energies during glitches, with less released energies
corresponding to smaller glitch sizes. On the other hand, as one of dark matter
candidates, our Galaxy might be filled with the so called strange nuggets (SNs)
which are the relics from the early Universe. In this case the collisions
between pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to
glitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down
process. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the
accumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches
without SNs. Therefore, if a pulsar is hit frequently by SNs, it would tend to
have more small size glitches, whose values of $\Delta \Omega/\Omega$ are
smaller than that in standard star-quake model (with larger amounts of released
energy). Based on the assumption that in our Galaxy the distribution of SNs is
similar to that of dark matter, as well as on the glitch data in ATNF Pulsar
Catalogue and Jodrell Bank glitch table, we find that in our Galaxy the
incidences of small size glitches exhibit tendencies consistent with the
collision rates of pulsars and strange nuggets. Further test of this scenario
is expected by detecting more small glitches (e.g., by the Square Kilometre
Array).

multiple periodic recurrence equations. Among other things, we discuss in
detail the cases with periodic and multi-periodic coefficients, highlighting in
particular the theorems of Floquet type. For this aim, we find specific forms
for the fundamental matrix. Explicitly monodromy matrix is given, and its
eigenvalues (called Floquet multipliers) are shown. The Floquet point of view
brings about an important simplification: the initial linear multiple
recurrence system is reduced to another linear multiple recurrence system, with
constant coefficients along partial directions. The results are applied to the
discrete multitime Samuelson-Hicks models with constant, respectively
multi-periodic, coefficients, in order to find bivariate sequences with
economic meaning.

circumstances involving simple bitwise operations between real numbers. A
theory is presented for all deterministic bitwise operations on a finite
alphabet. It is shown that these models give rise to a roughness exponent $H$
that shapes the resulting spatial patterns, larger values of the exponent
leading to coarser surfaces.

"1507.01447","Karl Levy","Kurt Mahler, translated from the German by Karl Levy","A Proof of the Thue-Siegel Theorem about the Approximation of Algebraic
  Numbers for Binomial Equations",,,,,"math.HO math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1908 Thue (1) showed that algebraic numbers of the special form $\xi
=\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}}$ can, for every positive $\epsilon$, only be sharply
approximated by finitely many rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ with the following
inequality holding \[ \left|\xi -\frac{p}{q}\right|\leq
q^{-(\frac{n}{2}+1+\epsilon)} .\] The proof uses, if perhaps in a somewhat
hidden way, the continued fraction expansion of the binomial series
$(1-z)^\omega$. In further work about the approximation of algebraic numbers
(2,3) famously Thue used instead a completely different tool, the drawer method
of Dirichlet, and showed further that the above statement holds for any
algebraic number. Thue's methods were later generalized by Siegel(4,5,6,7) who
showed, among other things, that for every algebraic number in the above
inequality the exponent $\frac{n}{2}+1+\epsilon$ could be replaced by
$\frac{n}{m}+m-1+\epsilon$, where $m$ is some natural number.
  This note demonstrates a generalization of Thue's methods in (1); Like Thue I
restrict myself to the roots $\xi =\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}}$ of the binomial
equations. The continued fraction expansion of the binomial series is
generalized and algebraic approximation functions are given instead of rational
approximation functions. In doing so I proceed exactly as in my work on the
exponential function(8). Integrals are set up for the approximation functions;
thus the estimates become much easier and you can prove Thue's theorem with
Siegel's Exponents for the binomial algebraic equations without difficulty and
without use of the pigeonhole principle.

signal processing. In particular the analytic signal proposed by Gabor has as a
key component the Hilbert transform. The higher dimensional Hilbert transform
is the Riesz-Hilbert transform which was used by Felsberg and Sommer to
construct the monogenic signal. We will construct fractional and quaternionic
fractional Riesz-Hilbert transforms based on a eigenvalue decomposition. We
will prove properties of these transformations such as shift and scale
invariance, orthogonality and the semigroup property. Based on the
fractional/quaternionic fractional Riesz-Hilbert transform we construct
(quaternionic) fractional monogenic signals. These signals are rotated and
modulated monogenic signals.
