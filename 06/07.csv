  2015)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Color constancy is the recovery of true surface color from observed color,
and requires estimating the chromaticity of scene illumination to correct for
the bias it induces. In this paper, we show that the per-pixel color statistics
of natural scenes---without any spatial or semantic context---can by themselves
be a powerful cue for color constancy. Specifically, we describe an illuminant
estimation method that is built around a ""classifier"" for identifying the true
chromaticity of a pixel given its luminance (absolute brightness across color
channels). During inference, each pixel's observed color restricts its true
chromaticity to those values that can be explained by one of a candidate set of
illuminants, and applying the classifier over these values yields a
distribution over the corresponding illuminants. A global estimate for the
scene illuminant is computed through a simple aggregation of these
distributions across all pixels. We begin by simply defining the
luminance-to-chromaticity classifier by computing empirical histograms over
discretized chromaticity and luminance values from a training set of natural
images. These histograms reflect a preference for hues corresponding to smooth
reflectance functions, and for achromatic colors in brighter pixels. Despite
its simplicity, the resulting estimation algorithm outperforms current
state-of-the-art color constancy methods. Next, we propose a method to learn
the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier ""end-to-end"". Using stochastic
gradient descent, we set chromaticity-luminance likelihoods to minimize errors
in the final scene illuminant estimates on a training set. This leads to
further improvements in accuracy, most significantly in the tail of the error
distribution.

Currently, numerical integration schemes, mostly based on Gauss quadrature, are
widely used. Herein, we present an alternative semi-analytical approach for
mass matrix evaluation, resulting in an accurate, efficient and
easy-to-implement integration rule. To this end, integrands of mass matrix
entries get separated to two multiplicative parts. The first depends on natural
coordinates while the second depends also on element parameters (mesh). Second
part is approximated using polynomials and function evaluations at sampling
(integration) points, allowing later analytical integration to precompute the
weight matrices. Resulting formulas possess typical form such that
computational efficiency equivalence to traditional schemes is demonstrated,
namely our n-point formula is computationally equivalent to the conventional
use of n-point quadrature. Specifically, one and four-point semi-analytical
formulas are explicitly derived for an eight node brick element. Our one-point
rule describes exactly constant metric and density elements; four-point scheme
correctly admits the linear metric density multiplication. Dramatic superiority
in terms of accuracy is established based on coarse mesh study. Wherefore test
sets are generated with the help of ABAQUS, and then analyzed via variety of
formulas. Authors of the report intend to achieve the next goals: *
Introduction of an alternative way to compute the mass matrix of solid finite

tools for statistical inference. At the same time, it has become increasingly
common that a simulator (or generative model) is used to describe complex
processes that tie parameters $\theta$ of an underlying theory and measurement
apparatus to high-dimensional observations $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^p$.
However, simulator often do not provide a way to evaluate the likelihood
function for a given observation $\mathbf{x}$, which motivates a new class of
likelihood-free inference algorithms. In this paper, we show that likelihood
ratios are invariant under a specific class of dimensionality reduction maps
$\mathbb{R}^p \mapsto \mathbb{R}$. As a direct consequence, we show that
discriminative classifiers can be used to approximate the generalized
likelihood ratio statistic when only a generative model for the data is
available. This leads to a new machine learning-based approach to
likelihood-free inference that is complementary to Approximate Bayesian
Computation, and which does not require a prior on the model parameters.
Experimental results on artificial problems with known exact likelihoods
illustrate the potential of the proposed method.

observed polarisation images centred at 8.7, 10.3, and 12.5 $\mu$m into the
emissive and absorptive components from silicate grains that are aligned with
the local magnetic field. These components reveal the spatially-resolved
magnetic field structures across the mid-infrared emission area of K3-50. We
examine these structures and show that they are consistent with previously
observed features and physical models of K3-50, such as the molecular torus and
the ionised outflow. We propose a 3D geometry for all the structures seen at
different wavelengths. We also compute relevant physical quantities in order to
estimate the associated magnetic field strengths that would be implied under
various physical assumptions. We compare these results with MHD simulations of
protostar formation that predict the magnetic field strength and configuration.
We find that the magnetic field may be dynamically important in the innermost
0.2 pc of the molecular torus, but that the torus is more likely to be
rotationally-supported against gravity outside this radius. Similarly, magnetic
fields are unlikely to dominate the {\em global} physics of the ionised
outflow, but they may be important in helping confine the flow near the cavity
wall in some locations. Ours is the first application of the Aitken technique

information from complex model settings. Compared with the growing number of
frequentist methodologies, there are rather few theoretically optimal Bayes
methods that can deal with very general high dimensional models. In contrast,
Bayes methods have been extensively studied in various nonparametric settings
and rate optimal posterior contraction results have been established. This
paper provides a unified approach to both Bayes high dimensional statistics and
Bayes nonparametrics in a general framework of structured linear models. With
the proposed two-step model selection prior, we prove a general theorem of
posterior contraction under an abstract setting. The main theorem can be used
to derive new results on optimal posterior contraction under many complex model
settings including stochastic block model, graphon estimation and dictionary
learning. It can also be used to re-derive optimal posterior contraction for
problems such as sparse linear regression and nonparametric aggregation, which
improve upon previous Bayes results for these problems. The key of the success
lies in the proposed two-step prior distribution. The prior on the parameters
is an elliptical Laplace distribution that is capable to model signals with
large magnitude, and the prior on the models involves an important correction
factor that compensates the effect of the normalizing constant of the
elliptical Laplace distribution.

measurement $y_i=g_i(a_i^Tx_0)$, where the $a_i$'s are the rows of a known
measurement matrix $A$, and, $g$ is a (potentially unknown) nonlinear and
random link-function. Such measurement functions could arise in applications
where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could
also arise by design, e.g., $g_i(x)=\text{sign}(x+z_i)$, corresponds to noisy
1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger,
and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate $x_0$ via solving the
Generalized-LASSO for some regularization parameter $\lambda>0$ and some
(typically non-smooth) convex structure-inducing regularizer function. While
this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function $g$, both
Brillinger (in the non-constrained case) and Plan and Vershynin have shown
that, when the entries of $A$ are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator
of $x_0$ up to a constant of proportionality $\mu$, which only depends on $g$.
In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit
expressions for the squared error, for the \emph{regularized} LASSO, that are
asymptotically \emph{precise} when $m$ and $n$ grow large. A main result is
that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear
measurements is \emph{asymptotically the same} as one whose measurements are
linear $y_i=\mu a_i^Tx_0 + \sigma z_i$, with $\mu = E\gamma g(\gamma)$ and
$\sigma^2 = E(g(\gamma)-\mu\gamma)^2$, and, $\gamma$ standard normal. To the
best of our knowledge, the derived expressions on the estimation performance
are the first-known precise results in this context. One interesting
consequence of our result is that the optimal quantizer of the measurements
that minimizes the estimation error of the LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max
quantizer.

model based on an effective turbulent resistivity which is determined by the
turnover timescale of turbulent eddies and the magnetic energy density. The
magnetic resistivity increases compared to the Spitzer value and the effective
scale on which the magnetic energy spectrum is at its maximum moves to larger

of algorithms, including gradient descent, block coordinate descent, SAG, SAGA,
SDCA, SVRG, Finito/MISO, and their proximal variants. For all of these methods,
we provide acceleration and explicit support for non-strongly convex

is useful in practice, especially for ill-conditioned problems where we measure

to such problem as CVaR MDP. Our first contribution is to show that a CVaR
objective, besides capturing risk sensitivity, has an alternative
interpretation as expected cost under worst-case modeling errors, for a given
error budget. This result, which is of independent interest, motivates CVaR
MDPs as a unifying framework for risk-sensitive and robust decision making. Our
second contribution is to present an approximate value-iteration algorithm for
CVaR MDPs and analyze its convergence rate. To our knowledge, this is the first
solution algorithm for CVaR MDPs that enjoys error guarantees. Finally, we
present results from numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical

defined as probability distributions $\mu(S)\propto \exp(\beta f(S))$ over all
subsets $S\in 2^V$ of a finite set $V$ through a bounded set function
$f:2^V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and a parameter $\beta>0$. A subclass of discrete

log-submodular distributions, submodular point processes, and determinantal

shown to be effective for modeling diversity and coverage. We show that if the

mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that yield error bounds on marginal

consideration consists in minimizing a convex empirical risk function subject

mainly on Lagrangian penalty approximations, which often require ad hoc or
computationally expensive procedures to determine the penalization parameter.
We depart from this approach and address the constrained problem directly via a
splitting method. The structure of the method is that of the classical
gradient-projection algorithm, which alternates a gradient step on the
objective and a projection step onto the lower level set modeling the
constraint. The novelty of our approach is that the projection step is
implemented via an outer approximation scheme in which the constraint set is
approximated by a sequence of simple convex sets consisting of the intersection
of two half-spaces. Convergence of the iterates generated by the algorithm is
established for a general smooth convex minimization problem with inequality
constraints. Experiments on both synthetic and biological data show that our
method outperforms penalty methods.

techniques and group theoretical analysis, we studied rotational modes of the

rotational symmetry of the C-N axis (C4) along with three-fold rotation around
the C-N axis (C3), while in orthorhombic phase (T < 165K) only C3 rotation is
present. Around room temperature, the characteristic relaxation times for the
C4 rotation is found to be ps while for the C3 rotation ps. The -dependent
rotational relaxation times were fitted with Arrhenius equations to obtain
activation energies. Our data show a close correlation between the C4
rotational mode and the temperature dependent dielectric permittivity. Our

constraints extracted on $L$ from confronting them with observations. We focus
on six sets of observations and proposed explanations: (i) The cooling rate of
the neutron star in Cassiopeia A, confronting cooling models which include
enhanced cooling in the nuclear pasta regions of the inner crust, (ii) the
upper limit of the observed periods of young X-ray pulsars, confronting models
of magnetic field decay in the crust caused by the high resistivity of the
nuclear pasta layer, (iii) glitches from the Vela pulsar, confronting the
paradigm that they arise due to a sudden re-coupling of the crustal neutron
superfluid to the crustal lattice after a period during which they were
decoupled due to vortex pinning, (iv) The frequencies of quasi-periodic
oscillations in the X-ray tail of light curves from giant flares from soft
gamma-ray repeaters, confronting models of torsional crust oscillations, (v)
the upper limit on the frequency to which millisecond pulsars can be spun-up
due to accretion from a binary companion, confronting models of the r-mode
instability arising above a threshold frequency determined in part by the
viscous dissipation timescale at the crust-core boundary, and (vi) the
observations of precursor electromagnetic flares a few seconds before short
gamma-ray bursts, confronting a model of crust shattering caused by resonant
excitation of a crustal oscillation mode by the tidal gravitational field of a
companion neutron star just before merger.

of a complex cascade of hierarchical processing throughout visual cortex.
Previous studies have shown a correspondence between the similarity of
coarse-scale fMRI activation patterns and the perceived similarity of visual
stimuli, suggesting that visual objects that appear similar also share similar
underlying patterns of neural activation. Here we explore the temporal
relationship between the human brain's time-varying representation of visual
patterns and behavioral judgments of perceptual similarity. The visual stimuli
were abstract patterns constructed from identical perceptual units (oriented
Gabor patches) so that each pattern had a unique global form or perceptual
'Gestalt'. The visual stimuli were decodable from evoked neural activation
patterns measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG), however, stimuli differed
in the similarity of their neural representation as estimated by differences in
decodability. Early after stimulus onset (from 50ms), a model based on
retinotopic organization predicted the representational similarity of the
visual stimuli. Following the peak correlation between the retinotopic model
and neural data at 80ms, the neural representations quickly evolved so that
retinotopy no longer provided a sufficient account of the brain's time-varying
representation of the stimuli. Overall the strongest predictor of the brain's
representation was a model based on human judgments of perceptual similarity,
which reached the limits of the maximum correlation with the neural data
defined by the 'noise ceiling'. Our results show that large-scale brain
activation patterns contain a neural signature for the perceptual Gestalt of
composite visual features, and demonstrate a strong correspondence between
perception and complex patterns of brain activity.

from far few linear measurements than traditionally prescribed, thereby
efficiently decreasing sampling rates. However, if there exist nonlinearities
in the measurements, is it still possible to recover sparse or structured
signals from the nonlinear measurements? The research of nonlinear CS is
devoted to answering this question. In this paper, unlike the existing research
angles of nonlinear CS, we study it from the perspective of mapping
decomposition, and propose a new concept, namely, nonlinear CS based on
composite mappings. Through the analysis of two forms of a nonlinear composite
mapping Phi, i.e., Phi(x) = F(Ax) and Phi(x) = AF(x), we give the requirements
respectively for the sensing matrix A and the nonlinear mapping F when
reconstructing all sparse signals exactly from the nonlinear measurements
Phi(x). Besides, we also provide a special pointwise linearization method,
which can turn the nonlinear composite mapping Phi, at each point in its
domain, into an equivalent linear composite mapping. This linearization method
can guarantee the exact recovery of all given sparse signals even if Phi is not
an injection for all sparse signals. It may help us build an algorithm
framework for the composite nonlinear CS in which we can take full advantage of
the existing recovery algorithms belonging to linear CS.

value of $\kappa$ large, where $\kappa$ is the EiBI theory parameter. The
energy density of the Universe at the early stage is very high, and the
Universe is in a strong-gravity regime. Therefore, the perturbation feature is
not altered from what was investigated earlier. At the attractor inflationary
stage, however, the feature is changed in the strong EiBI-gravity limit. The
correction to the scalar perturbation in this limit comes mainly via the
background matter field, while that to the tensor perturbation comes directly
from the gravity ($\kappa$) effect. The change in the value of the scalar
spectrum is little compared with that in the weak EiBI-gravity limit, or in GR.
The form of the tensor spectrum is the same with that in the weak limit, but
the value of the spectrum can be suppressed down to zero in the strong limit.
Therefore, the resulting tensor-to-scalar ratio can also be suppressed in the
same way, which makes $\varphi^2$ model in EiBI theory viable.

correlation between successive channel inputs that is impossible by classical
means. It is known that the classical capacity of quantum channels can be
enhanced by such entangled encoding schemes, but this is not always the case.
In this paper, we prove that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical
capacity of an entanglement-breaking channel even when it is assisted by a
classical feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. In doing so, we
identify a bound on the strong converse exponent, which determines the
exponentially decaying rate at which the success probability tends to zero, for
a sequence of codes with communication rate exceeding capacity. Proving a
strong converse, along with an achievability theorem, shows that the classical
capacity is a sharp boundary between reliable and unreliable communication
regimes. One of the main tools in our proof is the sandwiched Renyi relative
entropy. The same method of proof is used to derive an exponential bound on the
success probability when communicating over an arbitrary quantum channel
assisted by classical feedback, provided that the transmitter does not use
entangled encoding schemes.

the exact functional of density functional theory. Its existence is proven, but
it is a complicated multivariable functional that is almost impossible to
conceptualize. In this paper, the asymmetric two-site Hubbard model is studied,
which has a two-dimensional universe of density matrices. The exact functional
becomes a simple function of two variables whose three dimensional energy
landscape can be visualized and explored. A walk on this unique landscape,
tilted to an angle defined by the one-electron Hamiltonian, gives a valley
whose minimum is the exact total energy. This is contrasted with the landscape
of some approximate functionals, explaining their failure for electron transfer
in the strongly correlated limit. We show concrete examples of pure-state
density matrices that are not $v$-representable due to the underlying
non-convex nature of the energy landscape. For the first time, the exact
functional is calculated for all numbers of electrons, including fractional,
allowing the derivative discontinuity to be visualized and understood. The
fundamental gap for all possible systems is obtained solely from the
derivatives of the exact functional.

short-range correlations in nuclei. To solve the many-body problem unitary
transformations like the similarity renormalization group (SRG) are often used
to soften the interactions.
  $\mathbf{Purpose:}$ Two-body densities can be used to illustrate how the SRG
eliminates short-range correlations in the wave function. The short-range
information can however be recovered by transforming the density operators.
  $\mathbf{Method:}$ The many-body problem is solved for $^4$He in the no core
shell model (NCSM) with SRG transformed AV8' and chiral N3LO interactions. The
NCSM wave functions are used to calculate two-body densities with bare and SRG
transformed density operators in two-body approximation.
  $\mathbf{Results:}$ The two-body momentum distributions for AV8' and N3LO
have similar high-momentum components up to relative momenta of about
$2.5\,\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$, dominated by tensor correlations, but differ in their
behavior at higher relative momenta. The contributions of many-body
correlations are small for pairs with vanishing pair momentum but not
negligible for the momentum distributions integrated over all pair momenta.
Many-body correlations are induced by the strong tensor force and lead to a
reshuffling of pairs between different spin-isospin channels.
  $\mathbf{Conclusions:}$ When using the SRG it is essential to use transformed
operators for observables sensitive to short-range physics. Back-to-back pairs
with vanishing pair momentum are the best tool to study short-range
correlations.

substantial uncertainties. Here we use a recent asymptotically exact theory for

varying the channel geometry, dye intercalation ratio, and ionic buffer

perpendicular or parallel to the condensate-plane. The tilting angle
constitutes an additional tuning parameter, which help us to control the
in-plane anisotropy of the soliton as well as provides access to previously
disregarded regimes of interaction parameters for soliton stability. In
addition, it can be used to drive the condensate into phonon instability
without changing its interaction parameters or trap geometry. The
phonon-instability in a homogeneous 2D condensate of tilted dipoles always
features a transient stripe pattern, which eventually breaks into a metastable
soliton gas. Finally, we demonstrate how a dipolar BEC in a shallow trap can
eventually be turned into a self-trapped matter wave by an adiabatic approach,

Most of existing
pre-training methods train simple models (e.g., restricted Boltzmann machines)
and then stack them layer by layer to form the deep structure. This layer-wise
pre-training has found strong theoretical foundation and broad empirical
support. However, it is not easy to employ such method to pre-train models
without a clear multi-layer structure,e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
This paper presents a new pre-training approach based on knowledge transfer
learning. In contrast to the layer-wise approach which trains model components
incrementally, the new approach trains the entire model as a whole but with an
easier objective function. This is achieved by utilizing soft targets produced
by a prior trained model (teacher model). Compared to the conventional
layer-wise methods, this new method does not care about the model structure, so
can be used to pre-train very complex models. Experiments on a speech
recognition task demonstrated that with this approach, complex RNNs can be well
trained with a weaker deep neural network (DNN) model. Furthermore, the new
method can be combined with conventional layer-wise pre-training to deliver
additional gains.

electric materials in condensed matter physics. When applied to cosmology, aka
cosmological hysteresis, has interesting and vivid implications in the scenario
of a cyclic bouncy universe. Most importantly, this physical prescription can
be treated as an alternative proposal to inflationary paradigm. Cosmological
hysteresis is caused by the asymmetry in the equation of state parameter during
expansion and contraction phase of the universe, due to the presence of a
single scalar field. This process is purely thermodynamical in nature, results
in a non-vanishing hysteresis loop integral $(\oint pdV)$ in cosmology. When
applied to variants of modified gravity models -1) Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
(DGP) brane world gravity, 2) Cosmological constant dominated Einstein gravity,
3) Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), 4) Einstien-Gauss-Bonnet brane world gravity and
5) Randall Sundrum single brane world gravity (RSII), under certain
circumstances, this phenomenon leads to the increase in amplitude of the
consecutive cycles and to a universe with older and larger successive cycles,
provided we have physical mechanisms to make the universe bounce and
turnaround. This inculcates an arrow of time in a dissipationless cosmology.
Remarkably, this phenomenon appears to be widespread in several cosmological
potentials in variants of modified gravity background, which we explicitly
study for- i) Hilltop, ii) Natural and iii) Colemann-Weinberg potentials, in
this paper. Semi-analytical analysis of these models, for different potentials
with minimum/minima, show that the conditions which creates a universe with an
ever increasing expansion, depend on the signature of the hysteresis loop
integral $(\oint pdV)$ as well as on the variants of model parameters.

difficulty lies in the extremely high dimensional voxel space and relatively

it will be even harder to obtain a reliable and consistent result.
Corresponding, we revisit our recently proposed algorithm based on stability
selection and structural sparsity. It is applied to the multi-center MRI data
analysis for the first time. A consistent and stable result is achieved across
different centers despite the between-center data variation while many other
state-of-the-art methods such as two sample t-test fail. Moreover, we have
empirically showed that the performance of this algorithm is robust and
insensitive to several of its key parameters. In addition, the support

  response","12 pages,1 figure",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a model based on branching process theory for the
proliferation and the dissemination network of T cells in the adaptive immune
response. A multi-type Galton Watson branching process is assumed as the basic
proliferation mechanism, associated to the migration of T cells of the
different generations from the draining lymph node to the spleen and other
lymphoid organs. Time recursion equations for the mean values and the
covariance matrices of the the cell population counts are derived in all the
compartments of the network model. Moreover, a normal approximation of the
log-likelihood function of the cell relative frequencies is derived, which
allows one to obtain estimates of both the probability parameters of the
branching process and the migration rates in the various compartments of the
network.

geographically-preferred topics, writing styles, and entities. These studies
rely on either GPS coordinates attached to individual messages, or on the
user-supplied location field in each profile. In this paper, we compare these
data acquisition techniques and quantify the biases that they introduce; we
also measure their effects on linguistic analysis and text-based geolocation.
GPS-tagging and self-reported locations yield measurably different corpora, and
these linguistic differences are partially attributable to differences in
dataset composition by age and gender. Using a latent variable model to induce
age and gender, we show how these demographic variables interact with geography
to affect language use. We also show that the accuracy of text-based
geolocation varies with population demographics, giving the best results for
men above the age of 40.

  identification and rain prediction using a Bayesian hierarchical model","37 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables; Corrected typos",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new statistical protocol for the estimation of precipitation
using lightning data. We first identify rainy events using a scan statistics,
then we estimate Rainfall Lighting Ratio (RLR) to convert lightning number into
rain volume given the storm intensity. Then we build a hierarchical Bayesian
model aiming at the prediction of 15- and 30-minutes cumulated precipitation at
unobserved locations and time using information on lightning in the same area.
More specifically, we build a Bayesian hierarchical model in which
precipitation is modeled as function of lightning count and space time
variation is handled using specific structured (random) effects. The mean
component of the model relates precipitation and lightning assuming that the
number of lightning recorded on a regular grid depends on the number of
lightning occurring in neighboring cells. We analyze several model formulations
where storms propagation speed, spatial dependence and time variation
incorporates different descriptions of the phenomena at hand. The space-time
variation is assumed separable. The study area is located in Central Italy,
where two storms, that differ for duration and intensity, are presented.

considered as renormalizably dressed since the conformal potential is nothing
but the top power-counting renormalizable self-interaction in the relevant
dimension. On the other hand, potentials defined by powers which are lower than
the conformal one are also phenomenologically relevant since they are in fact
super-renormalizable. In this work we provide a new map that allows to build
black holes dressed with all the (super-)renormalizable contributions starting
from known conformal seeds. We explicitly construct several new examples of
these solutions in dimensions $D=3$ and $D=4$, including not only stationary
configurations but also time-dependent ones.

Khachatourian and A.O. Wistrom were
released, in which the existence of an electrostatic torque has been claimed.
This moment of force should act in a three sphere configuration, where one
sphere is held at a constant electric potential. This claim was based on an
observed rotation and was supported by a mathematical solution derived by
Wistrom and Khachatourian. The theoretical work of Wistrom and Khachatourian as
well as the interpretation of the observed rotation were criticized by several
scientists who offered alternative explanations for the rotation. We therefore
designed an experimental setup which enabled us to investigate the phenomenon.
By performing numerous measurements, we showed that the rotation is due to
asymmetric mass distribution within the sphere, which is dislocated due to
electrostatic forces between the spheres. We were able to clear our
measurements from this effect and observed a null result more than two orders
of magnitude smaller than predicted by Khachatourian and Wistrom's theory. We
therefore showed that the rotation doesn't occur in an electrostatic system
within the resolution of our experiment.
