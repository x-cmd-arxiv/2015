requires more use of empirical data than has been done so far. It is clear that
an important role in driving this dynamics is played by social influence, which
is the essential ingredient of many quantitative models. Such models require
that all traits are fixed when specifying the ""initial cultural state"".
Typically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform
distribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent
work has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends
on the nature of the initial state. If the latter is sampled from empirical
data instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of
cultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of
propensity towards collective behavior in the short-term. Moreover, if the
initial state is randomized by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the
level of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the
empirical and uniformly random counterparts. The current study repeats the
analysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are
remarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural
variables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust
structural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, possibly due to
universal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world. The results
also suggest that this dynamics might be characterized by criticality and
involve mechanisms beyond social influence.

function $E_m(\hbar)$ with different semiclassical behaviors, $E_j^\pm(\hbar),$
along different paths. The corresponding $m$-nodes delocalized state
$\psi_m(\hbar)$ behaves along the same paths as the semiclassical $j$-nodes
states $\psi_j^\pm(\hbar),$ localized at one of the wells $x_\pm$ respectively.
In particular, if the crossing parameter $\hbar_n$ is by-passed from above, the
levels $E_{2n+(1/2)\pm(1/2)}(\hbar)$ have respectively the semiclassical
behaviors of the levels $E_n^\mp(\hbar)$ along the real axis. These results are
obtained by the control of the nodes. There is evidence that the parameters

equivalently, the success probability of transmissions over the typical link)
in Poisson bipolar and cellular networks with Rayleigh fading is relatively
straightforward, but it only provides limited information on the success
probabilities of the individual links. This paper introduces the notion of the
meta distribution of the SIR, which is the distribution of the conditional
success probability $P$ given the point process, and provides bounds, an exact
analytical expression, and a simple approximation for it. The meta distribution
provides fine-grained information on the SIR and answers questions such as
""What fraction of users in a Poisson cellular network achieve 90% link
reliability if the required SIR is 5 dB?"". Interestingly, in the bipolar model,
if the transmit probability $p$ is reduced while increasing the network density
$\lambda$ such that the density of concurrent transmitters $\lambda p$ stays
constant as $p\to 0$, $P$ degenerates to a constant, i.e., all links have
exactly the same success probability in the limit, which is the one of the
typical link. In contrast, in the cellular case, if the interfering base
stations are active independently with probability $p$, the variance of $P$
approaches a non-zero constant when $p$ is reduced to $0$ while keeping the

general but known to be solvable in $O(n^{4})$ time on $n$-vertex interval

Notably, Longest Path is trivially solvable in linear time on proper interval

(<z>=0.0057) galaxies using broadband photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and GALEX. For each galaxy, we compare the stellar mass derived by
summing the mass of each pixel to that found from fitting the entire galaxy
treated as an unresolved point source. We find that, while the pixel-by-pixel
and unresolved masses of galaxies with low specific star formation rates (such
as ellipticals and lenticulars) are in rough agreement, the unresolved mass
estimate for star-forming galaxies is systematically lower then the measurement
from spatially-resolved photometry. The discrepancy is strongly correlated with
sSFR, with the highest sSFRs in our sample having masses underestimated by 25%
(0.12 dex) when treated as point sources. We found a simple relation to
statistically correct mass estimates derived from unresolved broad-band SED
fitting to the resolved mass estimates: m_{resolved} =
m_{unresolved}/(-0.057log(sSFR) + 0.34) where sSFR is in units of yr^{-1}. We
study the effect of varying spatial resolution by degrading the image
resolution of the largest images and find a sharp decrease in the
pixel-by-pixel mass estimate at a physical scale of approximately 3 kpc, which
is comparable to spiral arm widths. The effects we observe are consistent with
the ""outshining"" idea which posits that the youngest stellar populations mask
more massive, older -- and thus fainter -- stellar populations. Although the
presence of strong dust lanes can also lead to a drastic difference between
resolved and unresolved mass estimates (up to 45% or 0.3 dex) for any
individual galaxy, we found that resolving dust does not affect mass estimates
on average. The strong correlation between mass discrepancy and sSFR is thus
most likely due to the outshining systematic bias.

from laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. In the first chapter,
six canonical models of convection are described: three configurations of IH
convection driven by constant and uniform volumetric heating, and three
configurations of RB convection driven by the boundary conditions. The IH
models are distinguished by differing pairs of thermal boundary conditions: top
and bottom boundaries of equal temperature, an insulating bottom with heat flux
fixed at the top, and an insulating bottom with temperature fixed at the top.
The RB models also are distinguished by whether temperatures or heat fluxes are
fixed at the top and bottom boundaries. Integral quantities important to heat
transport are discussed, including the mean fluid temperature, the mean
temperature difference between the boundaries, and the mean convective heat
transport. Integral relations and bounds are presented, and further bounds are
conjectured for the IH cases. The second chapter presents results that can be
derived mathematically from the governing equations: linear and nonlinear
stability thresholds of static states, and parameter-dependent bounds. Known
bounds are on mean temperatures in IH convection and on convective transport in
RB convection. The third chapter reviews numerical simulations and laboratory
experiments on IH convection, emphasizing quantitative results.

System. As a large population of small bodies, they record important
gravitational interactions and dynamical evolution of the Solar System. In the
past decade, significant advances have been made in understanding physical
properties, and there has been a revolution in thinking about the origin of
Trojans. The ice and organics generally presumed to be a significant part of
Trojan compositions have yet to be detected directly, though low density of the
binary system Patroclus (and possibly low density of the binary/moonlet system
Hektor) is consistent with an interior ice component. By contrast, fine-grained
silicates that appear to be similar to cometary silicates in composition have
been detected, and a color bimodality may indicate distinct compositional
groups among the Trojans. Whereas Trojans had traditionally been thought to
have formed near 5 AU, a new paradigm has developed in which the Trojans formed
in the proto-Kuiper Belt, and they were scattered inward and captured in the
Trojan swarms as a result of resonant interactions of the giant planets.
Whereas the orbital and population distributions of current Trojans are
consistent with this origin scenario, there are significant differences between
current physical properties of Trojans and those of Kuiper Belt objects. These
differences may be indicative of surface modification due to the inward
migration of objects that became the Trojans, but understanding of appropriate
modification mechanisms is poor and would benefit from additional laboratory
studies. Many open questions remain, and the future promises significant
strides in our understanding of Trojans. The time is ripe for a spacecraft
mission to the Trojans, to turn these objects into geologic worlds that can be
studied in detail to unravel their complex history.

cosmologies coupled to a scalaron $\psi$. For flat cosmologies ($k=0$), we
analyze in detail the gauge-independent equation describing the differential,
$\chi(\alpha)\equiv\psi^\prime(\alpha)$, of the map of the metric $\alpha$ to
the scalaron field $\psi$, which is the main mathematical characteristic
locally defining a `portrait' of a cosmology in `$\alpha$-version'. In the
`$\psi$-version', a similar equation for the differential of the inverse map,
$\bar{\chi}(\psi)\equiv \chi^{-1}(\alpha)$, can be solved asymptotically or for
some `integrable' scalaron potentials $v(\psi)$. In the flat case,
$\bar{\chi}(\psi)$ and $\chi(\alpha)$ satisfy the first-order differential
equations depending only on the logarithmic derivative of the potential. Once
we know a general analytic solution for one of these $\chi$-functions, we can
explicitly derive all characteristics of the cosmological model. In the
$\alpha$-version, the whole dynamical system is integrable for $k\neq 0$ and
with any `$\alpha$-potential', $\bar{v}(\alpha)\equiv v[\psi(\alpha)]$,
replacing $v(\psi)$. There is no a priori relation between the two potentials
before deriving $\chi$ or $\bar{\chi}$, which implicitly depend on the
potential itself, but relations between the two pictures can be found by
asymptotic expansions or by inflationary perturbation theory. Explicit
applications of the results to a more rigorous treatment of the chaotic
inflation models and to their comparison with the ekpyrotic-bouncing ones are
outlined in the frame of our `$\alpha$-formulation' of isotropic scalaron
cosmologies. In particular, we establish an inflationary perturbation expansion
for $\chi$. When all the conditions for inflation are satisfied and $\chi$
obeys a certain boundary (initial) condition, we get the standard inflationary
parameters, with higher-order corrections.

is the result of the formation of a system of multiple embryos with
approximately the mass of Mars in the inner disk and of a few multi-Earth-mass
cores in the outer disk, within the lifetime of the gaseous component of the
protoplanetary disk. What was the origin of this dichotomy in the mass
distribution of embryos/cores? We show in this paper that the classic processes
of runaway and oligarchic growth from a disk of planetesimals cannot explain
this dichotomy, even if the original surface density of solids increased at the
snowline. Instead, the accretion of drifting pebbles by embryos and cores can
explain the dichotomy, provided that some assumptions hold true. We propose
that the mass-flow of pebbles is two-times lower and the characteristic size of
the pebbles is approximately ten times smaller within the snowline than beyond
the snowline (respectively at heliocentric distance $r<r_{ice}$ and
$r>r_{ice}$, where $r_{ice}$ is the snowline heliocentric distance), due to ice
sublimation and the splitting of icy pebbles into a collection of
chondrule-size silicate grains. In this case, objects of original sub-lunar
mass would grow at drastically different rates in the two regions of the disk.
Within the snowline these bodies would reach approximately the mass of Mars
while beyond the snowline they would grow to $\sim 20$ Earth masses. The
results may change quantitatively with changes to the assumed parameters, but
the establishment of a clear dichotomy in the mass distribution of protoplanets
appears robust, provided that there is enough turbulence in the disk to prevent
the sedimentation of the silicate grains into a very thin layer.

the observed hybrid nature, related to binarity or to surface inhomogeneities.
The finding that most delta Scuti stars also show long-period light variations
represents a real challenge for theory.
  Methods: Fourier analysis of all the available Kepler light curves.
Investigation of the frequency and period spacings. Determination of the
stellar physical parameters from spectroscopic observations. Modelling of the
transit events.
  Results: The Fourier analysis of the Kepler light curves revealed 55
significant frequencies clustered into two groups, which are separated by a gap
between 15 and 27 c/d. The light variations are dominated by the beating of two
dominant frequencies located at around 4 c/d. The amplitudes of these two
frequencies show a monotonic long-term trend. The frequency spacing analysis
revealed two possibilities: the pulsator is either a highly inclined moderate
rotator (v~70 km/s, i > 70 deg) or a fast rotator (v~200 km/s) with i~20 deg.
The transit analysis disclosed that the transit events which occur with a ~197
c/d period may be caused by a 1.6 R_Jup body orbiting a fainter star, which
would be spatially coincident with KIC 9533489.

interpreted through model results. All pieces come together to show that Hund's
coupling, besides being responsible for the electronic correlations even in
absence of a strong Coulomb repulsion is also the origin of a subtle emergent
behavior: orbital decoupling. Indeed Hund's exchange decouples the charge
excitations in the different Iron orbitals involved in the conduction bands
thus causing an independent tuning of the degree of electronic correlation in
each one of them. The latter becomes sensitive almost only to the offset of the
orbital population from half-filling, where a Mott insulating state is
invariably realized at these interaction strengths. Depending on the difference
in orbital population a different 'Mottness' affects each orbital, and thus
reflects in the conduction bands and in the Fermi surfaces depending on the

and initial masses up to $M_{\rm ini}=350\,M_\odot$. The main difference with
respect to our previous models of massive stars is the adoption of a recent
formalism accounting for the mass-loss enhancement when the ratio of the
stellar to the Eddington luminosity, $\Gamma_e$, approaches unity. With this
new formalism, the models are able to reproduce the Humphreys-Davidson limit
observed in the Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud colour-magnitude diagrams,
without an ad hoc mass-loss enhancement. We also follow the predictions of
recent wind models indicating that the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss
rates becomes shallower when $\Gamma_e$ approaches unity. We thus find that the
more massive stars may suffer from substantial mass-loss even at low
metallicity. We also predict that the Humphreys-Davidson limit should become
brighter at decreasing metallicity. We supplement the evolutionary tracks with
new tables of theoretical bolometric corrections, useful to compare tracks and
isochrones with the observations. For this purpose, we homogenize existing
stellar atmosphere libraries of hot and cool stars (PoWR, ATLAS9 and Phoenix)

critiques concerning model complexity it is increasingly important to develop
predictive mechanistic frameworks that capture the dominant features of
ecological communities and their dependencies on environmental factors. This is
particularly important for critical global processes such as biomass changes,
carbon export, and biogenic climate feedback. Past efforts have successfully
understood a broad spectrum of plant and community traits across a range of
biological diversity and body size, including tree size distributions and
maximum tree height, from mechanical, hydrodynamic, and resource constraints.
Recently it was shown that global scaling relationships for net primary
productivity are correlated with local meteorology and the overall biomass
density within a forest. Along with previous efforts, this highlights the
connection between widely observed allometric relationships and predictive
ecology. An emerging goal of ecological theory is to gain maximum predictive
power with the least number of parameters. Here we show that the explicit
dependence of such critical quantities can be systematically predicted knowing
just the size of the largest tree. This is supported by data showing that
forests converge to our predictions as they mature. Since maximum tree size can
be calculated from local meteorology this provides a general framework for
predicting the generic structure of forests from local environmental parameters
thereby addressing a range of critical Earth-system questions.

the semileptonic decay modes, the interference is affected by tree-level
background contributions enhanced by 1/e^2 relative to the gluon-fusion
continuum background in the fully leptonic decay modes. We find that for both
light and heavy Higgs masses the interference with the loop-induced weak-boson
pair background dominates over the interference with the tree-level weak-boson
plus jets background for a range of selection cuts. We therefore conclude that
higher-order background contributions can induce leading interference effects.

water, it rapidly attains its steady-state swimming speed since changes in the
velocity field spread quickly when the Reynolds number is small. However,
swimming microorganisms are commonly found or studied in complex fluids.
Because these fluids have long relaxation times, the time to attain the steady-
state swimming speed can also be long. In this article we study the swimming
startup problem in the simplest liquid crystalline fluid: a two-dimensional
hexatic liquid crystal film. We study the dependence of startup time on
anchoring strength and Ericksen number, which is the ratio of viscous to
elastic stresses. For strong anchoring, the fluid flow starts up immediately
but the liquid crystal field and swimming velocity attain their sinusoidal
steady-state values after a time proportional to the relaxation time of the
liquid crystal. When the Ericksen number is high, the behavior is the same as
in the strong anchoring case for any anchoring strength. We also find that the
startup time increases with the ratio of the rotational viscosity to the shear
viscosity, and then ultimately saturates once the rotational viscosity is much
greater than the shear viscosity.

that this leads to calculable dispersion-space distortions in the apparent

thousand over the whole sky per day and, if cosmological, the sources of these

the great majority are (likely longtime) cluster members. They are a passively

considered are based on state-of-the-art numerical relativistic simulations of
the bubble collision spacetime, evolved using the full temperature and
polarization transfer functions. Comparing a theoretical
cosmic-variance-limited experiment to the WMAP and Planck satellites, we find
that there is no improvement to be gained from future temperature data, that
adding polarization improves detectability by approximately 30%, and that
cosmic-variance-limited polarization data offer only marginal improvements over
Planck. The fundamental parameter constraints achievable depend on the precise
values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio and energy density in (negative) spatial
curvature. For a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $0.1$ and spatial curvature at the
level of $10^{-4}$, using cosmic-variance-limited data it is possible to
measure the width of the potential barrier separating the inflating false

distance between colliding bubbles to a factor $\pi/2$ of the false vacuum

scale in a two Higgs doublet model, in which the two Higgs doublets jointly act
as the flavon. Quark masses and mixing angles are explained by effective Yukawa
couplings, generated by higher dimensional operators involving quarks and Higgs
doublets. Modified Higgs couplings yield important effects on the production
cross sections and decay rates of the light Standard Model like Higgs. In
addition, flavor changing neutral currents arise at tree-level and lead to
strong constraints from meson-antimeson mixing. Remarkably, flavor constraints
turn out to prefer a region in parameter space that is in excellent agreement
with the one preferred by recent Higgs precision measurements at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). Direct searches for extra scalars at the LHC lead to
further constraints. Precise predictions for the production and decay modes of
the additional Higgs bosons are derived, and we present benchmark scenarios for
searches at the LHC Run II. Flavor breaking at the electroweak scale as well as
strong coupling effects demand a UV completion at the scale of a few TeV,
possibly within the reach of the LHC.

bulk material properties has been overturned by recent work on nanoscale
waveguides. It is now understood that boundary forces of radiation pressure and
electrostriction appearing in such highly confined waveguides can make a
significant contribution to the Brillouin gain. Here, this concept is extended
to show that gain enhancement does not require nanoscale or subwavelength
features, but generally appears where optical and acoustic fields are
simultaneously confined near a free surface or material interface. This
situation routinely occurs in whispering gallery resonators (WGRs), making gain
enhancements much more accessible than previously thought. To illustrate this
concept, the first full-vectorial analytic model for SBS in WGRs is developed,
including optical boundary forces, and the SBS gain in common silica WGR
geometries is computationally evaluated. These results predict that gains
$10^4$ times greater than the predictions of scalar theory may appear in WGRs
even in the 100 um size range. Further, trapezoidal cross-section microdisks
can exhibit very large SBS gains approaching $10^2$ m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$. With
resonant amplification included, extreme gains on the order of $10^{12}$
m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$ may be realized, which is $10^8$ times greater than the
highest predicted gains in linear waveguide systems.

the quantitative results of NT and its extensions for physicists who are

paradigm, galactic halos are predicted to contain a large population of dark
matter subhalos. While the most massive members of the subhalo population can
appear as luminous satellites and be detected in optical surveys, establishing
the existence of the low mass and mostly dark subhalos has proven to be a
daunting task. Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses have been successfully
used to study mass substructures lying close to lensed images of bright
background sources. However, in typical galaxy-scale lenses, the strong lensing
region only covers a small projected area of the lens's dark matter halo,
implying that the vast majority of subhalos cannot be directly detected in
lensing observations. In this paper, we point out that this large population of
dark satellites can collectively affect gravitational lensing observables,
hence possibly allowing their statistical detection. Focusing on the region of
the galactic halo outside the strong lensing area, we compute from first
principles the statistical properties of perturbations to the gravitational
time delay and position of lensed images in the presence of a mass substructure
population. We find that in the standard cosmological scenario, the statistics
of these lensing observables are well approximated by Gaussian distributions.
The formalism developed as part of this calculation is very general and can be
applied to any halo geometry and choice of subhalo mass function. Our results
significantly reduce the computational cost of including a large substructure
population in lens models and enable the use of Bayesian inference techniques
to detect and characterize the distributed satellite population of distant lens
galaxies.

`twisted'-right action. The asymptotic distributions of bi-matrix models of
Gaussian random variables tend to bi-free central limit distributions with
certain covariance matrices. Furthermore, many classical random matrix results
immediately generalize to the bi-free setting. For example, bi-matrix models of
left and right creation and annihilation operators on a Fock space have joint
distributions equal to left and right creation and annihilation operators on a
Fock space and are bi-freely independent from the left and right action of

The spectra do not evolve between 50 mK and 2 K, indicating that the spin
dynamics is only little affected by the temperature in both the short-range
correlated and ordered regimes. Although classical spin dynamics simulations
qualitatively capture some of the experimental observations, we show that they
fail to reproduce this broad continuum. In particular, the simulations predict
an energy scale twice smaller than the experimental observations. This analysis
is based on a careful determination of the exchange couplings, able to
reproduce both the zero field diffuse scattering and the spin wave spectrum
rising in the field polarized state. According to this analysis, \ybti\ lies at
the border between a ferro and an antiferromagnetic phase. These results
suggest that the unconventional ground state of \ybti\ is governed by strong
quantum fluctuations arising from the competition between those phases. The

CTL escape variants in a given host population. Here, we ask: are rates of
escape and reversion comparable across infected host populations? For three
cohorts taken from three continents, we estimate escape and reversion rates at
23 escape sites in optimally defined Gag epitopes. We find consistent escape
rate estimates across the examined cohorts. Reversion rates are also consistent
between a Canadian and South African infected host population. Certain Gag
escape variants that incur a large replicative fitness cost are known to revert
rapidly upon transmission. However, the relationship between escape/reversion
rates and viral replicative capacity across a large number of epitopes has not
been interrogated. We investigate this relationship by examining $in$ $vitro$
replicative capacities of viral sequences with minimal variation: point escape
mutants induced in a lab strain. Remarkably, despite the complexities of
epistatic effects exemplified by pathways to escape in famous epitopes, and the
diversity of both hosts and viruses, CTL escape mutants which escape rapidly
tend to be those with the highest replicative capacity when applied as a single
point mutation. Similarly, mutants inducing the greatest costs to viral
replicative capacity tend to revert more quickly. These data suggest that
escape rates in Gag are consistent across host populations, and that in general
these rates are dominated by site specific effects upon viral replicative
capacity.

contagion of growth rate in a trade credit network of firms. Our hypotheses are
that the use of trade credit contributes to contagion (from many customers to a
single supplier - ""many to one"" contagion) and amplification (through their
interaction with the macrocopic variables, such as interest rate) of growth
rate. In this paper we test the contagion hypothesis, measuring empirically the
mesoscopic ""many-to-one"" effect. The effect of amplification has been dealt
with in another paper.
  Our empirical analysis is based on the delayed payments between trading
partners across many different industrial sectors, intermediated by a large
Italian bank during the year 2007. The data is used to create a weighted and
directed trade credit network. Assuming that the linkages are static, we look
at the dynamics of the nodes/firms. On the ratio of the 2007 trade credit in
Sales and Purchases items on the profit and loss statements, we estimate the
trade credit in 2006 and 2008.
  Applying the ""many to one"" approach we compare such predicted growth of trade
(demand) aggregated per supplier, and compare it with the real growth of Sales
of the supplier. We analyze the correlation of these two growth rates over two
yearly periods, 2007/2006 and 2008/2007, and in this way we test our contagion
hypotheses. We could not find strong correlations between the predicted and the
actual growth rates. We provide an evidence of contagion only in restricted
sub-groups of our network, and not in the whole network. We do find a strong
macroscopic effect of the crisis, indicated by a coincident negative drift in
the growth of sales of nearly all the firms in our sample.

Yu","Predicting Neighbor Distribution in Heterogeneous Information Networks",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, considerable attention has been devoted to the prediction problems
arising from heterogeneous information networks. In this paper, we present a
new prediction task, Neighbor Distribution Prediction (NDP), which aims at
predicting the distribution of the labels on neighbors of a given node and is
valuable for many different applications in heterogeneous information networks.
The challenges of NDP mainly come from three aspects: the infinity of the state
space of a neighbor distribution, the sparsity of available data, and how to
fairly evaluate the predictions. To address these challenges, we first propose
an Evolution Factor Model (EFM) for NDP, which utilizes two new structures
proposed in this paper, i.e. Neighbor Distribution Vector (NDV) to represent
the state of a given node's neighbors, and Neighbor Label Evolution Matrix
(NLEM) to capture the dynamics of a neighbor distribution, respectively. We
further propose a learning algorithm for Evolution Factor Model. To overcome
the problem of data sparsity, the learning algorithm first clusters all the
nodes and learns an NLEM for each cluster instead of for each node. For fairly
evaluating the predicting results, we propose a new metric: Virtual Accuracy
(VA), which takes into consideration both the absolute accuracy and the
predictability of a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three real
datasets from different domains validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model EFM and metric VA.

the sample position are important ingredients to analyze the $\mu$SR spectra.
We present here the measured energy losses in the thin carbon foil of the muon
start detector deduced from time-of-flight measurements. Muonium formation in
the thin carbon foil (10 nm thickness) of the muon start detector also affect
the measurable decay asymmetry and therefore need to be accounted for. Muonium
formation and energy losses in the start detector, whose relevance increase
with decreasing muon implantation energy ($<10$ keV), have been implemented in
Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation to reproduce the measured time-of-flight spectra.
Simulated and measured time-of-flight and beam spot agrees only if a small
fraction of so called ""unmoderated"" muons which contaminate the mono-energetic
muon beam of the $\mu$SR spectrometer is introduced. Moreover the sensitivity
of the beam size and related upstream-downstream asymmetry for a specially
shaped ""nose"" sample plate has been studied for various beam line settings,
which is of relevance for the study of thermal muonium emission into vacuum
from mesoporous silica at cryogenic temperatures.

  Kidnapped Robot",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Planning under uncertainty is a key requirement for physical systems due to
the noisy nature of actuators and sensors. Using a belief space approach,
planning solutions tend to generate actions that result in information seeking
behavior which reduce state uncertainty. While recent work has dealt with
planning for Gaussian beliefs, for many cases, a multi-modal belief is a more
accurate representation of the underlying belief. This is particularly true in
environments with information symmetry that cause uncertain data associations
which naturally lead to a multi-modal hypothesis on the state. Thus, a planner
cannot simply base actions on the most-likely state. We propose an algorithm
that uses a Receding Horizon Planning approach to plan actions that
sequentially disambiguate the multi-modal belief to a uni-modal Gaussian and
achieve tight localization on the true state, called a Multi-Modal Motion
Planner (M3P). By combining a Gaussian sampling-based belief space planner with
M3P, and introducing a switching behavior in the planner and belief
representation, we present a holistic end-to-end solution for the belief space
planning problem. Simulation results for a 2D ground robot navigation problem
are presented that demonstrate our method's performance.

strongly relies on the assumption that the important variables in the model

formation are changes of the physical and thermo-optical properties of such

coarse-graining procedure starting from the atomistic level, an anisotropic
effective (Gay-Berne-like) potential capable of describing van-der-Waals
contributions to the interaction energy. To take into account electrostatics,
we introduce, first, a linear quadrupole moment along the symmetry axis of the
coronene disc. The second approach takes into account the fact that the partial
charges within the molecules are distributed in a ring-like fashion. We then
reparametrize the effective Gay-Berne-like potential such that it matches, at
short distances, the ring-ring potential. To investigate the validity of these
two approaches, we perform many-particle Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations,
focusing on the crystalline phase (karpatite) where electrostatic interaction
effects are expected to be particularly relevant for the formation of tilted
stacked columns. Specifically, we investigate various structural parameters as
well as the melting transition. We find that the second approach yields
consistent results with those from experiments despite the fact that the
underlying potential decays with the wrong distance dependence at large

  Diameter","Submitted to FOCS 15 on April 2nd",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The radius and diameter are fundamental graph parameters. They are defined as
the minimum and maximum of the eccentricities in a graph, respectively, where
the eccentricity of a vertex is the largest distance from the vertex to another
node. In directed graphs, there are several versions of these problems. For
instance, one may choose to define the eccentricity of a node in terms of the
largest distance into the node, out of the node, the sum of the two directions
(i.e. roundtrip) and so on. All versions of diameter and radius can be solved
via solving all-pairs shortest paths (APSP), followed by a fast postprocessing
step. Solving APSP, however, on $n$-node graphs requires $\Omega(n^2)$ time
even in sparse graphs, as one needs to output $n^2$ distances.
  Motivated by known and new negative results on the impossibility of computing
these measures exactly in general graphs in truly subquadratic time, under
plausible assumptions, we search for \emph{approximation} and \emph{fixed
parameter subquadratic} algorithms, and for reasons why they do not exist.
  Our results include: - Truly subquadratic approximation algorithms for most
of the versions of Diameter and Radius with \emph{optimal} approximation
guarantees (given truly subquadratic time), under plausible assumptions. In
particular, there is a $2$-approximation algorithm for directed Radius with
one-way distances that runs in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time, while a
$(2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm in $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time is unlikely. -
On graphs with treewidth $k$, we can solve the problems in
$2^{O(k\log{k})}n^{1+o(1)}$ time. We show that these algorithms are near
optimal since even a $(3/2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm that runs in time
$2^{o(k)}n^{2-\epsilon}$ would refute the plausible assumptions.

galaxies, galaxies in a cluster are expected to point preferentially towards
the center of the cluster, as a result of the cluster's tidal force on its
member galaxies. In this work an analytic model is formulated to simulate this
effect. The deformation time scale of a galaxy in a cluster is usually much
shorter than the time scale of change of the tidal force; the dynamical process
of the tidal interaction within the galaxy can thus be ignored. An equilibrium
shape of a galaxy is then assumed to be the surface of equipotential, which is
the sum of the self-gravitational potential of the galaxy and the tidal
potential of the cluster at this location. We use a Monte-Carlo method to
calculate the radial orientation distribution of these galaxies, by assuming
the NFW mass profile of the cluster and the initial ellipticity of field
galaxies. The radial angles show a single peak distribution centered at zero.
The Monte-Carlo simulations also show that a shift of the reference center from
the real cluster center weakens the anisotropy of the radial angle
distribution. Therefore, the expected radial alignment cannot be revealed if
the distribution of spatial position angle is used instead of that of radial
angle. The observed radial orientations of elliptical galaxies in cluster
Abell~2744 are consistent with the simulated distribution.

strong forces, we present a quantum field theory of gravity based on spin and
scaling gauge symmetries. A biframe spacetime is initiated to describe such a
quantum gravity theory. The gravifield sided on both locally flat noncoordinate
spacetime and globally flat Minkowski spacetime is an essential ingredient for
gauging global spin and scaling symmetries. The locally flat gravifield
spacetime spanned by the gravifield is associated with a noncommutative
geometry characterized by a gauge-type field strength of the gravifield. A
coordinate-independent and gauge-invariant action for the quantum gravity is
built in the gravifield basis. In the coordinate basis, we derive equations of
motion for all quantum fields including the gravitational effect and obtain
basic conservation laws for all symmetries. The equation of motion for
gravifield tensor is deduced in connection directly with the total
energy-momentum tensor. When the spin and scaling gauge symmetries are broken
down to a background structure that possesses the global Lorentz and scaling
symmetries, we obtain exact solutions by solving equations of motion for the
background fields in a unitary basis. The massless graviton and massive spinon
result as physical quantum degrees of freedom. The resulting Lorentz-invariant
and conformally flat background gravifield space-time is characterized by a
cosmic vector with a nonzero cosmological mass scale. The conformal size of the
Universe becomes singular at the cosmological horizon and turns out to be
inflationary. A mechanism for quantum inflation is demonstrated to generate the
inflation of the early Universe. Two types of gravity equation result, one is
as the extension to Einstein's equation of general relativity, and the other is
a new one that characterizes spinon dynamics.

running behavior in animals and humans as well as has been used as a design
basis for robots capable of dynamic locomotion. Anchoring the SLIP for lossy
physical systems resulted in newer models which are extended versions of
original SLIP with viscous damping in the leg. However, such lossy models
require an additional mechanism for pumping energy to the system to control the
locomotion and to reach a limit-cycle. Some studies solved this problem by
adding an actively controllable torque actuation at the hip joint and this
actuation has been successively used in many robotic platforms, such as the
popular RHex robot. However, hip torque actuation produces forces on the COM
dominantly at forward direction with respect to ground, making height control
challenging especially at slow speeds. The situation becomes more severe when
the horizontal speed of the robot reaches zero, i.e. steady hoping without
moving in horizontal direction, and the system reaches to singularity in which
vertical degrees of freedom is completely lost. To this end, we propose an
extension of the lossy SLIP model with a slider-crank mechanism, SLIP- SCM,
that can generate a stable limit-cycle when the body is constrained to vertical
direction. We propose an approximate analytical solution to the nonlinear
system dynamics of SLIP- SCM model to characterize its behavior during the
locomotion. Finally, we perform a fixed-point stability analysis on SLIP-SCM
model using our approximate analytical solution and show that proposed model
exhibits stable behavior in our range of interest.

that these observations are quantitatively described by parameter free ab

be a rich field for the study of geometrical frustration in 3 dimensions.
Recently, a new family of magnetic oxides has been synthesised in which the
half of the tetrahedra in the pyrochlore lattice are inflated relative to the
other half, making an alternating array of small and large tetrahedra. These
""breathing pyrochlore"" materials such as LiGaCr4O8, LiInCr4O8 and Ba3Yb2Zn5O11
provide new opportunities in the study of frustrated magnetism. Here we provide
an analytic theory for the ground state phase diagram and spin correlations for
the minimal model of magnetism in breathing pyrochlores: a classical nearest
neighbour Heisenberg model with different exchange coefficients for the two
species of tetrahedra. We find that the phase diagram comprises a Coulombic
spin liquid phase, a conventional ferromagnetic phase and an unusual
antiferromagnetic phase with lines of soft modes in reciprocal space,
stabilised by an order-by-disorder mechanism. We obtain a theory of the spin
correlations in this model using the Self Consistent Gaussian Approximation
(SCGA) which enables us to discuss the development of correlations in breathing
pyrochlores as a function of temperature, and we quantitatively characterise
the thermal crossover from the limit of isolated tetrahedra to the strongly
correlated limit of the problem. We compare the results of our analysis with
the results of recent neutron scattering experiments on LiInCr4O8.

correlated random processes are used in many areas and often require the
solution of a large linear system based on the covariance matrix of the

applied have steadily increased such that straightforward statistical tools are
computationally too expensive to be used. In the univariate context, tapering,
i.e., creating sparse approximate linear systems, has been shown to be an
efficient tool in both the estimation and prediction settings. The asymptotic
properties are derived under an infill asymptotic setting. In this paper we use
a domain increasing framework for estimation and prediction using multivariate
tapering. Under this asymptotic regime we prove that tapering (one-tapered
form) preserves the consistency of the untapered maximum likelihood estimator
and show that tapering has asymptotically the same mean squared prediction
error as using the corresponding untapered predictor. The theoretical results

empirical measure of excursion sets in the non-nodal case. Concerning the nodal

We prove almost sure convergence, asymptotic normality giving the bias

Markov chains. Finally, we address the question of asymmetry and develop an
asymptotic test for the equality of the two autoregressive functions.

properties of driven colloidal suspensions. In the present article we suggest a
feedback scheme to enhance the collective transport of colloidal particles with
repulsive interactions through a one-dimensional tilted washboard potential.
The control is modelled by a harmonic confining potential, mimicking an optical
""trap"", with the center of this trap moving with the (instantaneous) mean
particle position. Our theoretical analysis is based on the Smoluchowski
equation combined with Dynamical Density Functional Theory (DDFT) for systems
with hard-core or ultra-soft (Gaussian) interactions. For either type of
interaction we find that the feedback control can lead to an enhancement of the
mobility by several orders of magnitude relative to the uncontrolled case. The
largest effects occur for intermediate stiffness of the trap and large particle
numbers. Moreover, in some regions of the parameter space the feedback control
induces oscillations of the mean velocity. Finally, we show that the
enhancement of mobility is robust against a small time delay in implementing
the feedback control.

distributions of the vertical [B_v] and the horizontal [B_h] component of the

correlated; in contrast, the rise of a flux-tube loop would result in a
qualitatively different pattern, with the maxima of the two magnetic-field

either spot emerges, while the maximum horizontal-field strengths would be
reached in between them. A specific feature, which we call the bordering
effect, is revealed: some local extrema of B_v are bordered with areas of
locally enhanced B_h. This effect suggests a fountainlike spatial structure of
the magnetic field near the B_v extrema, which is also hardly compatible with
the emergence of a flux-tube loop. The vertical-velocity field in the area of
the developing active subregion does not exhibit any upflow on the scale of the

contacts enforces constraints on position and velocity level at the same time.
It yields a robust numerical discretization of differential algebraic equations
avoiding the drift-off effect. In this work, we carry over these benefits to
impacting mechanical systems with unilateral constraints. For this kind of a
mechanical system, adding the position level constraint to a timestepping
scheme on velocity level even maintains physical consistency of the impulsive
discretization. Hence, we propose a timestepping scheme based on Moreau's
midpoint rule which enables to achieve not only compliance of the impact law
but also of the non-penetration constraint. The choice of a decoupled and
consecutive evaluation of the respective constraints can be interpreted as a
not energy-consistent projection to the non-penetration constraint at the end
of each time step. It is the implicit coupling of position and velocity level
which yields satisfactory results. An implicit evaluation of the right hand
side improves stability properties without additional cost. With the prox
function formulation, the overall set of nonsmooth equations is solved by a
Newton scheme. Results from simulations of a slider-crank mechanism with
unilateral constraints demonstrate the capability of our approach.

SOFIA, and in CO(3-2), (4-3), (6-5), 13CO(3-2), and [CI]3P1-3P0 and 3P2-3P1
with APEX. The emission of all transitions observed shows a large variation in
the line profiles across the map and between the different species. At most
positions the [CII] emission line profile is substantially wider than that of
CO and [CI]. We estimated the fraction of the [CII] integrated line emission
that cannot be fitted by the CO line profile to be 20%-50%. We derived the
relative contribution from C+, C, and CO to the column density in each velocity
bin. The contribution from C+ dominates the velocity range far from the
velocities traced by the dense molecular gas, and the region located between
the CO cores of N159 W and E. We estimate the contribution of the ionized gas
to the [CII] emission using the ratio to the [NII] emission to be < 19% to the
[CII] emission at its peak position, and <15% over the whole observed region.
Using the integrated line intensities, we present the spatial distribution of
I([CII])/I(FIR). (abridged for arXiv)

Computational prediction of protein complexes faces several challenges
including the lack of sufficient protein interactions, presence of noise in
protein interaction datasets and difficulty in predicting small and sparse
complexes. These challenges are covered in most reviews of complex prediction
methods. However, an important challenge that needs to be addressed is the
prediction of membrane complexes. These are often ignored because existing
protein interaction detection techniques do not detect interactions between
membrane proteins. But, recently there have been several new experimental
techniques including MY2H that are capable of detecting membrane protein
interactions. In the light of this new data, we discuss here new challenges and
the kind of open problems that need to be solved to effectively detect membrane
complexes.

almost all channel matrices. We also provide a construction of corresponding

dicto, or de re. Following \cite{Marcos:2005}, we adopt its de dicto

true; otherwise, it is accidental. In this article, we study the model theory
and axiomatization of the logic of essence and accident, i.e. the logic with
essence operator (or accident operator) as the only primitive modality. We show
that the logic of essence and accident is less expressive than modal logic on
non-reflexive models, but the two logics are equally expressive on reflexive
models. We prove that some frame properties are undefinable in the logic of
essence and accident, while some are. We propose the suitable bisimulation for
this logic, based on which we characterize the expressive power of this logic
within modal logic and within first-order logic. We axiomatize this logic over
various frame classes, among which the symmetric case is missing, and our
method is more suitable than those in the literature. We also find a method to
compute certain axioms used to axiomatize this logic over special frames in the
literature. As a side effect, we answer some open questions raised in

interactions in interface-resolved simulations of particle-laden flows. Three
types of inter-particle interactions are taken into account: (1) long- and (2)
short-range hydrodynamic interactions, and (3) solid-solid contact. Long-range
interactions are incorporated through an efficient and second-order accurate
immersed boundary method (IBM). Short-range interactions are also partly
reproduced by the IBM. However, since the IBM uses a fixed-grid, a lubrication
model is needed for an inter-particle gap width smaller than the grid spacing.
The lubrication model is based on asymptotic expansions of analytical solutions
for canonical lubrication interactions between spheres in the Stokes regime.
Roughness effects are incorporated by making the lubrication correction
independent of the gap width for gap widths smaller than $\sim 1\%$ of the
particle radius. This correction is applied until the particles reach
solid-solid contact. To model solid-solid contact we use a variant of a linear
soft-sphere collision model capable of stretching the collision time. This
choice is computationally attractive because it allows to reduce the number of
time steps required for integrating the collision force accurately and is
physically realistic, provided that the prescribed collision time is much
smaller than the characteristic timescale of particle motion. We verified the
numerical implementation of our collision model and validated it against
several benchmark cases for immersed head-on particle-wall and
particle-particle collisions, and oblique particle-wall collisions. The results
show good agreement with experimental data.

  Method: For a given dynamic analysis technique, our test suite refactoring
approach monitors the execution of test cases and identifies small test cases
without loss of the test ability. We apply B-Refactoring to assist two existing
analysis tasks: automatic repair of if-statements bugs and automatic analysis
of exception contracts.
  Results: Experimental results show that test suite refactoring can
effectively simplify the execution traces of the test suite. Three real-world
bugs that could previously not be fixed with the original test suite are fixed
after applying B-Refactoring; meanwhile, exception contracts are better
verified via applying B-Refactoring to original test suites.
  Conclusions: We conclude that applying B-Refactoring can effectively improve
the purity of test cases. Existing dynamic analysis tasks can be enhanced by
test suite refactoring.

triple systems through their eclipse timing variations (ETVs). Eclipses by the
third body in those systems, if observed, provide precise constraints on its
physical and orbital properties, which are otherwise difficult to obtain. In
this Letter, we analyze such a ""tertiary event"" observed only once in the KIC
6543674 system. The system consists of a short-period ($2.4\,\mathrm{days}$)
inner eclipsing binary and a third body on a wide ($1100\,\mathrm{days}$) and
eccentric ($e\simeq0.6$) orbit. Analysis of three tertiary eclipses around a
single inferior conjunction of the third body yields the mutual inclination
between the inner and outer binary planes to be $3.3^\circ\pm0.6^\circ$,
indicating an extremely flat geometry. Furthermore, combining the timings and
shapes of the tertiary eclipses with the phase curve and ETVs of the inner
binary, we determine the mass and radius ratios of all three bodies in the
system using the Kepler photometry alone. With the primary mass and temperature
from the Kepler Input Catalog, the absolute masses, radii, and effective
temperatures of the three stars are obtained as follows:
$M_\mathrm{A}=1.2\pm0.3\,M_\odot$, $R_\mathrm{A}=1.8\pm0.1\,R_\odot$,
$M_\mathrm{B}=1.1_{-0.2}^{+0.3}\,M_\odot$, $R_\mathrm{B}=1.4\pm0.1\,R_\odot$,

Green's functions using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the
hybridization expansion (CT-HYB). Instead of measuring Green's functions by
removing hybridization lines from partition function configurations, as in
conventional CT-HYB, the worm algorithm directly samples the Green's function.
We show that worm sampling is necessary to obtain general two-particle Green's
functions which are not of density-density type and that it improves the
sampling efficiency when approaching the atomic limit. Such two-particle
Green's functions are needed to compute off-diagonal elements of
susceptibilities and occur in diagrammatic extensions of the dynamical mean
field theory and efficient estimators for the single-particle self-energy.

morphologically-Rich Language (MRL) such as Arabic, due to the complexities and
challenges exist in the nature of the languages itself. One of these challenges
is the detection of idioms or proverbs phrases within the writer text or

peculiar to itself. Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual
meanings of its elements and can yield different sentiment when treats as
separate words. Consequently, In order to facilitate the task of detection and
classification of lexical phrases for automated SA systems, this paper presents
AIPSeLEX a novel idioms/ proverbs sentiment lexicon for modern standard Arabic
(MSA) and colloquial. AIPSeLEX is manually collected and annotated at sentence
level with semantic orientation (positive or negative). The efforts of manually
building and annotating the lexicon are reported. Moreover, we build a
classifier that extracts idioms and proverbs, phrases from text using n-gram
and similarity measure methods. Finally, several experiments were carried out
on various data, including Arabic tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel
reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments) from publicly available
Arabic online reviews websites (social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce web
sites) to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of AIPSeLEX.

on his current battery power, time and day along with incentives offered by

willing users in the neighborhood of source user (SU), before selecting users
as cooperative nodes. Only inactive users belonging to Virtual Antenna Array

cooperative node discovery. In this paper, we employ prediction algorithm using
two machine learning techniques i.e. ANN and SVM to find out inactive willing

recall are calculated to evaluate performance of ANN and SVM model. Prediction
using ANN has MSE of 3% with average accuracy of 97% (variance 0.37), whereas

studied thoroughly since decades in order to shed light on the behavior of the
central regions of galaxies in general and of active galaxies in particular.
The Galactic Center has shown a wealth of structures on different scales with a
complicated mixture of early- and late-type stars, ionized and molecular gas,
dust and winds. Here we aim at studying the distribution of water ices and
hydrocarbons in the central parsec as well as along the line of sight. This
study is made possible thanks to L-band spectroscopy. This spectral band, from
2.8 to 4.2$\mu m$, hosts important signatures of the circumstellar medium and
interstellar dense and diffuse media among which deep absorption features are
attributed to water ices and hydrocarbons. We observed the Galactic Center in
the L-band of ISAAC spectrograph located on UT1/VLT ESO telescope. By mapping
the central half parsec using 27 slit positions, we were able to build the
first data cube of the region in this wavelength domain. Thanks to a calibrator
spectrum of the foreground extinction in the L-band derived in a previous
paper, we corrected our data cube for the line of sight extinction and
validated our calibrator spectrum. The data show that a residual absorption due
to water ices and hydrocarbons is present in the corrected data cube. This
suggests that the features are produced in the local environment of the
Galactic center implying very low temperatures well below 80K. This is in
agreement with our finding of local CO ices in the central parsec described in
Moultaka et al. (2015).

Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) that estimate the joint probability of a DNA

sequence.
  Here we construct conditional PWMs that depend on the motif signatures in the
flanking DNA sequence, by conditioning known binding site loci on the presence

the estimation of the conditional distribution function over the binding site

patterning the Dorsal-Ventral axis of Drosophila development. We find that
those binding sites that cooperate with nearby Twist sites on average contain
about 0.5 bits of information about the presence of Twist transcription factor
binding sites in the flanking sequence. We also find that Dorsal binding site
detectors conditioned on flanking sequence information make better predictions

the second-neighbor hopping has a strong impact on the band structure, leading
to the emergence of a new extremum located inside the band, accompanied by a
van Hove singularity in the density of states. The energy band is then divided
into a subcritical regime with the usual unique correspondence between wave
number and energy of the travelling waves, and a supercritical regime, in which
waves of different wave number are degenerate in energy. We study the
consequences of these features in a scattering setup, introducing a defect that
locally breaks the translational invariance. The notion of a local probability
current is generalized beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation and bound
states with energies outside the band are discussed. At subcritical energies
inside the band, an evanescent mode coexists with the travelling plane wave,
giving rise to resonance phenomena in scattering. At weak coupling to the
defect, we identify a prototypical Fano-Feshbach resonance of tunable shape and
provide analytical expressions for its profile parameters. At supercritical
energies, we observe coupling of the degenerate travelling waves, leading to an
intricate wave packet fragmentation dynamics. The corresponding branching

coding (NC) can be used to reliably disseminate large files under intermittent
connectivity. Conventional NC involves random unrestricted coding at
intermediate nodes. This however is vulnerable to pollution attacks. To avoid
attacks, a brute force approach is to restrict the mixing at the source.
However, source restricted NC generally reduces the robustness of the code in
the face of errors, losses and mobility induced intermittence. CB-MANETs
introduce a new option. Caching is common in CB MANETs and a fully reassembled
cached file can be viewed as a new source. Thus, NC packets can be mixed at all
sources (including the originator and the intermediate caches) yet still
providing protection from pollution. The hypothesis we wish to test in this
paper is whether in CB-MANETs with sufficient caches of a file, the performance
(in terms of robustness) of the restricted coding equals that of unrestricted
coding.
  In this paper, we examine and compare unrestricted coding to full cache
coding, source only coding, and no coding. As expected, we find that full cache
coding remains competitive with unrestricted coding while maintaining full

program is to extract and then solve a recurrence that expresses evaluation
cost in terms of input size. The relevant notion of input size is often
specific to a datatype, with measures including the length of a list, the
maximum element in a list, and the height of a tree. In this work, we give a
formal account of the extraction of cost and size recurrences from higher-order
functional programs over inductive datatypes. Our approach allows a wide range
of programmer-specified notions of size, and ensures that the extracted
recurrences correctly predict evaluation cost. To extract a recurrence from a
program, we first make costs explicit by applying a monadic translation from
the source language to a complexity language, and then abstract datatype values
as sizes. Size abstraction can be done semantically, working in models of the
complexity language, or syntactically, by adding rules to a preorder judgement.
We give several different models of the complexity language, which support
different notions of size. Additionally, we prove by a logical relations
argument that recurrences extracted by this process are upper bounds for
evaluation cost; the proof is entirely syntactic and therefore applies to all
of the models we consider.

automorphisms $f_+$ and $f_-$ of $\mathcal{A}$ respectively; on the other hand,
excepting type $D_{2n},(n\geqslant 2)$, all the cluster automorphisms of
$\mathcal{A}$ are compositions of $f_+$ and $f_-$. For a cluster algebra of
type $D_{2n},(n\geqslant 2)$, there exists exceptional cluster automorphism
induced by a permutation of negative simple roots in $\Phi_{\geq -1}$, which is
not a composition of $\tau_+$ and $\tau_-$. By using these results and folding
a simply laced cluster algebra, we compute the cluster automorphism group for a
non-simply laced finite type cluster algebra. As an application, we show that
$Aut(\mathcal{A})$ is isomorphic to the cluster automorphism group of the
$FZ$-universal cluster algebra of $\mathcal{A}$.

undergraduate or graduate students in theoretical physics to understand, in a
familiar context, some concepts relevant to the study of classical and quantum
field theories. We use a geometric approach to derive the Hamiltonian
formulation for the model considered in the paper: four equal masses connected
by six ideal rods. We obtain and discuss the meaning of several important
elements, in particular, the constraints and the Hamiltonian vector fields that
define the dynamics of the system, the constraint manifold, gauge symmetries,
gauge orbits, gauge fixing, and the reduced phase space.

entropy, and thus any modification of the area law leads to a modified
holographic energy density. Inspired by the entropy expression associated with
the apparent horizon of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe in DGP
braneworld, we propose a new model for the holographic dark energy in the
framework of DGP brane cosmology. We investigate the cosmological consequences
of this new model and calculate the equation of state parameter by choosing the
Hubble radius, $L = H^{-1}$, as the system's IR cutoff. Our study show that,
due to the effects of the extra dimension (bulk), the identification of
IR-cutoff with Hubble radius, can reproduce the present acceleration of the
Universe expansion. This is in contrast to the ordinary holographic dark energy
in standard cosmology which leads to the zero equation of state parameter in
the case of choosing the Hubble radius as system's IR cutoff in the absence of
interaction between dark matter and dark energy.

by the multiquadrics themselves is considered. Additionally, $L_p$ error
estimates in terms of the dilation $h$ are considered for the associated
cardinal interpolation scheme. This analysis expands the range of $\alpha$
values which were previously known to give such convergence rates (i.e.
$O(h^k)$ for functions with derivatives of order up to $k$ in $L_p$,
$1<p<\infty$). Additionally, the analysis here demonstrates that some known
best approximation rates for multiquadric approximation are obtained by their
cardinal interpolants.

sharing pairwise: one carbon atom (spiro-[n]adamantane or
