accretion disks around tilted Kerr BH. We investigate the evolution of three
different initial disk models with a range of initial black hole spin
magnitudes and tilt angles. For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios
considered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and
nutation during the evolution. This indicates that for such mass ratios,
neglecting the self-gravity of the disks by evolving them in a fixed background
black hole spacetime is not justified. We find that the two more massive models
are unstable against the Papaloizou-Pringle (PP) instability and that those
PP-unstable models remain unstable for all initial spins and tilt angles
considered, showing that the development of the instability is a very robust
feature of such PP-unstable disks. Our lightest model, which is the most
astrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is
stable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated
during the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment
of black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with
constant specific angular momentum l. For the model with non-constant l-profile
we observe a long-lived m=1 non-axisymmetric structure which shows strong
oscillations of the tilt angle in the inner regions of the disk. This effect
might be connected to the development of Kozai-Lidov oscillations. Our
simulations also confirm earlier findings that the development of the PP
instability causes the long-term emission of large amplitude gravitational
waves, predominantly for the l=m=2 multipole mode. The imprint of the BH
precession on the gravitational waves from tilted BH-torus systems remains an
interesting open issue that would require significantly longer simulations than
those presented in this work.

turns out that the main theoretical uncertainties, associated with the
effective axial coupling g_A and with the nucleon-nucleon potential, can be
parametrized in terms of NME rescaling factors, up to small residuals. From
this parametrization, the following QRPA features emerge: (1) the NME
dependence on g_A is milder than quadratic; (2) in each of the two mechanisms,
the relevant lepton number violating parameter is largely degenerate with the
NME rescaling factors; and (3) the light and heavy neutrino exchange mechanisms
are basically degenerate in the above three nuclei. We comment on the
challenging theoretical and experimental improvements required to reduce such

been examined in detail. The results are compared with our earlier ones from
before a quarter of a century (Grabowski et al. 1987, hereafter ApJ'87; Madej
and Grabowski 1990). In these earlier papers, as a dominant constituent of the
Balmer-line-profiles, the standard, symmetrical Stark line profiles, shifted as
the whole by PS-effect, were applied to all spectrally active layers of the WD
atmosphere. At present, in each of the WD layers, the Stark-line-profiles
(especially of $H_\beta$) are immanently asymmetrical and shifted due to the
effects of strong inhomogeneity of the perturbing fields in plasma. To
calculate the Stark line-profiles in successive layers of the WD atmosphere we
used the modified Full Computer Simulation Method (mFCSM), able to take
adequately into account the complexity of local elementary quantum processes in
plasma. In the case of the $H_\alpha$ line, the present value of Stark-induced
shift of the synthetic $H_\alpha$ line-profile is about twice smaller than the
previous one (ApJ'87) and it is negligible in comparison with the gravitational
red shift. In the case of the $H_\beta$ line, the present value of
Stark-induced shift of the synthetic $H_\beta$ line-profile is about twice
larger than the previous one. The source of this extra shift is the asymmetry
of $H_\beta$ peaks.

of the quasistatic potential energy surfaces (QSPES) often used to analyse
strong-field processes. We show that the gauge-independent component of the
TDPES has a mean-field-like character very close to the density-weighted
average of the QSPESs. Oscillations in this component are smoothened out by the
gauge-dependent component, and both components are needed to yield the correct
force on the nuclei. Once the localization begins to set in, the gradient of
the exact TDPES tracks one QSPES and then switches to the other, similar to the
description provided by surface-hopping between QSPESs. We show that evolving
an ensemble of classical nuclear trajectories on the exact TDPES accurately
reproduces the exact dynamics. This study suggests that the mixed

smooth enough to admit locally inertial coordinates at points of shock wave
interaction, or whether ""regularity singularities"" can exist at such points.
The term {\it regularity singularity} was proposed by the authors as a point in
spacetime where the gravitational metric tensor is Lipschitz continuous
($C^{0,1}$), but no smoother, in any coordinate system of the $C^{1,1}$ atlas.
An existence theory for shock wave solutions in $C^{0,1}$ admitting arbitrary
interactions has been proven for the Einstein-Euler equations in spherically
symmetric spacetimes, but $C^{1,1}$ is the requisite smoothness required for
space-time to be locally flat. Thus the open problem of regularity
singularities is the problem as to whether locally inertial coordinate systems
exist at shock waves within the larger $C^{1,1}$ atlas. To clarify this open
problem, we identify new ""Coriolis type"" effects in the geometry of $C^{0,1}$
shock wave metrics and prove they are essential in the sense that they can
never be made to vanish within the atlas of {\it smooth} coordinate
transformations, the atlas usually assumed in classical differential geometry.
Thus the problem of existence of regularity singularities is equivalent to the
question as to whether or not these Coriolis type effects are essentially
non-removable and `real', or merely coordinate effects that can be removed, (in
analogy to classical Coriolis forces), by going to the less regular atlas of
$C^{1,1}$ transformations. If essentially non-removable, it would argue
strongly for a `real' new physical effect for General Relativity, providing a
physical context to the open problem of regularity singularities.

extensive attentions due to its non-volatility, high density and low power

junction (MTJ), which possesses a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio as well
as a large value of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). It has been
experimentally proven that a capping layer coating on CoFeB layer is essential
to obtain a strong PMA. However, the physical mechanism of such effect remains
unclear. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the PMA in
MgO/CoFe/metallic capping layer structures by using a first-principles
computation scheme. The trend of PMA variation with different capping materials
agrees well with experimental results. We find that interfacial PMA in the
three-layer structures comes from both the MgO/CoFe and CoFe/capping layer
interfaces, which can be analyzed separately. Furthermore, the PMAs in the
CoFe/capping layer interfaces are analyzed through resolving the magnetic
anisotropy energy by layer and orbital. The variation of PMA with different
capping materials is attributed to the different hybridizations of both d and p
orbitals via spin-orbital coupling. This work can significantly benefit the
research and development of nanoscale STT-MRAM.

the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
find two velocity components in Lyman $\alpha$ at $\sim1830$ and 1900 km/s in

of $\geq23$ kpc for that cloud. Using various combinations of constraints,
including photo-ionization modeling for one absorber, lower limits on masses of

long-slit spectroscopy of MCG -01-04-005 obtained at the Apache Point

rather typical, non-starbursting late-type galaxy so that these size and mass
results should be generic for this class. Therefore, at least some CGM clouds

charge carrier tunability for thinner devices, we find that electron transport
is dominated by bulk contributions for all devices. Phase coherence lengths
$\l_\phi$ as extracted from WAL measurements increase linearly with increasing
electron density exceeding $1 \mu $m at 1.7 K. While $\l_\phi$ is in
qualitative agreement with electron electron interaction-induced dephasing, we
find that spin flip scattering processes limit $\l_\phi$ at low temperatures.

always-increasing use of cloud-computing and memory delegation, which require

format-specific properties are preserved, while all message-specific properties
remain hidden, thus guaranteeing data privacy. As experimental results show

extend our scheme to support large formats, by imposing a user-defined bound on
the maximal format size, thus obtaining a flexible security-efficiency tradeoff

half a century. In this pedagogical article we review the work of these Nobel
recipients and discuss its implications. We approach the topic from the
perspective of a dynamically generated Higgs boson that is a
fermion-antifermion bound state rather than an elementary field that appears in
an input Lagrangian. In particular, we emphasize the connection with the BCS
theory of superconductivity. We identify the double-well Higgs potential not as
a fundamental potential but as a mean-field effective Lagrangian with a
dynamical Higgs boson being generated through a residual interaction that
accompanies the mean-field Lagrangian. We discuss what we believe to be the key
challenge raised by the discovery of the Higgs boson, namely determining
whether it is elementary or composite, and suggest that the width of the Higgs
boson might serve as a suitable diagnostic for discriminating between an
elementary Higgs boson and a composite one.

Our sum rules eliminate the penguin topologies $P$ and $PA$, which cannot be
determined from branching ratios. In this way we can make predictions about
direct CP asymmetries in the standard model without ad hoc assumptions on the
sizes of penguin diagrams. We consistently include first-order SU(3)$_F$

confronting our sum rules with future precise data from LHCb and Belle~II one
will identify or constrain new-physics contributions to $P$ or $PA$. The first
sum rule correlates the CP asymmetries $a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}}$ in $D^0\to
K^+K^-$, $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$, and $D^0\to \pi^0\pi^0$. We study the region of
the $a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}}(D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-)$--$a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}} (D^0\to

more than half of the allowed region at 95\% C.L. Our second sum rule
correlates the direct CP asymmetries in $D^+\rightarrow \bar{K}^0 K^+$,
$D_s^+\rightarrow K^0 \pi^+$, and $D_s^+\rightarrow K^+\pi^0$.

construct detached from its underlying science, the physics of macroscopic
bodies. In particular, the regularities that delineate the scope of validity of
Newtonian mechanics was never used as premises in that construct. Instead, its
logical structure has been built with the only purpose to ease the presentation
of mechanics as an application of calculus and algebra. This leaves no room for
the explicit physical description of the fundamental notions of the construct,
such as the ability of (a system of) physical bodies to keep a spatial form,
symbolized by a rigid measuring rod, and the possibility to count out even
temporal intervals, symbolized by a standard clock, let alone the origin of the
basic mechanical quantities.
  The comparison between (states of) physical objects is possible as far as the
natural regularities enable a researcher to define an equivalence relation in a
set of these objects. The class of macroscopic (or macroscopically perceived)
objects is that one where certain composition rules hold so that constituents
of any object are macroscopic, too. Then the properties of compositions of
macroscopic objects, being in conjunction with the equivalence relations
between them, yield a numerical characterization of each macroscopic object,
i.e. a basic physical quantity. The technique of logically arranged
feasible/thought experiments is used to formulate the logically impeccable,
induction-based definitions for two quantities: the length of a line segment as
an instructive toy example and the mass of a macroscopic body as an example
applicable to the real world.

is often used to perform approximate Bayesian parameter learning. EP
approximates the full intractable posterior distribution through a set of local
approximations that are iteratively refined for each datapoint. EP can offer
analytic and computational advantages over other approximations, such as
Variational Inference (VI), and is the method of choice for a number of models.
The local nature of EP appears to make it an ideal candidate for performing
Bayesian learning on large models in large-scale dataset settings. However, EP
has a crucial limitation in this context: the number of approximating factors
needs to increase with the number of data-points, N, which often entails a
prohibitively large memory overhead. This paper presents an extension to EP,
called stochastic expectation propagation (SEP), that maintains a global
posterior approximation (like VI) but updates it in a local way (like EP).
Experiments on a number of canonical learning problems using synthetic and
real-world datasets indicate that SEP performs almost as well as full EP, but
reduces the memory consumption by a factor of $N$. SEP is therefore ideally
suited to performing approximate Bayesian learning in the large model, large
dataset setting.

galaxies in the field at redshifts 0.1 $<$ z $<$ 0.375. Kinematics ($\sigma_g$,
V$_{rot}$) are measured from emission lines in Keck/DEIMOS spectra and
quantitative morphology is measured from V- and I-band Hubble images. We find a
transition stellar mass in the TFR, $\log$ M$_*$ = 9.5 M$_{\odot}$. Above this
mass, nearly all galaxies are rotation-dominated, on average more
morphologically disk-like according to quantitative morphology, and lie on a
relatively tight TFR. Below this mass, the TFR has significant scatter to low
rotation velocity and galaxies can either be rotation-dominated disks on the
TFR or asymmetric or compact galaxies which scatter off. We refer to this
transition mass as the ""mass of disk formation"", M$_{\mathrm{df}}$ because
above it all star-forming galaxies form disks (except for a small number of
major mergers and highly star-forming systems), whereas below it a galaxy may

SOI, whereby the electron spin is locked to its momentum at a right-angle,

electric-field-induced superconductivity in molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), which

out-of-plane Zeeman-type spin polarization of energy valleys. We find an upper
critical field of approximately 52 T at 1.5 K, which indicates an enhancement
of the Pauli limit by a factor of four as compared to that in centrosymmetric
conventional superconductors. Using realistic tight-binding calculations, we
reveal that this unusual behaviour is due to an inter-valley pairing that is
symmetrically protected by Zeeman-type spin-valley locking against external

unclear how to interpret the low incidence of the MW and M31 planes in

that planar structures are very common, and that ~10% of $\Lambda$CDM haloes

ubiquitous, the planes of satellite galaxies show a large diversity in their
properties. This precludes using one or two systems as small scale probes of

misinterpreted as a discrepancy between the satellite planes observed in the
Local Group and $\Lambda$CDM predictions. In fact, ~10% of $\Lambda$CDM

non-gaussianity parameter f_NL but the interesting regime f_NL <~ 1 is beyond
their reach. Brightness-temperature fluctuations in the 21-cm line during the
dark ages (z ~ 30-100) are a promising successor to CMB studies, giving access
to a much larger number of modes. They are, however, intrinsically non-linear,
which results in secondary non-gaussianities orders of magnitude larger than
the sought-after primordial signal. In this paper we carefully compute the
primary and secondary bispectra of 21-cm fluctuations on small scales. We use
the flat-sky formalism, which greatly simplifies the analysis, while still
being very accurate on small angular scales. We show that the secondary
bispectrum is highly degenerate with the primordial one, and argue that even
percent-level uncertainties in the amplitude of the former lead to a bias of
order Delta f_NL ~ 10. To tackle this problem we carry out a detailed Fisher
analysis, marginalizing over the amplitudes of a few smooth redshift-dependent
coefficients characterizing the secondary bispectrum. We find that the
signal-to-noise ratio for a single redshift slice is reduced by a factor of ~5
in comparison to a case without secondary non-gaussianities. Setting aside
foreground contamination, we forecast that a cosmic-variance-limited experiment
observing 21-cm fluctuations over 30 < z < 100 with a 0.1-MHz bandwidth and
0.1-arcminute angular resolution could achieve a sensitivity of order
f_NL[local] ~ 0.03, f_NL[equilateral] ~ 0.04, and f_NL[orthogonal] ~ 0.03.

is a faint dwarf spheroidal (dSph) in the M81 group of galaxies. It contains
five old GCs, which makes it the galaxy with the highest known specific
frequency (SN=126). We estimate the photometric age, metallicity and spatial
distribution of the poorly studied IKN GCs. We search SDSS for GC candidates
beyond the HST field of view, which covers half of IKN. To break the
age-metallicity degeneracy in the V-I colour we use WHT/LIRIS Ks-band
photometry and derive photometric ages and metallicities by comparison with SSP
models in the V,I,Ks colour space. IKN GCs' VIKs colours are consistent with
old ages ($\geq\!8$ Gyr) and a metallicity distribution with a higher mean than
typical for such a dSph ([Fe/H$]\!\simeq\!-1.4_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ dex). Their
photometric masses range ($0.5 <{\cal M_{\rm GC}}<4\times10^5M_\odot$) implies
a high mass ratio between GCs and field stars, of $10.6\%$. Mixture model
analysis of the RGB field stars' metallicity suggests that 72\% of the stars
may have formed together with the GCs. Using the most massive GC-SFR relation
we calculate a SFR of $\sim\!10M_\odot/$yr during its formation epoch. We note
that the more massive GCs are closer to the galaxy photometric centre. IKN GCs
also appear spatially aligned along a line close to the IKN major-axis and
nearly orthogonal to the plane of spatial distribution of galaxies in the M81
group. We identify one new IKN GC candidate based on colour and PSF analysis of
the SDSS data. The evidence towards i) broad and high metallicity distribution
of the field IKN RGB stars and its GCs, ii) high fraction and iii), spatial
alignment of IKN GCs, supports a scenario for tidally triggered complex IKN's
SFH in the context of interactions with galaxies in the M81 group.

function of galaxy morphology in 22 galaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey
(THINGS). We stack individual HI velocity profiles and decompose them into
broad and narrow Gaussian components. We study the HI velocity dispersion and
the HI surface density, as a function of radius. For spirals, the velocity
dispersions of the narrow and broad components decline with radius and their
radial profiles are well described by an exponential function. For dwarfs,
however, the profiles are much flatter. The single Gaussian dispersion profiles
are, in general, flatter than those of the narrow and broad components. In most
cases, the dispersion profiles in the outer disks do not drop as fast as the
star formation profiles, derived in the literature. This indicates the
importance of other energy sources in driving HI velocity dispersion in the
outer disks. The radial surface density profiles of spirals and dwarfs are
similar. The surface density profiles of the narrow component decline more
steeply than those of the broad component, but not as steep as what was found
previously for the molecular component. As a consequence, the surface density
ratio between the narrow and broad components, an estimate of the mass ratio
between cold HI and warm HI, tends to decrease with radius. On average, this
ratio is lower in dwarfs than in spirals. This lack of a narrow, cold HI
component in dwarfs may explain their low star formation activity.

properties of galaxies in the nearby universe, based on 300 galaxies from the

stellar mass. We apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellar
mass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, and
mass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our target
galaxies. To study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individual
radial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. We confirm that
more massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and less
reddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved
spatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these
relations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact,
older, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching is
related to morphology, but not driven by mass. Negative gradients of ages are
consistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest ages
gradients in Sb-Sbc galaxies. Further, the mean stellar ages of disks and
bulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late type
spirals hosting younger disks. The gradients in stellar mass surface density
depend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are more
centrally concentrated. There is a secondary correlation in the sense that at
the same mass early type galaxies have steeper gradients. We find mildly
negative metallicity gradients, shallower than predicted from models of galaxy
evolution in isolation. The largest gradients occur in Sb galaxies. Overall we
conclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass,
while metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependent
processes.

image of methanol emission is compared to recent ALMA observations toward a
high-mass cluster and the similarity is striking: the toy model reproduces
observations to better than a factor of two and suggests that approximately
50\% of the total flux originates in low-mass outflows. Future fine-tuning of
the model will eventually make it a tool for interpreting the embedded low-mass
population of distant regions within our own Galaxy and ultimately
higher-redshift starburst galaxies, not just for methanol emission but also
water and high-J CO.

birth and death processes and we give non-explosion and extinction criteria,
moment computations and a pathwise representation. We then show how different
scales may lead to different qualitative approximations, either ODEs or SDEs.
The prototypes of these equations are the logistic (deterministic) equation and
the logistic Feller diffusion process. The convergence in law of the sequence
of processes is proved by tightness-uniqueness argument. In these large
population approximations, the competition between individuals leads to
nonlinear drift terms. We then focus on models without interaction but
including exceptional events due either to demographic stochasticity or to
environmental stochasticity. In the first case, an individual may have a large
number of offspring and we introduce the class of continuous state branching
processes. In the second case, catastrophes may occur and kill a random
fraction of the population and the process enjoys a quenched branching
property. We emphasize on the study of the Laplace transform, which allows us
to classify the long time behavior of these processes. In the second chapter,
we model structured populations by measure-valued stochastic differential
equations. Our approach is based on the individual dynamics. The individuals
are characterized by parameters which have an influence on their survival or
reproduction ability. Some of these parameters can be genetic and are
inheritable except when mutations occur, but they can also be a space location
or a quantity of parasites. The individuals compete for resources or other
environmental constraints. We describe the population by a point measure-valued
Markov process. We study macroscopic approximations of this process depending
on the interplay between different scalings and obtain in the limit either
integro-differential equations or reaction-diffusion equations or nonlinear
super-processes. In each case, we insist on the specific techniques for the
proof of convergence and for the study of the limiting model. The limiting
processes offer different models of mutation-selection dynamics. Then, we study
two-level models motivated by cell division dynamics, where the cell population
is discrete and characterized by a trait, which may be continuous. In 1
particular, we finely study a process for parasite infection and the trait is
the parasite load. The latter grows following a Feller diffusion and is
randomly shared in the two daughter cells when the cell divides. Finally, we
focus on the neutral case when the rate of division of cells is constant but
the trait evolves following a general Markov process and may split in a random
number of cells. The long time behavior of the structured population is then
linked and derived from the behavior a well chosen SDE (monotype population).

Integrating over this parameter space, we measure an occurrence rate of F=0.77

range of 0.01<zeta_1<2, where zeta_1 is defined as the number of planets per

large-scale shock wave, on the statistics of temperature in compressible
turbulence were investigated by simulations. The shocklet and shock wave are
caused by the solenoidal and compressive modes of driven forces, respectively.
Hereafter, the related two flows are called as SFT and CFT, respectively. It
shows that in SFT the temperature spectrum follows the k^-5/3 power law, and
the temperature field has ""ramp-cliff"" structures. By contrast, in CFT the
temperature spectrum obeys the k^-2 power law, and the temperature field is
dominated by large-scale rarefaction and compression. The power-law exponents
for the p.d.f. of large negative dilatation are -2.5 in SFT and -3.5 in CFT,
close to theoretical values. For the isentropic assumption of thermodynamic
variables, the derivation in SFT grows with the turbulent Mach number (Mt), and
for same Mt, the variables in CFT are more anisentropic. The angle statistics
shows that the temperature gradient in CFT is preferentially perpendicular to
the anisotropic strain rate tensor. It tends to be parallel with the first
eigenvector and be orthogonal with the other two eigenvectors. For the cascade
of temperature, the temperature variance is increased by the viscous
dissipation and the pressure-dilatation, but is decreased by the SGS
temperature flux. The statistics of pressure-dilatation proves that the
negligible contribution of pressure-dilatation at small scales is due to the
cancelations of high values between rarefaction and compression regions. The
strongly positive skewness of the p.d.f.s of pressure-dilatation implies that
the conversion from kinetic to internal energy through compression is more
intense than the opposite process through rarefaction. Furthermore, in SFT the
fluctuations of pressure-dilatation approximately follow the Zeman model.

Games are known to be in the intersection of NP and co-NP, which is not known
for max-closed semilinear constraints. Semilinear relations that are max-closed
and additionally closed under translations have been called tropically convex
in the literature. One of our main results is a new duality for open tropically
convex relations, which puts the CSP for tropically convex semilinaer
constraints in general into NP intersected co-NP. This extends the
corresponding complexity result for scheduling under and-or precedence
constraints, or equivalently the max-atoms problem. To this end, we present a
characterization of max-closed semilinear relations in terms of syntactically
restricted first-order logic, and another characterization in terms of a finite
set of relations L that allow primitive positive definitions of all other
relations in the class. We also present a subclass of max-closed constraints
where the CSP is in P; this class generalizes the class of max-closed
constraints over finite domains, and the feasibility problem for max-closed
linear inequalities. Finally, we show that the class of max-closed semilinear
constraints is maximal in the sense that as soon as a single relation that is
not max-closed is added to L, the CSP becomes NP-hard.

of liquid argon time projection chambers, which are often used as neutrino and
dark matter detectors. We have made systematic measurements of breakdown
voltages in liquid argon along insulators surrounding negative rod electrodes
where the breakdown is initiated at the anode. The measurements were performed
in an open cryostat filled with commercial grade liquid argon exposed to air,
and not the ultra-pure argon required for electron drift. While not addressing
all high voltage concerns in liquid argon, these measurements have direct
relevance to the design of high voltage feedthroughs especially for averting
the common problem of flash-over breakdown. The purpose of these tests is to
understand the effects of materials, of breakdown path length, and of surface
topology for this geometry and setup. We have found that the only
material-specific effects are those due to their permittivity. We have found
that the breakdown voltage has no dependence on the length of the exposed
insulator. A model for the breakdown mechanism is presented that can help
inform future designs.

conformal invariance is broken but the magnetic and electric susceptibilities
are not bound to coincide. We analyze the formation of large-scale magnetic
fields in slow-roll inflation and find that they are generated at the level of
a few hundredths of a nG and over typical length scales between few Mpc and
$100$ Mpc. Using a new time parametrization that reduces to conformal time but
only for coincident susceptibilities, the gauge action is quantized while the
evolution equations of the corresponding mode functions are more easily
solvable. The power spectra depend on the normalized rates of variation of the
two susceptibilities (or of the corresponding gauge couplings) and on the
absolute value of their ratio at the beginning of inflation. We pin down
explicit regions in the parameter space where all the physical requirements
(i.e. the backreaction constraints, the magnetogenesis bounds and the
naturalness of the initial conditions of the scenario) are jointly satisfied.
Weakly coupled initial data are favoured if the gauge couplings are of the same
order at the end of inflation. Duality is systematically used to simplify the
analysis of the wide parameter space of the model.

find that branch-points accumulate at the valleys while end-points on the

similarity both photometrically and spectroscopically. Optical spectra were
obtained as early as 0.26 days post maximum, and again confirm the nova nature
of the eruption. A significant deceleration of the inferred ejecta expansion
velocity is observed which may be caused by interaction of the ejecta with
surrounding material, possibly a red giant wind. We find a low ejected mass and
low ejection velocity, which are consistent with high mass-accretion rate, high
mass white dwarf, and short recurrence time models of novae. We encourage
additional observations, especially around the predicted time of the next
eruption, towards the end of 2015.

support a gradual path to certified programming. We explore gradual certified
programming in Coq, providing the possibility to postpone the proofs of
selected properties, and to check ""at runtime"" whether the properties actually
hold. Casts can be integrated with the implicit coercion mechanism of Coq to
support implicit cast insertion a la gradual typing. Additionally, when
extracting Coq functions to mainstream languages, our encoding of casts
supports lifting assumed properties into runtime checks. Much to our surprise,
it is not necessary to extend Coq in any way to support gradual certified
programming. A simple mix of type classes and axioms makes it possible to bring
gradual certified programming to Coq in a straightforward manner.

reaction proceeds in time. Such models are sufficient for describing state
transitions in a reaction where coherences between different states do not
arise, or in other words, a reaction which contain only incoherent transitions.
A prominent example reaction containing coherent transitions is the
radical-pair model. The kinetics of such reactions is defined by the so-called
reaction operator which determines the radical-pair state as a function of
intermediate transition rates. We argue that the well-known concept of quantum
walks from quantum information theory is a natural and apt framework for
describing multisite chemical reactions. By composing Kraus maps that act only
on two sites at a time, we show how the quantum-walk formalism can be applied
to derive a reaction operator for the standard avian radical-pair reaction. Our
reaction operator predicts a recombination dephasing rate consistent with
recent experiments [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 139}, 234309 (2013)], in contrast to
previous work by Jones and Hore [Chem. Phys. Lett. {\bf 488}, 90 (2010)]. The
standard radical-pair reaction has conventionally been described by either a
normalised density operator incorporating both the radical pair and reaction
products, or by a trace-decreasing density operator that considers only the
radical pair. We demonstrate a density operator that is both normalised and
refers only to radical-pair states. Generalisations to include additional
dephasing processes and an arbitrary number of sites are also discussed.

algorithm is proposed as a solution alternative that relies on: (i) The use of
local stochastic averaging gradients. (ii) Determination of descent steps as
differences of consecutive stochastic averaging gradients. Strong convexity of
local functions and Lipschitz continuity of local gradients is shown to
guarantee linear convergence of the sequence generated by DSA in expectation.
Local iterates are further shown to approach the optimal argument for almost
all realizations. The expected linear convergence of DSA is in contrast to the
sublinear rate characteristic of existing methods for decentralized stochastic

conclude that if a multi-energy x-ray measurement of any K-edge material
contains a signal of any other material, then there will be a positive
concentration of that K-edge material below which its K-edge cannot be observed
without extracting the K-edge signal through means of basis decomposition.
Mathematical descriptions of this limiting minimum concentration is provided in
three cases - multi-energy radiographic projection images; and reconstructed
multi-energy CT images for both linear attenuation and Hounsfield units. Two
important properties of this limiting concentration are provided: the minimum
concentration for Hounsfield units is always strictly less than the minimum
concentration for linear attenuation; and the minimum concentration for
radiographic projections will typically be much larger than the minimum
concentration for reconstructed linear attenuation. Finally experimental
observation of this phenomenon is presented using data collected by the MARS
spectral CT scanner equipped with a CdTe Medipix-3RX camera operating in
charge-summing mode, where it is also shown that the K-edge can be recovered
through basis decomposition.

extensive applications in active sensing and communication systems. In this
paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the weighted integrated sidelobe
level (WISL), which can be used to design sequences with impulse-like
autocorrelation and zero (or low) correlation zone. Two algorithms based on the
general majorization-minimization method are developed to tackle the WISL
minimization problem and the convergence to a stationary point is guaranteed.
In addition, the proposed algorithms can be implemented via fast Fourier
transform (FFT) operations and thus are computationally efficient, and an
acceleration scheme has been considered to further accelerate the algorithms.
Moreover, the proposed methods are extended to optimize the $\ell_{p}$-norm of
the autocorrelation sidelobes, which lead to a way to minimize the peak
sidelobe level (PSL) criterion. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
algorithms can efficiently generate sequences with virtually zero
autocorrelation sidelobes in a specified lag interval and can also produce very
long sequences with much smaller PSL compared with some well known analytical
sequences.

observational data have long been available for the Milky Way (e.g. Freeman

formation models (e.g. Abadi et al. 2003, Bekki $\&$ Chiba 2001). An implicit
assumption still remains unanswered though: is the Milky Way a ""normal"" spiral?
Searching for directions, it feels natural to look at our neighbour: Andromeda.
An intriguing piece of the puzzle is provided by contrasting its stellar halo
with that of our Galaxy, even more so since Mouhcine et al. (2005) have
suggested that a correlation between stellar halo metallicity and galactic
luminosity is in place and would leave the Milky Way halo as an outlier with
respect to other spirals of comparable luminosities. Further questions hence
arise: is there any stellar halo-galaxy formation symbiosis? Our first step has
been to contrast the chemical evolution of the Milky Way with that of Andromeda
by means of a semi-analytic model. We have then pursued a complementary
approach through the analysis of several semi-cosmological late-type galaxy
simulations which sample a wide variety of merging histories. We have focused
on the stellar halo properties in the simulations at redshift zero and shown
that - at any given galaxy luminosity - the metallicities of the stellar halos
in the simulations span a range in excess of $\sim$ 1 dex, a result which is
strengthened by the robustness tests we have performed. We suggest that the
underlying driver of the halo metallicity dispersion can be traced to the
diversity of galactic mass assembly histories inherent within the hierarchical
clustering paradigm.

Here, replacing the capacitor in circuit electromechanics by a superconducting

coupling regime at the single photon level with feasible experimental

the sun, radiation pressure stimulated remarkable discoveries in
electromagnetism, quantum physics and relativity [1,2]. This phenomenon plays a
crucial role in a variety of systems, from atomic [3-5] to astronomical [6]
scales. The pressure of light is associated with the momentum of photons, and
it is usually assumed that both the optical momentum and the radiation-pressure
force are naturally aligned with the propagation of light, i.e., its
wavevector. Here we report the direct observation of an extraordinary optical
momentum and force directed perpendicular to the wavevector, and proportional
to the optical spin (i.e., degree of circular polarization). Such optical force
was recently predicted for evanescent waves [7] and other structured fields
[8]. It can be associated with the enigmatic ""spin-momentum"" part of the
Poynting vector, which was introduced by Belinfante in field theory 75 years
ago [9-11]. We measure this unusual transverse momentum using a nano-cantilever
capable of femto-Newton resolution, which is immersed in an evanescent optical
field above the total-internal-reflecting glass surface. Furthermore, the
transverse force we measure exhibits another polarization-dependent
contribution determined by the imaginary part of the complex Poynting vector.
By revealing new types of optical forces in structured fields, our experimental
findings revisit fundamental momentum properties of light and bring a new twist
to optomechanics.

geometries in the space of positive densities -- it quantifies the cost of
transporting a mass distribution into another. In particular, it provides
natural options for interpolation of distributions (displacement interpolation)
and for modeling flows. As such it has been the cornerstone of recent
developments in physics, probability theory, image processing, time-series
analysis, and several other fields. In spite of extensive work and theoretical
developments, the computation of OMT for large scale problems has remained a
challenging task. An alternative framework for interpolating distributions,
rooted in statistical mechanics and large deviations, is that of Schroedinger
bridges (entropic interpolation). This may be seen as a stochastic
regularization of OMT and can be cast as the stochastic control problem of
steering the probability density of the state-vector of a dynamical system
between two marginals. In this approach, however, the actual computation of
flows had hardly received any attention. In recent work on Schroedinger bridges
for Markov chains and quantum evolutions, we noted that the solution can be
efficiently obtained from the fixed-point of a map which is contractive in the
Hilbert metric. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to show that a similar
approach can be taken in the context of diffusion processes which i) leads to a
new proof of a classical result on Schroedinger bridges and ii) provides an
efficient computational scheme for both, Schroedinger bridges and OMT. We
illustrate this new computational approach by obtaining interpolation of
densities in representative examples such as interpolation of images.

investigate the influence of spray formulation type and leaf character
(wettability) on shatter, bounce and adhesion of droplets impacting with
cotton, rice and wheat leaves. Impaction criteria that allow for different
angles of the leaf surface and the droplet impact trajectory are presented;
their predictions are based on whether combinations of droplet size and
velocity lie above or below bounce and shatter boundaries. In the experimental
component, real leaves are used, with all their inherent natural variability.
Further, commercial agricultural spray nozzles are employed, resulting in a
range of droplet characteristics. Given this natural variability, there is
broad agreement between the data and predictions. As predicted, the shatter of
droplets was found to increase as droplet size and velocity increased, and the
surface became harder to wet. Bouncing of droplets occurred most frequently on
hard to wet surfaces with high surface tension mixtures. On the other hand, a
number of small droplets with low impact velocity were observed to bounce when
predicted to lie well within the adhering regime. We believe this discrepancy
between the predictions and experimental data could be due to air layer effects
that were not taken into account in the current bounce equations. Other
discrepancies between experiment and theory are thought to be due to the
current assumption of a dry impact surface, whereas, in practice, the leaf
surfaces became increasingly covered with fluid throughout the spray test runs.

admission control problems, where a system manager is allowed to divert
incoming jobs up to a fixed rate, in order to minimize the queueing delay
experienced by the admitted jobs.
  Spencer et al. (2014) show that the system's delay performance can be
significantly improved by having access to future information in the form of a
lookahead window, during which the times of future arrivals and services are
revealed. They prove that, while delay under an optimal online policy diverges
to infinity in the heavy-traffic regime, it can stay bounded by making use of
future information. However, the diversion polices of Spencer et al. (2014)
require the length of the lookahead window to grow to infinity at a non-trivial
rate in the heavy-traffic regime, and it remained open whether substantial
performance improvement could still be achieved with less future information.
  We resolve this question to a large extent by establishing an asymptotically
tight lower bound on how much future information is necessary to achieve
superior performance, which matches the upper bound of Spencer et al. (2014) up
to a constant multiplicative factor. Our result hence demonstrates that the
system's heavy-traffic delay performance is highly sensitive to the amount of
future information available. Our proof is based on analyzing certain excursion
probabilities of the input sample paths, and exploiting a connection between a
policy's diversion decisions and subsequent server idling, which may be of
independent interest for related dynamic resource allocation problems.

potential, corresponding to AdS vacua in the theory. One of these, which breaks
all supersymmetries but is nonetheless stable, is new. It exists only when
$\omega\ne 0$. We construct supersymmetric domain wall solutions in the
truncated theory, and we give a detailed analysis of their holographic dual
interpretations using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Domain walls where the
pseudoscalars vanish were studied previously, but those with non-vanishing
pseudoscalars, which we analyse numerically, are new. The pseudoscalars are
associated with supersymmetric mass deformations in the CFT duals. When
$\omega$ is zero, the solutions can be lifted to M-theory, where they approach
the Coulomb-branch flows of dielectric M5-branes wrapped on $S^3$ in the deep
IR.

with the goal of minimizing computational cost through linear compression. This
idea was originally proposed for CMB purposes by Tegmark et al.\ (1997), and
here we develop it into a fully working computational framework for large-scale
polarization analysis, adopting \WMAP\ as a worked example. We compare five
different linear bases (pixel space, harmonic space, noise covariance
eigenvectors, signal-to-noise covariance eigenvectors and signal-plus-noise
covariance eigenvectors) in terms of compression efficiency, and find that the
computationally most efficient basis is the signal-to-noise eigenvector basis,
which is closely related to the Karhunen-Loeve and Principal Component
transforms, in agreement with previous suggestions. For this basis, the
information in 6836 unmasked \WMAP\ sky map pixels can be compressed into a
smaller set of 3102 modes, with a maximum error increase of any single
multipole of 3.8\% at $\ell\le32$, and a maximum shift in the mean values of a
joint distribution of an amplitude--tilt model of 0.006$\sigma$. This
compression reduces the computational cost of a single likelihood evaluation by
a factor of 5, from 38 to 7.5 CPU seconds, and it also results in a more robust
likelihood by implicitly regularizing nearly degenerate modes. Finally, we use
the same compression framework to formulate a numerically stable and
computationally efficient variation of the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood
implementation that requires less than 3 GB of memory and 2 CPU minutes per
iteration for $\ell \le 32$, rendering low-$\ell$ QML CMB power spectrum
analysis fully tractable on a standard laptop.

computational imaging technique that circumvents this limit by fusing
information from multiple images taken with different illumination angles. The
result is a gigapixel-scale image having both wide FOV and high resolution,
i.e. large space-bandwidth product (SBP). FPM has enormous potential for
revolutionizing microscopy and has already found application in digital
pathology. However, it suffers from long acquisition times (on the order of
minutes), limiting throughput. Faster capture times would not only improve
imaging speed, but also allow studies of live samples, where motion artifacts
degrade results. In contrast to fixed (e.g. pathology) slides, live samples are
continuously evolving at various spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present
a new source coding scheme, along with real-time hardware control, to achieve
0.8 NA resolution across a 4x FOV with sub-second capture times. We propose an
improved algorithm and new initialization scheme, which allow robust phase
reconstruction over long time-lapse experiments. We present the first FPM

surfaces may stick at the boundary of the domain, even when the domain is
smooth and convex. This is a purely nonlocal phenomenon, and it is in sharp

enough.
  When the fractional parameter is small, the sticking effects may become more

minimizers in a slab to stick at the boundary, by a quantity that is
proportional to a power of the perturbation.
