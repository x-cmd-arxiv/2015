and an inherent utility that is revealed only once we commit to selecting it.
Given a budget on the cumulative cost of the selected items, how can we pick a
subset of maximal value? This task generalizes several important problems such
as multi-arm bandits, active search and the knapsack problem. We present an
algorithm, GP-Select, which utilizes prior knowledge about similarity be- tween
items, expressed as a kernel function. GP-Select uses Gaussian process
prediction to balance exploration (estimating the unknown value of items) and
exploitation (selecting items of high value). We extend GP-Select to be able to
discover sets that simultaneously have high utility and are diverse. Our
preference for diversity can be specified as an arbitrary monotone submodular
function that quantifies the diminishing returns obtained when selecting
similar items. Furthermore, we exploit the structure of the model updates to
achieve an order of magnitude (up to 40X) speedup in our experiments without
resorting to approximations. We provide strong guarantees on the performance of
GP-Select and apply it to three real-world case studies of industrial
relevance: (1) Refreshing a repository of prices in a Global Distribution
System for the travel industry, (2) Identifying diverse, binding-affine
peptides in a vaccine de- sign task and (3) Maximizing clicks in a web-scale
recommender system by recommending items to users.

excellent fits to the latest observational data, are based on the Poincare disk
hyperbolic geometry. We refine these models by constructing Kahler potentials
with built-in inflaton shift symmetry and by making a canonical choice of the
goldstino Kahler potential. The refined models are stable with respect to all
scalar fields at all $\alpha$, no additional stabilization terms are required.
The scalar potential V has a nearly Minkowski minimum at small values of the
inflaton field $\varphi$, and an infinitely long dS valley of constant depth
and width at large $\varphi$. Because of the infinite length of this
shift-symmetric valley, the initial value of the inflaton field at the Planck
density is expected to be extremely large. We show that the inflaton field
$\varphi$ does not change much until all fields lose their energy and fall to
the bottom of the dS valley at large $\varphi$. This provides natural initial
conditions for inflation driven by the inflaton field slowly rolling along the
dS valley towards the minimum of the potential at small $\varphi$. A detailed
description of this process is given for $\alpha$-attractors in supergravity,
but we believe that our general conclusions concerning naturalness of initial
conditions for inflation are valid for a broad class of inflationary models
with sufficiently flat potentials.

a high velocity component with expansion velocities of > 20, 000 km/s during

conduct a kinematic analysis of the GC population and find tentative evidence
for weak net rotation of the GC system, in the same sense as that exhibited by
the underlying spheroid. The most likely amplitude of rotation is ~10 km/s,
approximately half the magnitude of the observed velocity dispersion. Finally,
we use the GCs to estimate the dynamical mass of NGC 6822 within 11 kpc and we
formally find it to be in the range between (3-4)10^9 Msun. This implies an
overall mass-to-light ratio in the range of ~ 30-40 and indicates that NGC 6822

out of a star cluster in a triaxial isochrone potential containing a sub-halo
population reproduces many of the orbital effects of more general cosmological
halos but allows easy calculation of orbital actions. We employ a spherical
shell code which we show accurately reproduces the results of a tree gravity
code for a collisionless star cluster. Streams from clusters on high
eccentricity orbits, $e\gtrsim 0.6$, can spread out so much that the amount of
material at high enough surface density to stand out on the sky may be only a
few percent of the stream's total mass. Low eccentricity streams remain more
spatially coherent, but sub-halos both broaden the stream and displace the
centerline with details depending on the orbits allowed within the potential.
Overall, the majority of stream particles have changes in their total actions
of only 1-2\%, leaving the mean stream relatively undisturbed. A halo with 1\%
of the mass in sub-halos typically spreads the velocity distribution about a
factor of two wider than would be expected for a smooth halo. Strong density
variations, ""gaps"", along with mean velocity offsets, are clearly detected in
low eccentricity streams for even a 0.2\% sub-halo mass fraction. Around one
hundred velocity measurements per kiloparsec of stream will enable tests for
the presence of a local sub-halo density as small as 0.2-0.5\% of the local
mass density, with about 1\% predicted for 30 kiloparsec orbital radii streams.

long-wavelength gravitational waves (GW) in the form of the
Tensor-Scalar-Scalar (TSS) bispectrum. This correlation affects the
mass-distribution in the Universe and leads to the off-diagonal correlations of
the density field modes in the form of the quadrupole anisotropy.
Interestingly, this effect survives even after the tensor mode decays when it
re-enters the horizon, known as the fossil effect. As a result, the
off-diagonal correlation function between different Fourier modes of the
density fluctuations can be thought as a way to probe the large-scale GW and
the mechanism of inflation behind the fossil effect. Models of single field
slow roll inflation generically predict a very small quadrupole anisotropy in
TSS while in models of multiple fields inflation this effect can be observable.
Therefore this large scale quadrupole anisotropy can be thought as a
spectroscopy for different inflationary models. In addition, in models of
anisotropic inflation there exists quadrupole anisotropy in curvature
perturbation power spectrum. Here we consider TSS in models of anisotropic
inflation and show that the shape of quadrupole anisotropy is different than in
single field models. In addition in these models the quadrupole anisotropy is
projected into the preferred direction and its amplitude is proportional to
$g_* N_e$ where $N_e$ is the number of e-folds and $g_*$ is the amplitude of
quadrupole anisotropy in curvature perturbation power spectrum. We use this
correlation function to estimate the large scale GW as well as the preferred
direction and discuss the detectability of the signal in the galaxy surveys
like Euclid and 21 cm surveys.

Due to limitations of coverage and data quality, and the biases inherent in

discuss the catalog completeness, and comment on the new shells' relationship
with known interstellar structure as warranted. Unlike many previous catalogs,
this sample is not biased towards expanding shells. Where possible we also
estimate the kinematic distances, physical sizes, expansion velocities, and
energies of these shells. Overall, they are relatively large and old, each the
result of multiple supernovae. Unlike previous surveys, we do not find that the

Renyi entropic quantities put forward in [Berta et al., Phys. Rev. A 91, 022333
(2015)]. What distinguishes the swiveled Renyi entropies from the prior
proposal of Berta et al. is that there is an extra degree of freedom: an
optimization over unitary rotations with respect to particular fixed bases
(swivels). A consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveled
Renyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the Renyi family
of entropies. The swiveled Renyi entropies are however generally discontinuous
at $\alpha=1$ and do not converge to the von Neumann entropy-based measures in
the limit as $\alpha\rightarrow1$, instead bounding them from above and below.
Particular variants reduce to known Renyi entropies, such as the Renyi relative
entropy or the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, but also lead to ordered
Renyi conditional mutual informations and ordered Renyi generalizations of a
relative entropy difference. Refinements of entropy inequalities such as
monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as a
consequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled Renyi entropies.
Due to the lack of convergence at $\alpha=1$, it is unclear whether the
swiveled Renyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, so
that the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal.

complex social systems. To capture the complex nature of social influencing we
investigate numerically and analytically the transition in the behavior of
threshold-limited cascades in the presence of multiple initiators as the
distribution of thresholds is varied between the two extreme cases of identical
thresholds and a uniform distribution. We accomplish this by employing a
truncated normal distribution of the nodes' thresholds and observe a
non-monotonic change in the cascade size as we vary the standard deviation.
Further, for a sufficiently large spread in the threshold distribution, the
tipping-point behavior of the social influencing process disappears and is
replaced by a smooth crossover governed by the size of initiator set. We
demonstrate that for a given size of the initiator set, there is a specific
variance of the threshold distribution for which an opinion spreads optimally.
Furthermore, in the case of synthetic graphs we show that the spread
asymptotically becomes independent of the system size, and that global cascades
can arise just by the addition of a single node to the initiator set.

objects inside the habitable zone (hereafter HZ). In this study, we make a
comparison of several binary star systems and their efficiency to move icy
asteroids from beyond the snow-line into orbits crossing the HZ. We modeled a
belt of 10000 asteroids (remnants from the late phase of planetary formation
process) beyond the snow-line. The planetesimals are placed randomly around the
primary star and move under the gravitational influence of the two stars and a
gas giant. As the planetesimals do not interact with each other, we divided the
belt into 100 subrings which were separately integrated. In this statistical
study, several double star configurations with a G-type star as primary are
investigated. Our results show that small bodies also participate in bearing a
non-negligible amount of water to the HZ. The proximity of a companion moving
on an eccentric orbit increases the flux of asteroids to the HZ, which could
result into a more efficient water transport on a short timescale, causing a
heavy bombardment. In contrast to asteroids moving under the gravitational
perturbations of one G-type star and a gas giant, we show that the presence of

spin/valley polarization dynamics of resident carriers in electron (or hole)

electron-doped MoS_2 and WS_2 monolayers using optical Kerr spectroscopy, and
unambiguously reveal very long electron spin lifetimes exceeding 3ns at 5K (2-3
orders of magnitude longer than typical exciton recombination times). In
contrast with conventional III-V or II-VI semiconductors, spin relaxation
accelerates rapidly in small transverse magnetic fields. Supported by a model

a long-lived spin coherence is observed at lower energies, commensurate with

support this conjecture by a brane construction for two jordanian examples,
corresponding to noncommutative spaces with [x^-,x^i] ~ x^i (i=1,2). We also
discuss kappa-Minkowski type deformations of AdS_5 x S^5, one of which may be

beyond 3.5 AU from the Sun and migrated as close as 1.5 AU until it encountered
an orbital resonance with Saturn. Both planets then supposedly migrated outward
for several $10^5$ yr, with Jupiter ending up at ~5 AU. The initial conditions
of the GT and the timing between Jupiter's migration and the formation of the
Galilean satellites remain unexplored. We study the formation of Ganymede and
Callisto, both of which consist of ~50% H$_2$O and rock, in the GT scenario. We
examine why they lack dense atmospheres, while Titan is surrounded by a thick
N$_2$ envelope. We model an axially symmetric circumplanetary disk (CPD) in
hydrostatic equilibrium around Jupiter. The CPD is warmed by viscous heating,
Jupiter's luminosity, accretional heating, and the Sun. The position of the
H$_2$O ice line in the CPD, which is crucial for the formation of massive
moons, is computed at various solar distances. We assess the loss of Galilean
atmospheres due to high-energy radiation from the young Sun. Ganymede and
Callisto cannot have accreted their H$_2$O during Jupiter's supposed GT,
because its CPD (if still active) was too warm to host ices and much smaller
than Ganymede's contemporary orbit. From a thermal perspective, the Galilean
moons might have had significant atmospheres, but these would probably have
been eroded during the GT in < $10^5$ yr by solar XUV radiation. Jupiter and
the Galilean moons formed beyond 4.5 (+/- 0.5) AU and prior to the proposed GT.
Thereafter, Jupiter's CPD would have been dry, and delayed accretion of
planetesimals should have created water-rich Io and Europa. While Galilean
atmospheres would have been lost during the GT, Titan would have formed after
Saturn's own tack, because Saturn still accreted substantially for ~$10^6$ yr
after its closest solar approach, ending up at about 7 AU.

activity onto supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
peaks in the hard X-ray band (30 keV). In this paper, we identify a significant
selection effect operating on the CXB and flux-limited AGN surveys, and outline
how they must depend heavily on the spin distribution of black holes. We show
that, due to the higher radiative efficiency of rapidly-spinning black holes,
they will be over-represented in the X-ray background, and therefore could be a
dominant contributor to the CXB. Using a simple bimodal spin distribution, we
demonstrate that only 15 per cent maximally-spinning AGN can produce 50 per
cent of the CXB. We also illustrate that invoking a small population of
maximally-spinning black holes in CXB synthesis models can reproduce the CXB
peak without requiring large numbers of Compton-thick AGN. The spin bias is
even more pronounced for flux-limited surveys: 7 per cent of sources with
maximally-spinning black holes can produce half of the source counts. The
detectability for maximum spin black holes can be further boosted in hard (>10
keV) X-rays by up to ~60 per cent due to pronounced ionised reflection,
reducing the percentage of maximally spinning black holes required to produce
half of the CXB or survey number counts further. A host of observations are
consistent with an over-representation of high-spin black holes. Future NuSTAR
and ASTRO-H hard X-ray surveys will provide the best constraints on the role of
spin within the AGN population.

the spectra of the background quasar Q 0122-003 at an impact parameter of 163

multicomponent structure with ultra-strong, wide velocity spread OVI (logN =

absorption components are well explained as arising in a low density (10^{-4.2}
cm^{-3}), diffuse (10 kpc), cool (10^4 K) photoionized gas with a super-solar
metallicity ([X/H] > 0.3). From the observed narrowness of the Lyb profile, the
non-detection of SIV absorption, and the presence of strong CIV absorption we
rule out equilibrium/non-equilibrium collisional ionization models. The
low-ionization photoionized gas with a density of 10^{-2.5} cm^{-3} and a
metallicity of [X/H] > -1.4 is possibly tracing recycled halo gas. We estimate
an outflow mass of ~2x10^{10} Msun, a mass-flow rate of ~54 Msun/yr, a kinetic
luminosity of ~9x10^{41} erg/s, and a mass loading factor of ~8 for the
outflowing high-ionization gas. These are consistent with the properties of

we use the halo occupation distribution formalism to estimate the number of

arising from the DM clustering and WIMP microscopic properties, which set the
DM gamma-ray emission. The use of different catalogues probing objects at
different redshifts reduces significantly, though not completely, the
degeneracy among the different gamma-ray components. We find that the presence
of a significant WIMP DM signal is allowed by the data but not significantly
preferred by the fit, although this is mainly due to a degeneracy with the
misaligned AGN component. With modest substructure boost, the sensitivity of
this method excludes thermal annihilation cross sections at 95% C.L. for WIMP

actual existence has eluded a firm observational confirmation. We present a
novel experiment to detect the WHIM, by targeting the putative filaments
connecting galaxy clusters. We use HST/COS to observe a remarkable QSO
sightline that passes within $\Delta d = 3$ Mpc from the 7 inter-cluster axes
connecting 7 independent cluster-pairs at redshifts $0.1 \le z \le 0.5$. We
find tentative excesses of total HI, narrow HI (NLA; Doppler parameters $b<50$
km/s), broad HI (BLA; $b \ge 50$ km/s) and OVI absorption lines within
rest-frame velocities of $\Delta v \lesssim 1000$ km/s from the cluster-pairs
redshifts, corresponding to $\sim 2$, $\sim 1.7$, $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ times
their field expectations, respectively. Although the excess of OVI likely comes
from gas close to individual galaxies, we conclude that most of the excesses of
NLAs and BLAs are truly intergalactic. We find that the covering fractions,
$f_c$, of BLAs close to cluster-pairs are $\sim 4-7$ times higher than the
random expectation (at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ c.l.), whereas the $f_c$ of NLAs and
OVI are not significantly enhanced. We argue that a larger relative excess of
BLAs compared to those of NLAs close to cluster-pairs may be a signature of the
WHIM in inter-cluster filaments. By extending the present analysis to tens of
sightlines our experiment offers a promising route to detect the WHIM.

considering compositional gradients, but unstable when ignoring them - is shown
to have the greatest potential impact on main sequence stars with masses in the
range 1.2 - 1.7 solar masses. We present the first stellar evolution
calculations using a prescription for semiconvection derived from extrapolation
of direct numerical simulations of double-diffusive mixing down to stellar
parameters. The dominant mode of semiconvection in stars is layered
semiconvection, where the layer height is an adjustable parameter analogous to
the mixing length in convection. The rate of mixing across the semiconvective
region is sensitively dependent on the layer height. We find that there is a
critical layer height that separates weak semiconvective mixing (where
evolution is well-approximated by using the Ledoux criterion) from strong
semiconvective mixing (where evolution is well-approximated by using the
Schwarzschild criterion). This critical layer height is much smaller than the
minimum layer height expected from simulations so we predict that for realistic
layer heights, the evolution is nearly the same as a model ran with the
Schwarzschild criterion. We also investigate the effects of compositional
gradient smoothing, finding that it causes convective cores to artificially
shrink in the absence of additional mixing beyond the convective boundary.
Layered semiconvection with realistic layer heights provides enough such mixing
that stars will still evolve as if the Schwarzschild criterion is employed.
Finally, we discuss the potential of detecting such semiconvection and its
implication on convective core sizes in solar-like oscillators.

constraining the bright end of high redshift UV luminosity functions (LFs).
However, the lack of HST 1.05-micron observations over the CANDELS fields has
made it difficult to identify z~9-10 sources robustly, since such data are
needed to confirm the presence of an abrupt Lyman break at 1.2 microns. We
report here on the successful identification of many such z~9-10 sources from a
new HST program (z9-CANDELS) that targets the highest-probability z~9-10 galaxy
candidates with observations at 1.05 microns, to search for a robust
Lyman-break at 1.2 microns. The potential z~9-10 candidates are preselected
from the full HST, Spitzer/IRAC S-CANDELS observations, and the
deepest-available ground-based optical+near-infrared observations. We
identified 15 credible z~9-10 galaxies over the CANDELS fields. Nine of these
galaxies lie at z~9 and 5 are new identifications. Our targeted follow-up
strategy has proven to be very efficient in making use of scarce HST time to
secure a reliable sample of z~9-10 galaxies. Through extensive simulations, we
replicate the selection process for our sample (both the preselection and
follow-up) and use it to improve current estimates for the volume density of

behaviors of entanglement that come into view decay, sudden death, sudden birth

generated from any of theses suggested systems are much fragile than the
partially entangled ones. The systems of larger dimensions are more robust than
those of smaller dimensions systems, where the entanglement decay smoothly,
gradually and may vanish for a very short time. For the class of $2\times 3$

the two parameters family. Although the entanglement of driven $ 2 \times 3$

billion years. Though still less than the Hubble time, this helps in making the
spiral structure more long-lived. Further we show that addition of gas is
essential to get a stable wave for the observed pattern speed for the Galaxy,
which otherwise is not possible for a one-component stellar disc.

$(2+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory on M2 branes in the UV to a
$(3+1)$-dimensional field theory on intersecting M5 branes in the infra-red.
The M2 branes completely polarize into M5 branes along the flow and the
Poincar\'e sections of the $\widehat{AdS_5}$ are the $(3+1)$-dimensional common
intersection of the M5 branes. The emergence of the extra dimension in the
infra-red suggests a new strongly-coupled phase of the M2 brane and ABJM
theories in which charged solitons are becoming massless. The flow solution is
first analyzed by finding a four-dimensional $N \! = \! 2$ supersymmetric flow
in $N \! = \! 8$ gauged supergravity. This is then generalized to a one
parameter family of non-supersymmetric flows. The infra-red limit of the
solutions appears to be quite singular in four dimensions but the uplift to
eleven-dimensional supergravity is remarkable and regular (up to orbifolding).
Our construction is a non-trivial application of the recently derived uplift
formulae for fluxes, going well beyond the earlier constructions of stationary
points solutions. The eleven-dimensional supersymmetry is also analyzed and
shows how, for the supersymmetric flow, the M2-brane supersymmetry in the UV is
polarized entirely into M5-brane supersymmetry in the infra-red.

first challenge is that for most residential buildings a description of the

overcome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with

the graphene plane, a dynamic and inhomogeneous texture of the N\'eel vector
lying within the plane should mediate (nearly dissipationless) superfluid
transport of spin angular momentum polarized along the $z$ axis, which could
serve as a strong support for the canted antiferromagnet scenario. Spin
injection and detection can be achieved by coupling two spin-polarized edge
channels of the $|\nu|=2$ quantum Hall state on two opposite ends of the
$\nu=0$ region. A simple kinetic theory and Onsager reciprocity are invoked to
model the spin injection and detection processes, and the transport of spin
through the antiferromagnet is accounted for using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert

operates by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a

acquire new knowledge, Quizz also incorporates questions for which we do not
have a known answer; the answers given by competent users provide useful
signals for selecting the correct answers for these questions. Quizz actively
tries to identify knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising
campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting capabilities of existing,
publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies the contributions
of the users using information theory and sends feedback to the
advertisingsystem about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting
mechanism to further optimize ad placement.
  Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand users, confirm that we can
crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized topics, as the
advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired expertise
and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that examine
the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for having
short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute.
Finally, our cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is
below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while
offering the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential
users all over the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized
expertise that is not typically available through existing labor marketplaces.

highly-redundant robots to achieve unified motion/force control of one or more
operational space objectives while adhering to physical constraints. Limited
studies exist on the software architecture and APIs that enable WBOSC to
perform and be integrated into a larger system. In this paper we address this
by presenting ControlIt!, a new open-source software framework for WBOSC.
Unlike previous implementations, ControlIt! is multi-threaded to increase servo
frequencies on standard PC hardware. A new parameter binding mechanism enables
tight integration between ControlIt! and external processes via an extensible
set of transport protocols. To support a new robot, only two plugins and a URDF
model needs to be provided --- the rest of ControlIt! remains unchanged. New
WBC primitives can be added by writing a Task or Constraint plugin.
ControlIt!'s capabilities are demonstrated on Dreamer, a 16-DOF torque
controlled humanoid upper body robot containing both series elastic and
co-actuated joints, and using it to perform a product disassembly task. Using
this testbed, we show that ControlIt! can achieve average servo latencies of
about 0.5ms when configured with two Cartesian position tasks, two orientation
tasks, and a lower priority posture task. This is significantly higher than the
5ms that was achieved using UTA-WBC, the prototype implementation of WBOSC that
is both application and platform-specific. Variations in the product's position
is handled by updating the goal of the Cartesian position task. ControlIt!'s
source code is released under an LGPL license and we hope it will be adopted
and maintained by the WBC community for the long term as a platform for WBC
development and integration.

to reconstruct the underlying distribution of observables for analyses. In this
work, we explore and compare various strategies for constraining parameter
using our model, focusing on the matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and the
density fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$. First, we examine the impact from the
cosmological dependency of covariances (CDC). Second, we perform the analysis
with the copula likelihood, a technique which makes a weaker assumption
compared to the Gaussian likelihood. Third, direct, non-analytic parameter
estimations are applied using the full information of the distribution. Fourth,
we obtain constraints with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an
efficient, robust, and likelihood-free algorithm based on accept-reject
sampling. We find that neglecting the CDC effect enlarges parameter contours by
22%, and that the covariance-varying copula likelihood is a very good
approximation to the true likelihood. The direct techniques work well in spite
of noisier contours. Concerning ABC, the iterative process converges quickly to
a posterior distribution that is in an excellent agreement with results from
our other analyses. The time cost for ABC is reduced by two orders of
magnitude. The stochastic nature of our weak-lensing peak count model allows us
to use various techniques that approach the true underlying probability
distribution of observables, without making simplifying assumptions. Our work
can be generalized to other observables where forward simulations provide
samples of the underlying distribution.

using a training set, which is either precomputed or generated dynamically.
However, this approach is only safe if the approximations are well understood
and controlled. This paper surveys issues associated with the use of
machine-learning based emulation strategies for accelerating cosmological
parameter estimation. We describe a learn-as-you-go algorithm that is
implemented in the Cosmo++ code and (1) trains the emulator while
simultaneously estimating posterior probabilities; (2) identifies unreliable
estimates, computing the exact numerical likelihoods if necessary; and (3)
progressively learns and updates the error model as the calculation progresses.
We explicitly describe and model the emulation error and show how this can be
propagated into the posterior probabilities. We apply these techniques to the
Planck likelihood and the calculation of $\Lambda$CDM posterior probabilities.
The computation is significantly accelerated without a pre-defined training set
and uncertainties in the posterior probabilities are subdominant to statistical
fluctuations. We have obtained a speedup factor of $6.5$ for
Metropolis-Hastings and $3.5$ for nested sampling. Finally, we discuss the
general requirements for a credible error model and show how to update them
on-the-fly.

was given by Tsukiyama et.al. in 1977. As any algorithm falling within the
Reverse Search paradigm, it performs a DFS visit of a directed tree (the
RS-tree) having the objects to be listed (i.e. maximal cliques) as its nodes.
In a recursive implementation, the RS-tree corresponds to the recursion tree of
the algorithm. The time delay is given by the cost of generating the next child
of a node, and Tsukiyama showed it is $O(mn)$. In 2004, Makino and Uno
sharpened the time delay to $O(n^{\omega})$ by generating all the children of a
node in one single shot performed by computing a \emph{square} fast matrix
multiplication. In this paper, we further improve the asymptotics for the
exploration of the same RS-tree by grouping the offsprings' computation even
further. Our idea is to rely on rectangular fast matrix multiplication in order
to compute all children of $n^2$ nodes in one shot. According to the current
upper bounds on fast matrix multiplication, with this the time delay improves
from $O(n^{2.3728639})$ to $O(n^{2.093362})$.

WHFast is significantly faster and conserves energy better than all other

the Kepler-solver and ensuring numerical stability of coordinate
transformations to and from Jacobi coordinates. These refinements allow us to
remove the linear secular trend in the energy error that is present in other
implementations. For small enough timesteps we achieve Brouwer's law, i.e. the
energy error is dominated by an unbiased random walk due to floating-point
round-off errors. We implement symplectic correctors up to order eleven that
significantly reduce the energy error. We also implement a symplectic tangent
map for the variational equations. This allows us to efficiently calculate two
widely used chaos indicators the Lyapunov characteristic number (LCN) and the
Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO). WHFast is freely

descriptors for images exhibit a natural matrix structure. When visual
descriptors are represented by high-dimensional feature vectors and long binary
codes are assigned, a random projection matrix requires expensive complexities

method where feature matrices are transformed to binary codes by two smaller
random projection matrices. We base our theoretical analysis on extending
Raginsky and Lazebnik's result where random Fourier features are composed with
random binary quantizers to form locality sensitive binary codes. To this end,
we answer the following two questions: (1) whether a bilinear random projection
also yields similarity-preserving binary codes; (2) whether a bilinear random
projection yields performance gain or loss, compared to a large linear
projection. Regarding the first question, we present upper and lower bounds on
the expected Hamming distance between binary codes produced by bilinear random
projections. In regards to the second question, we analyze the upper and lower

The location of first carbon ignition, quenching location of the carbon burning

are studied as a function of the ZAMS mass, initial rotation rate, and mixing
parameters such as convective overshoot, semiconvection, thermohaline and
angular momentum transport. In general terms, we find these properties of
carbon burning in SAGB models are not a strong function of the initial rotation
profile, but are a sensitive function of the overshoot parameter. We
quasi-analytically derive an approximate ignition density, $\rho_{ign} \approx
2.1 \times 10^6$ g cm$^{-3}$, to predict the location of first carbon ignition
in models that ignite carbon off-center. We also find that overshoot moves the
ZAMS mass boundaries where off-center carbon ignition occurs at a nearly
uniform rate of $\Delta M_{\rm ZAMS}$/$\Delta f_{\rm{ov}}\approx$ 1.6
$M_{\odot}$. For zero overshoot, $f_{\rm{ov}}$=0.0, our models in the ZAMS mass
range $\approx$ 8.9 to 11 $M_{\odot}$ show off-center carbon ignition. For
canonical amounts of overshooting, $f_{\rm{ov}}$=0.016, the off-center carbon
ignition range shifts to $\approx$ 7.2 to 8.8 $M_{\odot}$. Only systems with
$f_{\rm{ov}}$ $\geq 0.01$ and ZAMS mass $\approx$ 7.2-8.0 $M_{\odot}$ show
carbon burning is quenched a significant distance from the center. These

the circle to circloids with decomposable boundary. As special cases, this
includes both decomposable cofrontiers and decomposable cobasin boundaries.
More precisely, we show that if the rotation number on an invariant circloid
$A$ of a surface homeomorphism is irrational and the boundary of $A$ is
decomposable, then the dynamics are monotonically semiconjugate to the
respective irrational rotation. This complements classical results by Barge and
Gillette on the equivalence between rational rotation numbers and the existence
of periodic orbits and yields a direct analogue to the Poincar\'e
Classification Theorem for circle homeomorphisms. Moreover, we show that the
semiconjugacy can be obtained as the composition of a monotone circle map with
a `universal factor map', only depending on the topological structure of the
circloid. This implies, in particular, that the monotone semiconjugacy is
unique up to post-composition with a rotation. If, in addition, $A$ is a
minimal set, then the semiconjugacy is almost one-to-one if and only if there
exists a biaccessible point. In this case, the dynamics on $A$ are almost
automorphic. Conversely, we use the Anosov-Katok method to build a
$C^\infty$-example where all fibres of the semiconjugacy are non-trivial.

metal-rich intermediate-age stellar population (300 Myr to 1 Gyr old, ~solar
metallicity) in addition to the dominant old population. The radial gradients
in age and metallicity of the old stellar population are consistent with those
in previous works. For the intermediate-age population, we find an increase in
age with radius and a mass fraction that increases up to 2% at 680 pc away from
the center. We exclude contamination from the M31 disk and/or halo as the main
origin for this population. Our results thus suggest that intermediate-age
stars exist beyond the central 5"" (19 pc) of M31 and contribute ~1% of the
total stellar mass in the bulge. These stars could be related to the secular
growth of the M31 bulge.

prominent low frequency QPO and its harmonic in GX 339-4. We track the
evolution of these spectra as the source makes a transition from a bright
low/hard to hard intermediate state. In the hard/intermediate states, the QPO
and time averaged spectra are similar and the harmonic is either undetected or
similar to the QPO. By contrast, in the softer states the harmonic is
dramatically softer than the QPO spectrum and the time averaged spectrum, and
the QPO spectrum is dramatically harder than the time averaged spectrum.
Clearly, the existance of these very different spectral shaped components mean
that the time-averaged spectra are complex. We use the frequency resolved
spectra to better constrain the model components, and find that the data are
consistent with a time-averaged spectrum which has an additional low
temperature, optically thick Comptonisation component. The harmonic can be
described by this additional component alone, while the QPO spectrum is similar
to that of the hard Comptonisation and its reflection. Neither QPO nor harmonic
show signs of the disc component even when it is strong in the time averaged
spectrum. While the similarity between the harmonic and QPO spectra in the
intermediate state can be produced from the angular dependence of Compton
scattering in a single region, this cannot explain the dramatic differences
seen in the soft state. Instead, we propose that the soft Compton region is
located predominantly above the disc while the hard Compton is from the hotter
inner flow. Our results therefore point to multiple possible mechanisms for
producing harmonic features in the power spectrum. The dominant mechanism in a
given observation is likely a function of both inclination angle and inner disc

Previous work has successfully demonstrated manual design of pillar sequences
to achieve desired transformations of the flow cross-section, with experimental
validation. However, such a method is not ideal for seeking out complex
sculpted shapes as the search space quickly becomes too large for efficient
manual discovery. We explore fast, automated optimization methods to solve this

These state transition matrices are constructed from experimentally validated
streamtraces. This facilitates modeling the effect of a sequence of
micropillars as nested matrix-matrix products, which have very efficient
numerical implementations. With this new forward model, arbitrary micropillar
sequences can be rapidly simulated with various inlet configurations, allowing
optimization routines quick access to a large search space. We integrate this
framework with the genetic algorithm and showcase its applicability by
designing micropillar sequences for various useful transformations. We
computationally discover micropillar sequences for complex transformations that
are substantially shorter than manually designed sequences. We also determine
sequences for novel transformations that were difficult to manually design.
Finally, we experimentally validate these computational designs by fabricating

requires accurate reconstruction of those dynamics and construction of an

involves a number of free parameters and the computation of homology for a
large number of simplices can be expensive. This paper is a study of how to
avoid a full (diffeomorphic) reconstruction and how to decrease the
computational burden. Using trajectories from the classic Lorenz system, we
reconstruct the dynamics using the method of delays, then build a parsimonious
simplicial complex---the ""witness complex""---to compute its homology.
Surprisingly, we find that the witness complex correctly resolves the homology
of the underlying invariant set from noisy samples of that set even if the
reconstruction dimension is well below the thresholds specified in the
embedding theorems for assuring topological conjugacy between the true and
reconstructed dynamics. We conjecture that this is because the requirements for
reconstructing homology, are less stringent than those in the embedding
theorems. In particular, to faithfully reconstruct the homology, a
homeomorphism is sufficient---as opposed to a diffeomorphism, as is necessary
for the full dynamics. We provide preliminary evidence that a homeomorphism, in
the form of a delay-coordinate reconstruction map, may manifest at a lower
dimension than that required to achieve an embedding.

two cognitive users establish a communication link on a commonly-available

that rendezvous can be completed within finite time and they generate
channel-hopping (CH) sequences based on the whole channel set. However, some
channels may not be available (e.g., they are being used by the licensed users)
and these existing algorithms would randomly replace the unavailable channels
in the CH sequence. This random replacement is not effective, especially when
the number of unavailable channels is large. In this paper, we design a new
rendezvous algorithm that attempts rendezvous on the available channels only
for faster rendezvous. This new algorithm, called Interleaved Sequences based
on Available Channel set (ISAC), constructs an odd sub-sequence and an even
sub-sequence and interleaves these two sub-sequences to compose a CH sequence.
We prove that ISAC provides guaranteed rendezvous (i.e., rendezvous can be
achieved within finite time). We derive the upper bound on the maximum
time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) to be O(m) (m is not greater than Q) under the
symmetric model and O(mn) (n is not greater than Q) under the asymmetric model,

investigate the intrinsic plasmon in silicene. At finite temperatures, an
undamped plasmon is generated from the interplay between the intraband and the
interband-gap transitions. The extent of the plasmon existence range in terms
of momentum and temperature, which is dependent on the size of
single-particle-excitation gap, is further tuned by applying a perpendicular
electric field. The plasmon becomes damped in the interband-excitation region.
A low damped zone is created by the field-induced spin split. The
field-dependent plasmon spectrum shows a strong tunability in plasmon intensity
and spectral bandwidth. This could make silicene a very suitable candidate for
plasmonic applications.

multi-frequency radio and X-ray data, including radio polarimetry, spanning the

a hard state, through a soft state, before returning to a hard state and
quiescence. Its radio behaviour is typical of a compact jet that becomes
quenched before discrete ejecta are launched during the late stages of X-ray
softening. The radio and X-ray fluxes, as well as the light curve morphologies,
are consistent with those observed during the 2002 outburst of this source. The
polarisation angle during the rise of the outburst infers a jet orientation in
agreement with resolved observations but also displays a gradual drift, which
we associate with observed changes in the structure of the discrete ejecta. We
also observe an unexpected 90deg rotation of the polarisation angle associated
with a second component.

Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Multiple array configurations were used,
providing a best spatial resolution of $\sim$ 0.15 arcsec, or 15 AU at
HD100546's distance of $\sim$ 100 pc. Significant structure is revealed, but
its precise form is dependent on the $u-v$ plane sampling used for the image
reconstruction. At a resolution of $\leq$ 30 AU we detected an inner gap in the
disk with a radius of $\sim$ 25 AU and a position angle approximately along the
known disk major axis. With different weighting, and an achieved resolution of
$\sim$ 15 AU, emission appears at the centre and the disk takes on the shape of
an incomplete ring, much like a horseshoe, again with a gap radius of $\sim$ 25
AU. The position angle of the disk major axis and its inclination from face-on
are determined to be $140^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}$ and $40^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}$
respectively. The $\sim$ 25 AU gap radius is confirmed by a null in the real
part of the binned visibilities at 320$\pm$10 k$\lambda$, whilst the
non-axisymmetric nature is also confirmed through significant structure in the
imaginary component. The emission mechanism at the central peak is most likely
to be free-free emission from a stellar or disk wind. Overall our data support
the picture of at least one, but probably several, giant planets orbiting

insects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A
major problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance
estimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to
distance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to
estimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control
inputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control
gain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the
distance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first
starts to exhibit self-induced oscillations, eventually leading to instability.
The proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major
attractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations are easy for the
robot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be
estimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The
stability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with
a Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final
approach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2)
estimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire
landing if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the
'edge of oscillation'.

The sender first broadcasts each packet uncoded once, then generates coded

on strict IDNC (S-IDNC), where each coded packet includes at most one missing
packet of every receiver. But we will also compare it with general IDNC
(G-IDNC), where this condition is relaxed. We characterize two fundamental
performance limits of S-IDNC: 1) the number of transmissions to complete the
broadcast, and 2) the average delay for a receiver to decode a packet. We
derive a closed-form expression for the expected minimum number of
transmissions in terms of the number of packets and receivers and the erasure
probability. We prove that it is NP-hard to minimize the decoding delay of
S-IDNC. We also derive achievable upper bounds on the above two performance
limits. We show that G-IDNC can outperform S-IDNC %in terms of the number of
transmissions without packet erasures, but not necessarily with packet
erasures. Next, we design optimal and heuristic S-IDNC transmission schemes and
coding algorithms with full/intermittent receiver feedback. We present

corpus of bug fix commits (ca.~8,296), from 10 different Java projects, and we
focus on its language statistics, evaluating the naturalness of buggy code and
the corresponding fixes. We find that code with bugs tends to be more entropic
(i.e., unnatural), becoming less so as bugs are fixed. Focusing on highly
entropic lines is similar in cost-effectiveness to some well-known static bug
finders (PMD, FindBugs) and ordering warnings from these bug finders using an
entropy measure improves the cost-effectiveness of inspecting code implicated
in warnings. This suggests that entropy may be a valid language-independent and
simple way to complement the effectiveness of PMD or FindBugs, and that
search-based bug-fixing methods may benefit from using entropy both for
fault-localization and searching for fixes.

interaction pushes the critical gravitational coupling to a larger value, at
which the size of a polymer becomes comparable to its Schwarzschild radius, and
as a result the size of the corresponding black hole increases considerably. We
show phase diagrams in various dimensions that clarify how the size changes as
the strengths of repulsive and gravitational forces vary.

combinatorial structure that we introduce in this paper. A suitably normalized
version of the symmetry defects applies to compact $3$-manifolds endowed with
$PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$-characters, beyond the case of cusped manifolds. Given a
manifold $M$ with non empty boundary, we provide a partial ""holographic""
description of the non-ambiguous structures in terms of the intrinsic geometric
topology of $\partial M$. Special instances of non ambiguous structures can be
defined by means of taut triangulations, and the symmetry defects have a
particularly nice behaviour on such ""taut structures"". Natural examples of taut
structures are carried by any mapping torus with punctured fibre of negative
Euler characteristic, or by sutured manifold hierarchies. For a cusped
hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ which fibres over $S^1$, we address the question of
determining whether the fibrations over a same fibered face of the Thurston
ball define the same taut structure. We describe a few examples in detail. In
particular, they show that the symmetry defects or the reduced QHI can
distinguish taut structures associated to different fibrations of $M$. To
support the guess that all this is an instance of a general behaviour of state

as the acceleration mechanism for galactic cosmic rays. While self-consistent
hybrid simulations have shown how power-law spectra are produced, detailed
information on the interplay of diffusive particle motion and the turbulent
electromagnetic fields responsible for repeated shock crossings are still
elusive. Aims. The framework of test-particle theory is applied to investigate
the effect of diffusive shock acceleration by inspecting the obtained
cosmic-ray energy spectra. The resulting energy spectra can be obtained this
way from the particle motion and, depending on the prescribed turbulence model,
the influence of stochastic acceleration through plasma waves can be studied.
Methods. A numerical Monte-Carlo simulation code is extended to include
collisionless shock waves. This allows one to trace the trajectories of test
particle while they are being accelerated. In addition, the diffusion
coefficients can be obtained directly from the particle motion, which allows
for a detailed understanding of the acceleration process. Results. The classic
result of an energy spectrum with $E^{-2}$ is only reproduced for parallel
shocks, while, for all other cases, the energy spectral index is reduced
depending on the shock obliqueness. Qualitatively, this can be explained in
terms of the diffusion coefficients in the directions that are parallel and
perpendicular to the shock front.

MegaCam camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT). We performed a
robust selection of field and cluster stars by applying a new method based on
the 3D (r',u'-g',g'-r') Color-Color-Magnitude-Diagram. The comparison between
the Color-Magnitude-Diagram of the candidate cluster stars and a new set of
isochrones, at the locus of the Main Sequence Turn Off (MSTO), suggests an
absolute age of 12+/-2 Gyr. The absolute age was also estimated using the
difference in magnitude between the MSTO and the so-called main sequence knee,
a well defined bending occurring in the lower main sequence. This feature was
originally detected in the near-infrared (NIR) bands and explained as a
consequence of an opacity mechanism (collisionally induced absorption of
molecular hydrogen) in the atmosphere of cool low-mass stars (Bono et al.
2010). The same feature was also detected in the r',u'-g' and in the r',g'-r'
CMD, thus supporting previous theoretical predictions by Borysow et al. (1997).
The key advantage in using the Delta^(Knee)_(TO) as an age diagnostic is that
it is independent of uncertainties affecting the distance, the reddening and
the photometric zero-point. We found an absolute age of 12+/-1 Gyr that agrees,
within the errors, with similar age estimates, but the uncertainty is on
average a factor of two smaller. We also found that the Delta^(Knee)_(TO) is
more sensitive to the metallicity than the MSTO, but the dependence becomes
vanishing using the difference in color between the MSK and the MSTO.

late type stars in the galactic bulges and also early type massive stars in the
nuclear stellar clusters which are additionally surrounded by quasi-spherical
several kpc scale halos containing from a few hundred up to several thousand
globular clusters (GCs). It is expected that significant numbers of red giant
stars, massive stars and also GCs can move through the jet expelled from the
central engine of active galaxy. We consider collisions of stars from the
galactic bulge, nuclear cluster and globular clusters with the jet plasma. As a
result of such collisions, multiple shocks are expected to appear in the jet
around these compact objects. Therefore, the plasma in the kpc scale jet can be
significantly disturbed. We show that particles can be accelerated on these
shocks up to the multi-TeV energies. TeV leptons emit synchrotron radiation,
extending up to the X-ray energies, and also comptonize radiation produced in a
stellar cluster and also the Microwave Background Radiation to TeV $\gamma$-ray
energies. We show that such non-thermal radiation is likely to be detectable
from the intermediate scale jets of the nearby active galaxies for reasonable
number of stars and GCs immersed within the jet. As an example, we calculate
the expected non-thermal emission in the X-ray and gamma-ray energies from the
nearby radio galaxy Cen A from which a steady gamma-ray emission with the
complex spectrum has been recently reported by the Fermi and the HESS
Observatories.

principal quantum numbers. Here, we report on the observation of effects linked
to symmetry breaking in helium within the optical cycle of the utilized strong
visible laser fields for states with principal quantum number n=2. These
findings were enabled by temporally resolving the dynamics better than the
sub-optical cycle of the applied laser field, utilizing the method of
attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS). We identify the
spectroscopic fingerprint of instantaneous polarization and breaking of the

systems are of both fundamental and practical interest. For example, in
considering the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-\beta W} \rangle=e^{-\beta
\Delta F}$, a change in the fluctuations of $e^{-\beta W}$ may impact on how
fast the statistical average of $e^{-\beta W}$ converges towards the
theoretical value $e^{-\beta \Delta F}$, where $W$ is the work, $\beta$ is the
inverse temperature, and $\Delta F$ is free energy difference between two
equilibrium states. Motivated by our previous study aiming at the suppression
of work fluctuations, here we obtain a principle of minimal work fluctuations.
In brief, adiabatic processes as treated in quantum and classical adiabatic
theorems yield the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\beta W}$. In the quantum
domain, if a system initially prepared at thermal equilibrium is subject to a
work protocol but isolated from a bath during the time evolution, then a
quantum adiabatic process without energy level crossing (or an assisted
adiabatic process reaching the same final states as in a conventional adiabatic
process) yields the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\beta W}$, where $W$ is the
quantum work defined by two energy measurements in the beginning and at the end
of the process. In the classical domain where the classical work protocol is
realizable by an adiabatic process, then the classical adiabatic process also
yields the minimal fluctuations in $e^{-\beta W}$. Numerical experiments based
on a Landau-Zener process confirm our theory in the quantum domain, and our
theory in the classical domain explains our previous numerical findings
regarding the suppression of classical work fluctuations [G.~Y.~Xiao and
J.~B.~Gong, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 90}, 052132 (2014)].

For example, free
samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or

One way to formalize marketers' objective is through influence maximization (or
IM), whose goal is to find the best seed nodes to activate under a fixed
budget, so that the number of people who get influenced in the end is
maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that a user
influences another one. However, this probability information may be
unavailable or incomplete. In this paper, we study IM in the absence of
complete information on influence probability. We call this problem Online
Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learn influence probabilities at the same
time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM, we propose a multiple-trial
approach, where (1) some seed nodes are selected based on existing influence
information; (2) an influence campaign is started with these seed nodes; and
(3) users' feedback is used to update influence information. We adopt the
Explore-Exploit strategy, which can select seed nodes using either the current
influence probability estimation (exploit), or the confidence bound on the
estimation (explore). Any existing IM algorithm can be used in this framework.
We also develop an incremental algorithm that can significantly reduce the
overhead of handling users' feedback information. Our experiments show that our
solution is more effective than traditional IM methods on the partial
information.

functions (LF) in nearby clusters. This sample is complete down to Mv=-15.15,
and it is homogeneous, thus allowing the study of an unbiased sample of
clusters with different characteristics. We constructed the photometric LF for
72 out of the original 76 WINGS clusters, excluding only those without a
velocity dispersion estimate. For each cluster we obtained the LF for galaxies
in a region of radius=0.5 x r200, and fitted them with single and double
Schechter's functions. We also derive the composite LF for the entire sample,
and those pertaining to different morphological classes. Finally we derive the
spectroscopic cumulative LF for 2009 galaxies that are cluster members. The
double Schechter fit parameters are neither correlated with the cluster
velocity dispersion, nor with the X-ray luminosity. Our median values of the
Schechter's fit slope are, on average, in agreement with measurements of nearby
clusters, but are less steep that those derived from large surveys, such as the
SDSS. Early--type galaxies outnumber late-types at all magnitudes, but both
early and late types contribute equally to the faint end of the LF. Finally,
the spectroscopic LF is in excellent agreement with the ones derived for A2199,
A85 and Virgo, and with the photometric one at the bright magnitudes (where
both are available). There is a large spread in the LF of different clusters.
However, this spread is not caused by correlation of the LF shape with cluster
characteristics such as X--ray luminosity or velocity dispersions. The faint
end is flatter than what previously derived (alpha_f=-1.7) at odds with what
predicted from numerical simulations.

observe emissions from various atomic and molecular species from within the

Following orbit insertion in August 2014, Alice made observations of the inner
coma above the limbs of the nucleus of the comet from cometocentric distances
varying between 10 and 80 km. Depending on the position and orientation of the
slit relative to the nucleus, emissions of atomic hydrogen and oxygen were
initially detected. These emissions are spatially localized close to the
nucleus and spatially variable with a strong enhancement above the comet's neck
at northern latitudes. Weaker emission from atomic carbon and CO were
subsequently detected. Results. Analysis of the relative line intensities
suggests photoelectron impact dissociation of H2O vapor as the source of the
observed H I and O I emissions. The electrons are produced by photoionization
of H2O. The observed C I emissions are also attributed to electron impact
dissociation, of CO2, and their relative brightness to H I reflects the
variation of CO2 to H2O column abundance in the coma.

internal structure of core helium burning (CHeB) stars. The stellar structure
during CHeB is very uncertain because the growth of the convective core, and/or
the development of a semiconvection zone, is critically dependent on the
treatment of convective boundaries. In this study we calculate a suite of
stellar structure models and their non-radial pulsations to investigate why the
predicted asymptotic g-mode $\ell = 1$ period spacing $\Delta\Pi_1$ is
systematically lower than is inferred from Kepler field stars. We find that
only models with large convective cores, such as those calculated with our
newly proposed ""maximal-overshoot"" scheme, can match the average $\Delta\Pi_1$
reported. However, we also find another possible solution that is related to
the method used to determine $\Delta\Pi_1$: mode trapping can raise the
observationally inferred $\Delta\Pi_1$ well above its true value. Even after
accounting for these two proposed resolutions to the discrepancy in average
$\Delta\Pi_1$, models still predict more CHeB stars with low $\Delta\Pi_1$ ($ <
270$ s) than are observed. We establish two possible remedies for this: i)
there may be a difficulty in determining $\Delta\Pi_1$ for early CHeB stars
(when $\Delta\Pi_1$ is lowest) because of the effect that the sharp composition
profile at the hydrogen burning shell has on the pulsations, or ii) the mass of
the helium core at the flash is higher than predicted. Our conclusions
highlight the need for the reporting of selection effects in asteroseismic
population studies in order to safely use this information to constrain stellar
evolution theory.

primary source of Galactic electrons and positrons, contributing to the
observed enhancement in positron flux above ~10 GeV. Fermi has also uncovered
many new millisecond pulsars, impacting Galactic stellar population models. We
investigate the contribution of Galactic millisecond pulsars to the flux of
terrestrial cosmic-ray electrons and positrons. Our population synthesis code
predicts the source properties of present-day millisecond pulsars. We simulate
their pair spectra invoking an offset-dipole magnetic field. We also consider
positrons and electrons that have been further accelerated to energies of
several TeV by strong intrabinary shocks in black widow and redback systems.
Since millisecond pulsars are not surrounded by pulsar wind nebulae or
supernova shells, we assume that the pairs freely escape and undergo losses
only in the intergalactic medium. We compute the transported pair spectra at
Earth, following their diffusion and energy loss through the Galaxy. The
predicted particle flux increases for non-zero offsets of the magnetic polar
caps. Pair cascades from the magnetospheres of millisecond pulsars are only
modest contributors around a few tens of GeV to the lepton fluxes measured by
AMS-02, PAMELA, and Fermi, after which this component cuts off. The
contribution by black widows and redbacks may, however, reach levels of a few
tens of percent at tens of TeV, depending on model parameters.

such as S-estimation have been proposed. These estimators flag any observation
with a large residual as an outlier and downweight it in the further procedure.
However, a large residual may be caused by an outlier in only one single
predictor variable, and downweighting the complete observation results in a
loss of information.
  Therefore, we propose the shooting S-estimator, a regression estimator that
is especially designed for situations where a large number of observations
suffer from contamination in a small number of predictor variables. The
shooting S-estimator combines the ideas of the coordinate descent algorithm
with simple S-regression, which makes it robust against componentwise
contamination, at the cost of failing the regression equivariance property.

real time routing, wireless network simulation, and etc. There are four basic
wireless operations that are required to be modeled, i.e., unicast, anycast,
broadcast, and multicast. As observed in many recent works, the temporal and
spatial distribution of packet receptions can have significant impact on
wireless performance involving multiple links (anycast/broadcast/multicast).
However, existing performance models and simulations overlook these two
wireless behaviors, leading to biased performance estimation and simulation
results. In this paper, we first explicitly identify the necessary
""3-Dimension"" information for wireless performance modeling, i.e., packet
reception rate (PRR), PRR spatial distribution, and temporal distribution. We
then propose a comprehensive modeling approach considering 3-Dimension Wireless
information (called 3DW model). Further, we demonstrate the generality and wide
applications of 3DW model by two case studies: 3DWbased network simulation and
3DW-based real time routing protocol. Extensive simulation and testbed
experiments have been conducted. The results show that 3DW model achieves much
more accurate performance estimation for both anycast and broadcast/multicast.
3DW-based simulation can effectively reserve the end-to-end performance metric
of the input empirical traces. 3DW-based routing can select more efficient
senders, achieving better transmission efficiency.

used to represent the semantic distance between concepts in the edge-based
semantic similarity measures. In the past, the edge counting is considered to
be the default method for the path computation, which is simple, intuitive and
has low computational complexity. However, a large lexical taxonomy of such as
WordNet has the irregular densities of links between concepts due to its broad
domain but. The edge counting-based path computation is powerless for this
non-uniformity problem. In this paper, we advocate that the path computation is
able to be separated from the edge-based similarity measures and form various
general computing models. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of
non-uniformity of concept density in a large taxonomic ontology, we propose a
new path computing model based on the compensation of local area density of
concepts, which is equal to the number of direct hyponyms of the subsumers of
concepts in their shortest path. This path model considers the local area
density of concepts as an extension of the edge-based path and converts the
local area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based
path with an adjustable parameter, which idea has been proven to be consistent
with the information theory. This model is a general path computing model and
can be applied in various edge-based similarity algorithms. The experiment
results show that the proposed path model improves the average correlation
between edge-based measures with human judgments on Miller and Charles
benchmark from less than 0.8 to more than 0.85, and has a big advantage in
efficiency than information content (IC) computation in a dynamic ontology,

with entropy production. Indeed, in his seminal work on cyclic cosmology,
Tolman introduced a viscous fluid in order to make successive
expansion/contraction cycles larger than previous ones, thereby generating an
arrow of time. However, as we demonstrate in this letter, the production of
entropy is not the only means by which a cosmological arrow of time may emerge.
Remarkably, systems which are dissipationless may nevertheless demonstrate a
preferred direction of time provided they possess attractors. An example of a
system with well defined attractors is scalar-field driven cosmology. In this
case, for a wide class of potentials (especially those responsible for
inflation), the attractor equation of state during expansion can have the form
$p \simeq -\rho$, and during contraction $p \simeq \rho$. If the resulting
cosmology is cyclic, then the presence of cosmological hysteresis, $\oint p~dV
\neq 0$ during successive cycles, causes an arrow of time to emerge in a system
which is formally dissipationless. An important analogy is drawn between the
arrow of time in cyclic cosmology and an arrow of time in an $N$-body system of
gravitationally interacting particles. We find that, like the $N$-body system,

regions where the magnetic fields are strongly non-potential. It has been shown
that reconnection in helical magnetic coronal loops results in plasma heating

lower coronal and chromospheric sections of the loops. This scenario can be an
alternative to the standard flare model, where particles are accelerated only
in a small volume located in the upper corona. We use a combination of MHD
simulations and test-particle methods, which describe the development of kink
instability and magnetic reconnection in twisted coronal loops using resistive
compressible MHD, and incorporate atmospheric stratification and large-scale
loop curvature. The resulting distributions of hot plasma let us estimate
thermal X-ray emission intensities. The electric and magnetic fields obtained
are used to calculate electron trajectories using the guiding-centre

distributions let us deduce synthetic HXR bremsstrahlung intensities. Our
simulations emphasise that the geometry of the emission patterns produced by
hot plasma in flaring twisted coronal loops can differ from the actual geometry
of the underlying magnetic fields. The twist angles revealed by the emission
threads (SXR) are consistently lower than the field-line twist present at the
onset of the kink-instability. HXR emission due to the interaction of energetic
electrons with the stratified background are concentrated at the loop
foot-points in these simulations, even though the electrons are accelerated
everywhere within the coronal volume of the loop. The maximum of HXR emission
consistently precedes that of SXR emission, with the HXR light-curve being
approximately proportional to the temporal derivative of the SXR light-curve.

energy from photons of solar origin for biological use. Subsurface regions are
isolated from the photosphere, and consequently are incapable of utilizing this
energy. This opens up the opportunity for life to evolve alternate mechanisms
for harvesting available energy. Bacterium Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator,
found 2.8 km deep in a South African mine, harvests energy from radiolysis,
induced by particles emitted from radioactive U, Th and K present in
surrounding rock. Another radiation source in the subsurface environments is
secondary particles generated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Using Monte Carlo
simulations, it is shown that it is a steady source of energy comparable to
that produced by radioactive substances, and the possibility of a slow
metabolizing life flourishing on it cannot be ruled out. Two mechanisms are
proposed through which GCR-induced secondary particles can be utilized for
biological use in subsurface environments: (1) GCRs injecting energy in the
environment through particle-induced radiolysis, and (2) organic synthesis from
GCR secondaries interacting with the medium. Laboratory experiments to test
these hypotheses are also proposed. Implications of these mechanisms on finding
life in the Solar System and elsewhere in the Universe are discussed.

that communities indeed coexist and overlap at the different layers of such

electrons or muons are selected, with two of them required to be consistent
with originating from a $Z$ boson decay. No significant excess above Standard
Model background predictions is observed, and 95% confidence level limits on
the production cross section of high-mass trilepton resonances are derived. The
results are interpreted in the context of vector-like lepton and type-III
seesaw models. For the vector-like lepton model, most heavy lepton mass values
in the range 114-176 GeV are excluded. For the type-III seesaw model, most mass
values in the range 100-468 GeV are excluded.

monolayer Fermi velocity $v_F$ is smaller. We show that with current

that collapsing matter crossing the event horizon continues to fall towards the
singularity of the Schwarzschild interior, this region does not in fact contain
the matter originally responsible for the collapse. Rather, the latter occupies
a distinct internal spacetime region with its own independent evolution. The
existence of this additional component of the simplest black hole has a number
of profound implications - Schwarzschild black holes are stable with constant
mass; they each contain a self-contained mini-universe within their event
horizons; and they live within a spacetime that is inherently double-sheeted.
