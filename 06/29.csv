We show that simply by virtue of being the generator of time translations, the
Hamiltonian must always be $PT$ symmetric, regardless of whether or not it
might be Hermitian. We show that the reality of the Euclidean time path
integral is a necessary and sufficient condition for $PT$ symmetry of a quantum
field theory, with Hermiticity only being a sufficient condition. We show that
in order to construct the correct classical action needed for a path integral
quantization one must impose $PT$ symmetry on each classical path, a
requirement that has no counterpart in any Hermiticity condition since
Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian is only definable after the quantization has been
performed and the quantum Hilbert space has been constructed. With the
spacetime metric being $PT$ even we show that a covariant action must always be
$PT$ symmetric. Unlike Hermiticity, $PT$ symmetry does not need to be
postulated as it is derivable from Poincare invariance. Hermiticity is just a
particular realization of $PT$ symmetry, one in which the eigenspectrum is real

statistics can be studied in terms of spectral properties of a deformed Markov
transition matrix. We observe two different types of phase transition in such
systems: (i) rare events which are singled out for sufficiently large values of
the deformation parameter may correspond to {\em localized\/} modes of the
deformed transition matrix, (ii) ""mode-switching transitions"" may occur as the
deformation parameter is varied. Details depend on the nature of the observable

average degree of the nodes visited along a random walk trajectory in
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. Large deviations rate functions and localization
properties are studied numerically. For observables of the type considered

for L\'evy processes based on a non parametric estimation procedure. The
calibration problem is of considerable interest in mathematical finance and
beyond. Calibration of L\'evy processes is particularly challenging as the jump
distribution is given by an arbitrary L\'evy measure, which form a infinite
dimensional space. In this work, we follow an approach which is related to the
maximum likelihood theory of sieves.
  The sampling of the L\'evy process is modelled as independent observations of
the stochastic process at some terminal time $T$. We use a generic spline
discretization of the L\'evy jump measure and select an adequate size of the
spline basis using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
  The numerical solution of the L\'evy calibration problem requires efficient
optimization of the log likelihood functional in high dimensional parameter
spaces. We provide this by the optimal control of Kolmogorov's forward equation
for the probability density function (Fokker-Planck equation). The first order
optimality conditions are derived based on the Lagrange multiplier technique in
a functional space. The resulting Partial Integral-Differential Equations
(PIDE) are discretized, numerically solved and controlled using scheme a
composed of Chang-Cooper, BDF2 and direct quadrature methods. For the numerical
solver of the Kolmogorov's forward equation we prove conditions for
non-negativity and stability in the $L^1$ norm of the discrete solution. To set
boundary conditions, we argue that any L\'evy process on the real line can be
projected to a torus, where it again is a L\'evy process. If the torus is
sufficiently large, the loss of information is negligible.

of traditional symplectic integrators yet is applicable to general
nonconservative systems. We utilize a fixed time-step variational integrator
formalism applied to the principle of stationary nonconservative action
developed in Galley, 2013; Galley, Tsang & Stein, 2014. As a result, the
generalized momenta and energy (Noether current) evolutions are well-tracked.
We discuss several example systems, including damped harmonic oscillators,
Poynting-Robertson drag, and gravitational radiation reaction, by utilizing our
new publicly available code to demonstrate the slimplectic integrator
algorithm.
  Slimplectic integrators are well-suited for integrations of systems where
nonconservative effects play an important role in the long-term dynamical
evolution. As such they are particularly appropriate for cosmological or
celestial N-body dynamics problems where nonconservative interactions, e.g. gas
interactions or dissipative tides, can play an important role.

monolayer of interacting spheres, we find three contact resonances, whose
frequencies are given by simple closed-form expressions. For a monolayer of
isolated spheres, only two resonances are present. The contact resonances
couple to surface acoustic waves in the substrate, leading to mode
hybridization and ""avoided crossing"" phenomena. We present dispersion curves
for a monolayer of silica microspheres on a silica substrate, assuming
adhesive, Hertzian interactions, and compare calculations using an effective
medium approximation to a discrete model of a monolayer on a rigid substrate.
While the effective medium model does not account for discrete lattice effects
at short wavelengths, we find that it is well suited for describing the
interaction between the monolayer and substrate in the long wavelength limit.
We suggest that a complete picture of the dynamics of a discrete monolayer
adhered to an elastic substrate can be found using a combination of the results
presented for the discrete and effective medium descriptions. This model is
potentially scalable for use with both micro- and macroscale systems, and
offers the prospect of experimentally extracting contact stiffnesses from

classical level the discontinuities of the isolated dodecahedron are
renormalized by the interdodecahedral coupling, while new ones show up, with
the maximum number of ground state discontinuities being six for a specific

spin-aligned, SXS and Llama data. The dynamics of the EOB model presented here
involves only two free functional parameters, one ($a_6^c(\nu)$) entering the
non spinning sector, as a 5PN effective correction to the interaction
potential, and one ($c_3(\tilde{a}_1,\tilde{a}_2,\nu))$ in the spinning sector,
as an effective next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order correction to the
spin-orbit coupling. These parameters are determined (together with a third
functional parameter $\Delta t_{\rm NQC}(\chi)$ entering the waveform) by
comparing the EOB phasing with the SXS phasing, the consistency of the
energetics being checked afterwards. The quality of the analytical model for
gravitational wave data analysis purposes is assessed by computing the EOB/NR
faithfulness. Over the NR data sample and when varying the total mass between

2) to provide an accessible resource for researchers interested in a security
analysis of quantum cryptographic protocols that takes into account finite
resource effects. For this purpose we collect and clarify several arguments

allowing us to be mathematically precise throughout the security analysis. We
start from an operational definition of what it means for a quantum key
distribution protocol to be secure and derive simple conditions that serve as
sufficient condition for secrecy and correctness. We then derive and eventually
discuss tradeoff relations between the block length of the classical
computation, the noise tolerance, the secret key length and the security
parameters for our protocols. Our results significantly improve upon previously

the LHC with a mass of 125 GeV is the SM Higgs boson or it belongs to models of
new physics with an extended Higgs sector, as the MSSM or 2HDM. The ratio of
branching fractions $R$ = BR($H \to b \bar b$)/BR($H \to \tau^+ \tau^-$) of
Higgs boson decays is a powerful tool in order to distinguish the MSSM Higgs
sector from the SM or non-supersymmetric 2HDM. This ratio receives large
renormalization-scheme independent radiative corrections in supersymmetric
models at large $\tan\beta$, which are insensitive to the SUSY mass scale and
absent in the SM or 2HDM. Making use of the current LHC data and the upcoming
new results on Higgs couplings to be reported by ATLAS and CMS collaborations

systems subject to (possibly) unbounded stochastic disturbances, hard
constraints on the manipulated variables, and joint chance constraints on the
states. A tractable convex second-order cone program (SOCP) is derived for
calculating the receding-horizon control law at each time step. Feedback is
incorporated during prediction by parametrizing the control law as an affine
function of the disturbances. Hard input constraints are guaranteed by
saturating the disturbances that appear in the control law parametrization. The
joint state chance constraints are conservatively approximated as a collection
of individual chance constraints that are subsequently relaxed via the
Cantelli-Chebyshev inequality. Feasibility of the SOCP is guaranteed by
softening the approximated chance constraints using the exact penalty function
method. Closed-loop stability in a stochastic sense is established by
establishing that the states satisfy a geometric drift condition outside of a
compact set such that their variance is bounded at all times. The SMPC approach
is demonstrated using a continuous acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation
process, which is used for production of high-value-added drop-in biofuels.

(SEASD), a novel computational method for dynamic simulations of polydisperse
colloidal suspensions with full hydrodynamic interactions. SEASD is based on
the framework of Stokesian Dynamics (SD) with extension to compressible
solvents, and uses the Spectral Ewald (SE) method [Lindbo & Tornberg, J.
Comput. Phys. 229 (2010) 8994] for the wave-space mobility computation. To meet
the performance requirement of dynamic simulations, we use Graphic Processing
Units (GPU) to evaluate the suspension mobility, and achieve an order of
magnitude speedup compared to a CPU implementation. For further speedup, we
develop a novel far-field block-diagonal preconditioner to reduce the far-field
evaluations in the iterative solver, and SEASD-nf, a polydisperse extension of
the mean-field Brownian approximation of Banchio & Brady [J. Chem. Phys. 118
(2003) 10323]. We extensively discuss implementation and parameter selection
strategies in SEASD, and demonstrate the spectral accuracy in the mobility
evaluation and the overall $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation scaling. We
present three computational examples to further validate SEASD and SEASD-nf in
monodisperse and bidisperse suspensions: the short-time transport properties,
the equilibrium osmotic pressure and viscoelastic moduli, and the steady shear
Brownian rheology. Our validation results show that the agreement between SEASD
and SEASD-nf is satisfactory over a wide range of parameters, and also provide
significant insight into the dynamics of polydisperse colloidal suspensions.

powerful and efficient tool that offers both close-up views and wide area

while the close-up view allows individuals to be identified from
high-resolution images of their faces. A central component of a PTZ tracking
system is a scheduling algorithm that determines which target to zoom in on.
  In this paper we study this scheduling problem from a theoretical
perspective, where the high resolution images are also used for tracklet
matching. We propose a novel data structure, the Multi-Strand Tracking Graph
(MSG), which represents the set of tracklets computed by a tracker and the
possible associations between them. The MSG allows efficient scheduling as well
as resolving -- directly or by elimination -- matching ambiguities between
tracklets. The main feature of the MSG is the auxiliary data saved in each

this paper, in order to carry out one-on-one comparisons between $\Lambda$CDM

includes computer modeling of a shock in the presence of pickup ions (PUIs).
here, we present two-dimensional (2-D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of

complete plasma and magnetic field data set from V2 gives us the opportunity to
do a full comparison between the experimental data and PIC simulation results.
Our results show that: (1) The nonstationarity of the shock front is mainly
caused by the ripples along the shock front and these ripples from even if the
percentage of PUIs is high. (2) PUIs play a key role in the energy dissipation
of the TS, and most of the incident ion dynamic energy is transferred to the
thermal energy of PUIs instead of solar wind ions (SWIs). (3) The simulated
composite heliosheath ion velocity distribution function is a superposition of
a cold core formed by transmitted SWIs, the shoulders contributed by the hot
reflected SWIs and directly transmitted PUIs, and the wings of the distribution
dominated by the very hot reflected PUIs. (4) The V2 Faraday cups observed the
cool core of the distribution, so they saw only a tip of the iceberg. For the
evolution of the cool core distribution function across the TS, the computed

different survey strategies. For asteroids with $D \leq 3$~km, we found a
significant number drop at $f = 6$ rev/day. The YORP effect timescale for

reach their spin-rate limit and results in break-up. The K-S test suggests a
possible difference in the spin-rate distributions of C- and S-type asteroids.
We also find that C-type asteroids have a smaller spin-rate limit than the
S-type, which agrees with the general sense that the C-type has lower bulk

sparse representation and single channel processing is not computationally
efficient in compressed sensing of multi-channel EEG signals. Methods: An
optimization model with L0 norm and Schatten-0 norm is proposed to enforce
cosparsity and low rank structures in the reconstructed multi-channel EEG
signals. Both convex relaxation and global consensus optimization with
alternating direction method of multipliers are used to compute the
optimization model. Results: The performance of multi-channel EEG signal
reconstruction is improved in term of both accuracy and computational
complexity. Conclusion: The proposed method is a better candidate than previous
sparse signal recovery methods for compressed sensing of EEG signals.
Significance: The proposed method enables successful compressed sensing of EEG
signals even when the signals have no good sparse representation. Using
compressed sensing would much reduce the power consumption of wireless EEG
system.

elements. However, lateral splash of the round tubes under impact loadings
reduces the energy absorption efficiency and may cause secondary damages.
Therefore, it is necessary to assemble and fasten round tubes together by
boundary constraints and/or fasteners between tubes, which increases the time
and labor cost and affects the mechanical performance of round tubes. In an
effort to break through this limitation, a novel self-locked energy-absorbing
system has been proposed in this paper. The proposed system is made up of
thin-walled tubes with dumbbell-shaped cross section, which are specially
designed to interlock with each other and thus provide lateral constraint under
impact loadings. Both finite element simulations and impact experiment
demonstrated that without boundary constraints or fasteners between tubes, the
proposed self-locked energy-absorbing system can still effectively attenuate
impact loads while the round tube systems fail to carry load due to the lateral
splashing of tubes. Furthermore, the optimal geometric design for a single
dumbbell-shaped tube and the optimal stacking arrangement for the system are
discussed, and a general guideline on the structural design of the proposed
self-locked energy absorbing system is provided.

reduction techniques are developed using a Generalized Multiscale Finite
Element Method. In these approaches, multiscale basis functions are constructed
using local snapshot spaces, where a snapshot space is a large space that
represents the solution behavior in a coarse block. In a number of applications
(e.g., those discussed in the paper), one may have a sparsity in the snapshot
space for an appropriate choice of a snapshot space. More precisely, the
solution may only involve a portion of the snapshot space. In this case, one
can use sparsity techniques to identify multiscale basis functions. In this
paper, we consider two such sparse local multiscale model reduction approaches.
  In the first approach (which is used for parameter-dependent multiscale
PDEs), we use local minimization techniques, such as sparse POD, to identify
multiscale basis functions, which are sparse in the snapshot space. These
minimization techniques use $l_1$ minimization to find local multiscale basis
functions, which are further used for finding the solution. In the second
approach (which is used for the Helmholtz equation), we directly apply $l_1$
minimization techniques to solve the underlying PDEs. This approach is more
expensive as it involves a large snapshot space; however, in this example, we
can not identify a local minimization principle, such as local generalized SVD.

We focus on study of links between gene expression data and phenotype data
through integrative analysis. We propose three approaches.
  1) The inherent complexity of phenotypes makes high-throughput phenotype
profiling a very difficult and laborious process. We propose a method of
automated multi-dimensional profiling which uses gene expression similarity.
Large-scale analysis show that our method can provide robust profiling that
reveals different phenotypic aspects of samples. This profiling technique is
also capable of interpolation and extrapolation beyond the phenotype
information given in training data. It can be used in many applications,
including facilitating experimental design and detecting confounding factors.
  2) Phenotype association analysis problems are complicated by small sample
size and high dimensionality. Consequently, phenotype-associated gene subsets
obtained from training data are very sensitive to selection of training
samples, and the constructed sample phenotype classifiers tend to have poor
generalization properties. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a novel
approach that generates sequences of increasingly discriminative gene cluster
combinations. Our experiments on both simulated and real datasets show robust
and accurate classification performance.
  3) Many complex phenotypes, such as cancer, are the product of not only gene
expression, but also gene interaction. We propose an integrative approach to
find gene network modules that activate under different phenotype conditions.
Using our method, we discovered cancer subtype-specific network modules, as
well as the ways in which these modules coordinate. In particular, we detected
a breast-cancer specific tumor suppressor network module with a hub gene,
PDGFRL, which may play an important role in this module.

of information on the basis of Bayesian networks. This framework can describe a
broad class of nonequilibrium dynamics of multiple interacting systems with
complex information exchanges. For such situations, we discuss a generalization
of the second law of thermodynamics including information contents. The key
concept here is an informational quantity called the transfer entropy, which
describes the directional information transfer in stochastic dynamics. The
generalized second law gives the fundamental lower bound of the entropy
production in nonequilibrium dynamics, and sheds modern light on the paradox of
""Maxwell's demon"" that performs measurements and feedback control at the level

approach to derive mean-field PDEs from a lattice-based model. We start with
the microscopic equations, which state the probability to find a particle at a

the probability densities and by passing to an appropriate limit as the time
steps and the distances between lattice sites tend to zero. We present an
implementation in a computer algebra system that performs this transition for a
general class of models. In order to rewrite the mean-field PDEs in a
conservative formulation, we adapt and implement symbolic integration methods
that can handle unspecified functions in several variables. To illustrate our
approach, we consider an application in crowd motion analysis where the
dynamics of bidirectional flows are studied. However, the presented approach
can be applied to various transportation processes of multiple species with
variable size in any dimension, for example, to confirm several proposed
mean-field models for cell motility.

dependence structure between variables, which is represented as a graph.
However, the dependence between variables may render inference tasks
intractable. In this paper we review techniques exploiting the graph structure
for exact inference, borrowed from optimisation and computer science. They are
built on the principle of variable elimination whose complexity is dictated in
an intricate way by the order in which variables are eliminated. The so-called
treewidth of the graph characterises this algorithmic complexity: low-treewidth
graphs can be processed efficiently. The first message that we illustrate is
therefore the idea that for inference in graphical model, the number of
variables is not the limiting factor, and it is worth checking for the
treewidth before turning to approximate methods. We show how algorithms
providing an upper bound of the treewidth can be exploited to derive a 'good'
elimination order enabling to perform exact inference. The second message is
that when the treewidth is too large, algorithms for approximate inference
linked to the principle of variable elimination, such as loopy belief
propagation and variational approaches, can lead to accurate results while
being much less time consuming than Monte-Carlo approaches. We illustrate the
techniques reviewed in this article on benchmarks of inference problems in
genetic linkage analysis and computer vision, as well as on hidden variables

derive the aggregate size that can be released by the gas pressure from the

and different volatile ices. To derive the ejected aggregate sizes, we
developed a model based on the assumption that the entire heat absorbed by the
surface is consumed by the sublimation process of one volatile species. The
calculations were performed for the three most prominent volatile materials in
comets, namely, H_20 ice, CO_2 ice, and CO ice. We find that the size range of
the dust aggregates able to escape from the nucleus into space widens when the
comet approaches the Sun and narrows with increasing heliocentric distance,
because the tensile strength of the aggregates decreases with increasing
aggregate size. The activity of CO ice in comparison to H_20 ice is capable to
detach aggregates smaller by approximately one order of magnitude from the
surface. As a result of the higher sublimation rate of CO ice, larger
aggregates are additionally able to escape from the gravity field of the
nucleus. Our model can explain the large grains (ranging from 2 cm to 1 m in
radius) in the inner coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko that have been
observed by the OSIRIS camera at heliocentric distances between 3.4 AU and 3.7
AU. Furthermore, the model predicts the release of decimeter-sized aggregates
(trail particles) close to the heliocentric distance at which the gas-driven
dust activity vanishes. However, the gas-driven dust activity cannot explain
the presence of particles smaller than ~1 mm in the coma because the high
tensile strength required to detach these particles from the surface cannot be
provided by evaporation of volatile ices. These smaller particles can be
produced for instance by spin-up and centrifugal mass loss of ejected larger
aggregates.

describes a more rigorous methodology to calculate the primary atomic recoil
events (often called the primary knock-on atoms or PKAs) that lead to cascade
damage events as a function of energy and recoiling species for any simulated

different recoiling species, potentially differing in both proton and neutron
number from the original target nuclei, including high energy recoils of light
emitted particles such as alpha-particles and protons. The variations in PKA

the intensity profile equals 0.5, this alone does not imply the presence of a
partially depleted core within this radius.

action of tensor perturbations on the isotropic cosmological background is of
the same form as that in General Relativity and study the role of couplings at
the levels of both background and linear perturbations. We show that the

Relativistic contribution and couplings induced by the modification of gravity.
For the theories in which the transformed action belongs to a class of

potentials in the Einstein frame due to a gravitational de-mixing. We propose a
concrete dark energy model encompassing Brans-Dicke theories as well as
theories with the tensor propagation speed $c_{\rm t}$ different from 1. We
clarify the correspondence between physical quantities in the Jordan/Einstein

obtained by quantizing the recently-introduced flux formulation of loop quantum
gravity. In this framework, the vacuum is peaked on flat connections, and
states are built upon it by creating local curvature excitations. The inner
product induces a discrete topology on the gauge group, which turns out to be
an essential ingredient for the construction of a continuum limit Hilbert
space. This leads to a representation of the full holonomy-flux algebra of loop
quantum gravity which is unitarily-inequivalent to the one based on the
Ashtekar-Isham-Lewandowski vacuum. It therefore provides a new notion of
quantum geometry. We discuss how the spectra of geometric operators, including
holonomy and area operators, are affected by this new quantization. In
particular, we find that the area operator is bounded, and that there are two
different ways in which the Barbero-Immirzi parameter can be taken into

investigating further realizations of quantum geometry based on different

formation of a penumbra, large inclinations at the outskirts of the protospot
are necessary. The penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral
areas and granulation. Evidence for a unique stable boundary value for the
vertical component of the magnetic field strength, $B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$,
was found along the umbra-penumbra boundary of developed sunspots. We use
broadband G-band images and spectropolarimetric GFPI/VTT data to study the
evolution of and the vertical component of the magnetic field on a forming
umbra-penumbra boundary. For comparison with stable sunspots, we also analyse
the two maps observed by Hinode/SP on the same spot after the penumbra formed.
The vertical component of the magnetic field, $B_{\rm ver}$, at the
umbra-penumbra boundary increases during penumbra formation owing to the
incursion of the penumbra into umbral areas. After 2.5 hours, the penumbra
reaches a stable state as shown by the GFPI data. At this stable stage, the
simultaneous Hinode/SP observations show a $B_{\rm ver}$ value comparable to
that of umbra-penumbra boundaries of fully fledged sunspots. We confirm that
the umbra-penumbra boundary, traditionally defined by an intensity threshold,
is also characterised by a distinct canonical magnetic property, namely by
$B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$. During the penumbra formation process, the inner
penumbra extends into regions where the umbra previously prevailed. Hence, in
areas where $B_{\rm ver} < B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$, the magneto-convection
mode operating in the umbra turns into a penumbral mode. Eventually, the inner
penumbra boundary settles at $B^{\rm stable}_{\rm ver}$, which hints toward the
role of $B_{\rm ver}^{\rm stable}$ as inhibitor of the penumbral mode of
magneto-convection.

However there is a special subset, when the transformation is not invertible,

These conclusions hold true irrespective of whether the scalar field in the

than the scalar field involved in the transformation. The new equations of
motion for our general mimetic theory can also be derived from an action
containing an additional Lagrange multiplier field. The general mimetic
scalar-tensor theory has the same number of derivatives in the equations of
motion as the original scalar-tensor theory. As an application we show that the
simplest mimetic scalar-tensor model is able to mimic the cosmological

multi-homed client with a network of heterogeneous wireless. Joint
Source-Channel Coding is effectively used to transmit video over
bandwidth-limited, noisy wireless networks. But most existing JSCC methods only
consider single path video transmission of the server and the client network.
The problem will become more complicated when consider multi-path video
transmission, because involving low-bandwidth, high-drop-rate or high-latency
wireless network will only reduce the video quality. To solve this critical
problem, we propose a novel Path Adaption JSCC (PA-JSCC) method that contain
below characters: (1) path adaption, and (2) dynamic rate allocation. We use
Exata to evaluate the performance of PA-JSCC and Experiment show that PA-JSCC
has a good results in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio).

of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in interplanetary space and allows the
prediction of their arrival times and impact speeds at any point in the
heliosphere (""target""). The DBM is based on the assumption that beyond a
distance of about 20 solar radii from the Sun, the dominant force acting on
CMEs is the ""aerodynamic"" drag force. In the standard form of DBM, the user
provisionally chooses values for the model input parameters, by which the
kinematics of the CME over the entire Sun--""target"" distance range is defined.
The choice of model input parameters is usually based on several previously
undertaken statistical studies. In other words, the model is used by ad hoc
implementation of statistics-based values of the input parameters, which are
not necessarily appropriate for the CME under study. Furthermore, such a
procedure lacks quantitative information on how well the simulation reproduces
the coronagraphically observed kinematics of the CME, and thus does not provide
an estimate of the reliability of the arrival prediction. In this paper we
advance the DBM by adopting it in a form that employs the CME observations over
a given distance range to evaluate the most suitable model input parameters for
a given CME by means of the least-squares fitting. Furthermore, the new version
of the model automatically responds to any significant change of the conditions
in the ambient medium (solar wind speed, density, CME--CME interactions, etc.)
by changing the model input parameters according to changes in the CME
kinematics. The advanced DBM is shaped in a form that can be readily employed
in an operational system for real-time space-weather forecasting by promptly
adjusting to a successively expanding observational dataset, thus providing a
successively improving prediction of the CME arrival.

a scattering potential which takes the form of an infinite barrier in the low
energy (near brane) limit for $p\leq 5$ and therefore is never able to reach
the branes. This shows, contrary to what is known in the literature, that
gravity indeed decouples from the non-susy D$p$ branes for $p \leq 5$. For
non-susy D6 brane, gravity couples as there is no such barrier for the
potential. To give further credence to our claim we solve the scattering
equation in some situation analytically and calculate the graviton absorption
cross-sections on the non-susy branes and show that they vanish for $p \leq 4$
in the low energy limit. This shows, as in the case of BPS branes, that gravity
does decouple for non-susy D$p$ branes for $p\leq 4$ but it does not decouple
for D6 brane as the potential here is always attractive. We argue for the
non-susy D5 brane that depending on one of the parameters of the solution
gravity either always decouples (unlike the BPS D5 brane) or it decouples when
the energy of the graviton is below certain critical value, otherwise it
couples, very similar to BPS D5 brane.

challenge in synthetic biology. Synthetic circuits must reliably function in
dynamic, stochastic and heterogeneous environments, and simple circuits can be
studied to refine complex gene-regulation models. Although robust behaviours
such as genetic oscillators have been designed and implemented in prokaryotic
and eukaryotic organisms, a priori genetic engineering of even simple networks
remains difficult, and many aspects of cell and molecular biology critical to
engineering robust networks are still inadequately characterized. Particularly,
periodic processes such as gene doubling and cell division are rarely
considered in gene regulatory models, which may become more important as
synthetic biologists utilize new tools for chromosome integration. We studied a
chromosome-integrated, negative-feedback circuit based upon the bacteriophage
{\lambda} transcriptional repressor Cro and observed strong, feedback-dependent
oscillations in single-cell time traces. This finding was surprising due to a
lack of cooperativity, long delays or fast protein degradation. We further show
that oscillations are synchronized to the cell cycle by gene duplication, with
phase shifts predictably correlating with estimated gene doubling times.
Furthermore, we characterized the influence of negative feedback on the
magnitude and dynamics of noise in gene expression. Our results show that
cell-cycle effects must be accounted for in accurate, predictive models for
even simple gene circuits. Cell-cycle-periodic expression of {\lambda} Cro also
suggests an explanation for cell-size dependence in lysis probability and an
evolutionary basis for site-specific {\lambda} integration.

mechanism. We show that under conditions prevailing in blazars, substantial
deceleration is anticipated on sub-parsec and parsec scales in cases of rapid
dissipation. Such episodes may be the origin of some of the flaring activity
occasionally observed in gamma ray blazars. The shape of the light curves
thereby produced reflects the geometry of the emitting surface if the
deceleration is very rapid, or the dynamics of the shell if the deceleration is
delayed, or initially more gradual, owing, e.g., to continuous injection of
energy and momentum.

degrees of freedom in the fluxonium circuit can limit the qubit coherence time.
Such a limitation is in principle possible, due to the interactions between the
low-energy, highly anharmonic qubit mode and the higher-energy, weakly
anharmonic collective modes. We show that so long as the coupling of the
collective modes with the external electromagnetic environment is sufficiently
weaker than the qubit-environment coupling, the qubit dephasing induced by the
collective modes does not significantly contribute to decoherence. Therefore,
the increased complexity of the fluxonium qubit does not constitute by itself a
major obstacle for its use in quantum computation architectures.

analytic functions over $\mathbb{R}^s$. The Hermite space is a weighted
reproducing kernel Hilbert space of real valued functions for which the Hermite
coefficients decay exponentially fast. The weights are defined in terms of two
sequences $\boldsymbol{a} = \{a_j\}$ and $\boldsymbol{b} = \{b_j\}$ of positive
real numbers. We study the $n$th minimal worst-case error $e(n,{\rm

evaluations from the class $\Lambda^{{\rm std}}$ which only allows function
evaluations to be used.
  We study (uniform) exponential convergence of the $n$th minimal worst-case
error, which means that $e(n,{\rm APP}_s; \Lambda^{{\rm std}})$ converges to
zero exponentially fast with increasing $n$. Furthermore, we consider how the
error depends on the dimension $s$. To this end, we study the minimal number of
information evaluations needed to compute an $\varepsilon$-approximation by
considering several notions of tractability which are defined with respect to
$s$ and $\log \varepsilon^{-1}$. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions
on the sequences $\boldsymbol{a}$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$ for obtaining
exponential error convergence, and also for obtaining the various notions of
tractability. It turns out that the conditions on the weight sequences are
almost the same as for the information class $\Lambda^{{\rm all}}$ which uses
all linear functionals. The results are also constructive as the considered
algorithms are based on tensor products of Gauss-Hermite rules for multivariate
integration. The obtained results are compared with the analogous results for
integration in the same Hermite space. This allows us to give a new sufficient
condition for EC-weak tractability for integration.

of large scale continuous computations in the cloud, targeting both low latency

providing processing guarantees under potential failures. Existing approaches
rely on periodic global state snapshots that can be used for failure recovery.
Those approaches suffer from two main drawbacks. First, they often stall the
overall computation which impacts ingestion. Second, they eagerly persist all
records in transit along with the operation states which results in larger
snapshots than required. In this work we propose Asynchronous Barrier
Snapshotting (ABS), a lightweight algorithm suited for modern dataflow
execution engines that minimises space requirements. ABS persists only operator
states on acyclic execution topologies while keeping a minimal record log on
cyclic dataflows. We implemented ABS on Apache Flink, a distributed analytics
engine that supports stateful stream processing. Our evaluation shows that our
algorithm does not have a heavy impact on the execution, maintaining linear
scalability and performing well with frequent snapshots.

to the understanding of the global behavior of the donor companion by including
optical data from our dedicated campaign starting on 2006. Methods: V 0332+53
was observed by RXTE and Swift during the decay of the intermediate-luminosity
X-ray outburst of 2008, as well as with Suzaku before the rising of the third
normal outburst of the 2010 series. In addition, we present recent data from
the Spanish ground-based astronomical observatories of El Teide (Tenerife),
Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma), and Sierra Nevada (Granada), and since 2006
from the Turkish TUBITAK National Observatory (Antalya). We have performed
temporal analyses to investigate the transient behaviour of this system during
several outbursts. Results: Our optical study revealed that continuous mass
ejection episodes from the Be star have been taking place since 2006 and
another one is currently ongoing. The broad-band 1-60 keV X-ray spectrum of the
neutron star during the decay of the 2008 outburst was well fitted with
standard phenomenological models, enhanced by an absorption feature of unknown
origin at about 10 keV and a narrow iron K-alpha fluorescence line at 6.4 keV.
For the first time in V 0332+53 we tentatively see an increase of the cyclotron
line energy with increasing flux (although further and more sensitive
observations are needed to confirm this). Regarding the fast aperiodic
variability, we detect a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) at 227+-9 mHz only
during the lowest luminosities. The latter fact might indicate that the inner
regions surrounding the magnetosphere are more visible during the lowest flux
states.

a $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading channel in the presence of an eavesdropper, who also
observes $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading. In particular, we obtain novel analytical
solutions for the probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC) and
the lower bound of secure outage probability (SOP$^L$) for channel coefficients
that are positive, real, independent and non-identically distributed
($i.n.i.d.$). We also provide a closed-form expression for the probability of
SPSC when the $\mu$ parameter is assumed to only take positive integer values.
We then apply the derived results to assess the secrecy performance of the
system in terms of the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the
$\kappa$ and $\mu$ fading parameters. We observed that for fixed values of the
eavesdropper's average SNR, increases in the average SNR of the main channel
produce a higher probability of SPSC and a lower secure outage probability
(SOP). It was also found that when the main channel experiences a higher
average SNR than the eavesdropper's channel, the probability of SPSC improved
while the SOP was found to decrease with increasing values of $\kappa$ and
$\mu$ for the legitimate channel. The versatility of the $\kappa$-$\mu$ fading
model, means that the results presented in this paper can be used to determine
the probability of SPSC and SOP$^L$ for a large number of other fading
scenarios such as Rayleigh, Rice (Nakagami-$n$), Nakagami-$m$, One-Sided
Gaussian and mixtures of these common fading models. Additionally, due to the
duality of the analysis of secrecy capacity and co-channel interference, the
results presented here will also have immediate applicability in the analysis

any dark matter clumps. On the other hand, even under the most pessimistic
assumption about the clump structure, the clumps should have survived in the

geometry of the organic ligands and metallic ions; and (ii) combinatorics. The
molecular geometry is used to introduce an energy that favors square-planar
vertices (modeling $\mathrm{Pd}^{2+}$ ions) and bent edges with one of two
preferred opening angles (modeling boomerang-shaped ligands of two types). The
combinatorics of the model involve $2$-colorings of edges of polyhedra with
$4$-valent vertices. The set of such $2$-colorings, quotiented by the
octahedral symmetry group, has a natural graph structure, and is called the
combinatorial configuration space. The energy landscape of our model is the
energy of each state in the combinatorial configuration space.
  The challenge in the computation of the energy landscape is a combinatorial
explosion in the number of $2$-colorings of edges. We describe sampling methods
based on the symmetries of the configurations and connectivity of the
configuration graph. When the two preferred opening angles encompass the
geometrically ideal angle, the energy landscape exhibits a very low-energy
minimum for the most symmetric configuration at equal mixing of the two angles,
even when the average opening angle does not match the ideal angle.

equation of motion. Therefore, well-known physical spacetimes like
Schwarzschild, Kerr, (Anti-) de Sitter serve as solutions for standard matter
content. In dimension higher than four we can also have Anti-de Sitter
solutions in the presence of positive cosmological constant. We pedagogically
show how to obtain these exact solutions. Furthermore, for another version of
the theory, written in the Weyl basis, Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
spacetimes are also exact solutions, when the matter content is given by
conformal matter (radiation). We also comment on the presence of singularities

floating point number $z$ in the interval $[X_0,X_N)$, a common problem is to
find the index $i$ of the interval $[X_{i},X_{i+1})$ containing $z$. This
problem arises for instance in the context of spline interpolation or the
computation of empirical probability distribution from empirical data. Often it
needs to be solved for a large number of different values $z$ and the same
array $X$, which makes it worth investing resources upfront in pre-processing
the array $X$ with the goal of speeding up subsequent search operations. In
some cases the values $z$ to be processed are known simultaneously in blocks of
size $M$, which offers the opportunity to solve the problem vectorially,
exploiting the parallel capabilities of modern CPUs. The common solution is to
sequentially invoke $M$ times the well known binary search algorithm, which has
complexity $O(log_2 N)$ per individual search and, in its classic formulation,
is not vectorizable, i.e. is not SIMD friendly. This paper describes technical
improvements to the binary search algorithm, which make it faster and
vectorizable. Next it proposes a new vectorizable algorithm, based on an
indexing technique, applicable to a wide family of $X$ partitions, which solves
the problem with complexity $O(1)$ per individual search at the cost of
introducing an initial overhead to compute the index and requiring extra memory
for its storage. Test results using streaming SIMD extensions compare the
performance of the algorithm versus various benchmarks and demonstrate its
effectiveness. Depending on the test case, the algorithm can produce a
throughput up to two orders of magnitude larger than the classic binary search.
Applicability limitations and cache-friendliness related aspects are also
discussed.

excitation of a second phonon [Phys. Rev. A 82, 032101 (2010)]. This
intrinsically quantum effect is called phonon blockade, and is an analog of
Coulomb blockade and photon blockade. Here we predict tunable multiphonon
blockade in coupled nonlinear NAMRs, where nonlinearity is induced by two-level
systems (TLSs) assuming dispersive (far off-resonance) interactions.
Specifically, we derive an effective Kerr-type interaction in a hybrid system
consisting of two nonlinearly-interacting NAMRs coupled to two TLSs and driven
by classical fields. The interaction between a given NAMR and a TLS is
described by a Jaynes-Cummings-like model. We show that by properly tuning the
frequency of the driving fields one can induce various types of phonon
blockade, corresponding to the entangled phonon states of either two qubits,
qutrit and quartit, or two qudits. Thus, a $k$-phonon Fock state (with
$k=1,2,3$) can impede the excitation of more phonons in a given NAMR, which we
interpret as a $k$-phonon blockade (or, equivalently, phonon tunneling). Our
results can be explained in terms of resonant transitions in the Fock space and
via phase-space interference using the $s$-parametrized Cahill-Glauber
quasiprobability distributions including the Wigner function. We study the
nonclassicality, entanglement, and dimensionality of the blockaded phonon
states during both dynamics and in the stationary limits.

(LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of $\kappa-\mu$ shadowed fading channels

correlation between the time derivative of the shadowed dominant and multipath
components of the $\kappa-\mu$ shadowed fading envelope. Verification of the
new equations is performed by reduction to a number of known special cases. It
is shown that as the shadowing of the resultant dominant component decreases,
the signal crosses lower threshold levels at a reduced rate. Furthermore, the
impact of increasing correlation between the slope of the shadowed dominant and
multipath components similarly acts to reduce crossings at lower signal levels.
The new expressions for the second-order statistics are also compared with
field measurements obtained for cellular device-to-device and body centric
communications channels which are known to be susceptible to shadowed fading.

costly challenge to public health programs. The preferences and social dynamics
of a population can have a large impact on the course of an outbreak as well as
the effectiveness of interventions intended to influence individual behavior.
In addition, individuals may alter their sexual behavior in response to the
presence of STIs, creating a feedback loop between transmission and behavior.
We investigate the consequences of modeling the interaction between STI
transmission and prophylactic use with a model that links a
Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) system to evolutionary game dynamics
that determine the effective contact rate. The combined model framework allows
us to address protective behavior by both infected and susceptible individuals.
Feedback between behavioral adaptation and prevalence creates a wide range of
dynamic behaviors in the combined model, including damped and sustained
oscillations as well as bistability, depending on the behavioral parameters and
disease growth rate. We found that disease extinction is possible for multiple
regions where R0 > 1, due to behavior adaptation driving the epidemic downward,
although conversely endemic prevalence for arbitrarily low R0 is also possible
if contact rates are sufficiently high. We also tested how model
misspecification might affect disease forecasting and estimation of the model
parameters and R0. We found that alternative models that neglect the behavioral
feedback or only consider behavior adaptation by susceptible individuals can
potentially yield misleading parameter estimates or omit significant features
of the disease trajectory.

and demonstrate strategies to suppress the effect of these. A universal set of
logic gates in a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond are reported with an
average single-qubit gate fidelity of 0.999952 and two-qubit gate fidelity of
0.992. These high control fidelities have been achieved at room temperature in
naturally abundant 13C diamond via composite pulses and an optimized control
method.

core-collapse supernova pose a challenging, seven-dimensional flavor transport
problem. To make the problem even more difficult (and interesting), neutrinos
can experience collective oscillations through nonlinear refraction in the
dense neutrino medium in this environment. Significant progress has been made
in the last decade towards the understanding of collective neutrino
oscillations in various simplified neutrino gas models with imposed symmetries
and reduced dimensions. However, a series of recent studies seem to have
""reset"" this progress by showing that these models may not be compatible with
collective neutrino oscillations because the latter can break the symmetries
spontaneously if they are not imposed. We review some of the key concepts of
collective neutrino oscillations by using a few simple toy models. We also
elucidate the breaking of spatial and directional symmetries in these models
because of collective oscillations.

carry out a detailed analysis of the chemical abundances of alpha, iron peak,

ultra faint dwarf stellar populations. We show that the bulk of the Sculptor
metal-poor stars follows the same trends in abundance ratios versus metallicity
as the Milky Way stars. This suggests similar early conditions of star
formation and a high degree of homogeneity of the interstellar medium. We find
an outlier to this main regime, which seems to miss the products of the most
massive of the TypeII supernovae. In addition to its value to help refining
galaxy formation models, this star provides clues to the production of cobalt
and zinc. Two of our sample stars have low odd-to-even barium isotope abundance
ratios, suggestive of a fair proportion of s-process; we discuss the
implication for the nucleosynthetic origin of the neutron capture elements.

node, and should be transmitted through a network to the intended destination
node. The status updates are samples of a random process under observation,
transmitted as packets, which also contain the time stamp to identify when the
sample was generated. The age of the information available to the destination
node is the time elapsed since the last received update was generated. In this
paper, we model the source-destination link using queuing theory, and we assume
that the time it takes to successfully transmit a packet to the destination is
an exponentially distributed service time. We analyze the age of information in
the case that the source node has the capability to manage the arriving
samples, possibly discarding packets in order to avoid wasting network
resources with the transmission of stale information. In addition to
characterizing the average age, we propose a new metric, called peak age, which
provides information about the maximum value of the age, achieved immediately
before receiving an update.

function in lattice simulations. This can then be used, e.g., to determine the
leading hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The
method is based on computing susceptibilities with respect to external
electromagnetic plane wave fields and allows for a precision determination of
both the connected and the disconnected contributions to the vacuum
polarization. We demonstrate that the statistical errors obtained with our
method are much smaller than those quoted in previous lattice studies,
primarily due to a very effective suppression of the errors of the disconnected
terms. These turn out to vanish within small errors, enabling us to quote an
upper limit. We also comment on the accuracy of the vacuum polarization
function determined from present experimental R-ratio data.

required to model the process of diffusion of innovations, namely, social
influence (i.e., individuals become more similar when they interact) and
homophily (i.e., individuals interact preferentially with similar others). The
strength of these social influences are controlled by two parameters: $F$, the
number of features that characterizes the cultures and $q$, the common number
of states each feature can assume. Here we assume that the innovation is a new
state of a cultural feature of a single individual -- the innovator -- and
study how the innovation spreads through the networks among the individuals.
For infinite regular lattices in one (1D) and two dimensions (2D), we find that
initially the successful innovation spreads linearly with the time $t$, but in
the long-time limit it spreads diffusively ($\sim t^{1/2}$) in 1D and
sub-diffusively ($\sim t/\ln t$) in 2D. For finite lattices, the growth curves
for the number of adopters are typically concave functions of $t$. For random
graphs with a finite number of nodes $N$, we argue that the classical S-shaped
growth curves result from a trade-off between the average connectivity $K$ of
the graph and the per feature diversity $q$. A large $q$ is needed to reduce
the pace of the initial spreading of the innovation and thus delimit the
early-adopters stage, whereas a large $K$ is necessary to ensure the onset of
the take-off stage at which the number of adopters grows superlinearly with
$t$. In an infinite random graph we find that the number of adopters of a
successful innovation scales with $t^\gamma$ with $\gamma =1$ for $K> 2$ and
$1/2 < \gamma < 1$ for $K=2$. We suggest that the exponent $\gamma$ may be a
useful index to characterize the process of diffusion of successful innovations
in diverse scenarios.

is revisited within the higher twist formalism. In particular, the in-medium
modification of ""semi-hard"" heavy quarks is studied, where the momentum of the
heavy quark is larger but comparable to the mass of the heavy quark ($p \gtrsim
M$). In contrast to all prior calculations, where the gluon emission spectrum
is entirely controlled by the transverse momentum diffusion parameter ($\hat
q$), both for light and heavy quarks, in this work, we demonstrate that the
gluon emission spectrum for a heavy quark (unlike that for flavors) is also
sensitive to $\hat e$, which so far has been used to quantify the amount of
light-cone drag experienced by a parton. This mass dependent effect, due to the
non-light-like momentum of a semi-hard heavy-quark, leads to an additional
energy loss term for heavy-quarks, while resulting in a negligible modification
of light flavor (and high energy heavy flavor) loss. This result can be used to
estimate the value of this sub-leading non-perturbative jet transport parameter
($\hat e$) from heavy flavor suppression in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion
collisions.

gravitational-wave backgrounds to backgrounds which have non-GR polarisations.
Our analysis and results are presented in the context of pulsar-timing array
observations, but the overarching methods are general, and can be easily
applied to LIGO or eLISA observations using appropriately modified response
functions. Analytic expressions for the pulsar-timing response to gravitational
waves with non-GR polarisation are given for each mode of a spin-weighted
spherical-harmonic decomposition of the background, which permit the signal to
be mapped across the sky to any desired resolution. We also derive the
pulsar-timing overlap reduction functions for the various non-GR polarisations,
finding analytic forms for anisotropic backgrounds with scalar-transverse
(""breathing"") and vector-longitudinal polarisations, and a semi-analytic form
for scalar-longitudinal backgrounds. Our results indicate that pulsar-timing
observations will be completely insensitive to scalar-transverse mode
anisotropies in the polarisation amplitude beyond dipole, and anisotropies in
the power beyond quadrupole. Analogously to our previous findings that
pulsar-timing observations lack sensitivity to tensor-curl modes for a
transverse-traceless tensor background, we also find insensitivity to
vector-curl modes for a vector-longitudinal background.

Currently the only analytic method available to approximate $p_n$ is large
deviations analysis, which gives the exponential decay rate of $p_n$. Finer
results are available via rare event simulation. The present article develops a
new method to approximate $p_n$ and related expectations. The method has two
steps: 1) with an affine transformation, move the origin onto the exit boundary
of $\tau_n$, take limits to remove some of the constraints on the dynamics,
this yields a limit unstable constrained walk $Y$ 2) Construct a basis of
harmonic functions of $Y$ and use them to apply the classical superposition
principle of linear analysis. The basis functions are linear combinations of
$\log$-linear functions and come from solutions of ""harmonic systems,"" which
are graphs whose vertices represent points on the ""characteristic surface"" of
$Y$, the edges between the vertices represent conjugacy relations between the
points, the loops represent membership in ""the boundary characteristic
surfaces."" Using our method we derive explicit, simple and almost exact
formulas for $P_x(\tau_n < \tau_0)$ for $d$-tandem queues, similar to the
product form formulas for the stationary distribution of $X$. The same method
allows us to approximate the Balayage operator mapping $f$ to $x \rightarrow
{\mathbb E}_x \left[ f(X_{\tau_n}) 1_{\{\tau_n < \tau_0\}} \right]$ for a range
of stable constrained random walks in $2$ dimensions. We indicate how the ideas

to determine the transport coefficients associated with the mass, momentum and
heat fluxes of a granular binary mixture in spatially inhomogeneous states
close to the simple shear flow. The Boltzmann equation is solved by means of a
Chapman-Enskog-like expansion around the (local) shear flow distributions
$f_r^{(0)}$ for each species that retain all the hydrodynamic orders in the
shear rate. Due to the anisotropy induced by the shear flow, tensorial
quantities are required to describe the transport processes instead of the
conventional scalar coefficients. These tensors are given in terms of the
solutions of a set of coupled equations, which can be analytically solved as
functions of the shear rate $a$, the coefficients of restitution $\alpha_{rs}$
and the parameters of the mixture (masses, diameters and composition). Since
the reference distribution functions $f_r^{(0)}$ apply for arbitrary values of
the shear rate and are not restricted to weak dissipation, the corresponding
generalized coefficients turn out to be nonlinear functions of both $a$ and
$\alpha_{rs}$. The dependence of the relevant elements of the three diffusion
tensors on both the shear rate and dissipation is illustrated in the tracer
limit case, the results showing that the deviation of the generalized transport
coefficients from their forms for vanishing shear rates is in general
significant. A comparison with the previous results obtained analytically for
inelastic hard spheres by using Grad's moment method is carried out showing a
good agreement over a wide range of values for the coefficients of restitution.
Finally, as an application of the theoretical expressions derived here for the
transport coefficients, thermal diffusion segregation of an intruder immersed
in a granular gas is also studied.

stochastic even in large populations. The uncertainty emerges from number
fluctuations, called genetic drift, arising in the small number of particularly
fit individuals of the population. Random genetic drift in this evolutionary
vanguard also limits the speed of adaptation, which diverges in deterministic
models that ignore these chance effects. Several approaches have been developed
to analyze the crucial role of noise on the expected dynamics of adaptation,
including the mean fitness of the entire population, or the fate of newly
arising beneficial deleterious mutations. However, very little is known about
how genetic drift causes fluctuations to emerge on the population level,
including fitness distribution variations and speed variations. Yet, these
phenomena control the replicability of experimental evolution experiments and
are key to a truly predictive understanding of evolutionary processes. Here, we
develop an exact approach to these emergent fluctuations by a combination of
computational and analytical methods. We show, analytically, that the infinite
hierarchy of moment equations can be closed at any arbitrary order by a
suitable choice of a dynamical constraint. This constraint regulates (rather
than fixes) the population size, accounting for resource limitations. The
resulting linear equations, which can be accurately solved numerically, exhibit
fluctuation-induced terms that amplify short-distance correlations and suppress
long-distance ones. Importantly, by accounting for the dynamics of
sub-populations, we provide a systematic route to key population genetic
quantities, such as fixation probabilities and decay rates of the genetic
diversity.

particles that the LHC could discover. We consider the possibility that one
such triplet could account for the ATLAS excess in the invariant-mass spectrum
of boson-tagged jets and we assess the compatibility of this hypothesis with
all other relevant resonance searches. We find that the hypothesis is not
excluded and that the predicted signal is close to the expected sensitivity of
several channels, some of which show an upper fluctuation of the observed limit
while others do not. An accurate study of the signal compatibility with these
fluctuations could only be performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.

Chebyshev orthogonal collocation enabling fast and accurate simulations up to

combination with an extended Kalman filter algorithm for differential-algebraic

is able to rapidly recover the model states from current, voltage and

broadband noise in several aeroacoustic applications is extended to realise
isotropic turbulence spectra. With this method turbulent fluctuations are
synthesised by filtering white noise with a Gaussian filter kernel that in turn
gives a Gaussian spectrum. The Gaussian function is smooth and its derivatives
and integrals are again Gaussian functions. The Gaussian filter is efficient
and finds wide-spread applications in stochastic signal processing. However in
many applications Gaussian spectra do not correspond to real turbulence
spectra. Thus in turbo-machines the von K\'arm\'an, Liepmann, and modified von
K\'arm\'an spectra are more realistic model spectra. In this note we
analytically derive weighting functions to realise arbitrary isotropic
solenoidal spectra using a superposition of weighted Gaussian spectra of
different length scales. The analytic weighting functions for the von
K\'arm\'an, the Liepmann, and the modified von K\'arm\'an spectra are derived
subsequently. Finally a method is proposed to discretise the problem using a
limited number of Gaussian spectra. The effectivity of this approach is
demonstrated by realising a von K\'arm\'an velocity spectrum using the RPM
method.

been proposed to quantify the strength of cross-correlations on different
temporal scales in bivariate, non-stationary time series. It is based on the
detrended cross-correlation and detrended fluctuation analyses (DCCA and DFA,
respectively) and can be viewed as an analogue of the Pearson coefficient in
the case of the fluctuation analysis. The coefficient $\rho_{\rm DCCA}$ works
well in many practical situations but by construction its applicability is
limited to detection of whether two signals are generally cross-correlated,
without possibility to obtain information on the amplitude of fluctuations that
are responsible for those cross-correlations. In order to introduce some
related flexibility, here we propose an extension of $\rho_{\rm DCCA}$ that
exploits the multifractal versions of DFA and DCCA: MFDFA and MFCCA,
respectively. The resulting new coefficient $\rho_q$ not only is able to
quantify the strength of correlations, but also it allows one to identify the
range of detrended fluctuation amplitudes that are correlated in two signals
under study. We show how the coefficient $\rho_q$ works in practical situations
by applying it to stochastic time series representing processes with long
memory: autoregressive and multiplicative ones. Such processes are often used
to model signals recorded from complex systems and complex physical phenomena
like turbulence, so we are convinced that this new measure can successfully be
applied in time series analysis. In particular, we present an example of such
application to highly complex empirical data from financial markets. The
present formulation can straightforwardly be extended to multivariate data in
terms of the $q$-dependent counterpart of the correlation matrices and then to
the network representation.

potential varying in one dimension is obtained by applying a novel for this
problem approach using multiple scattering theory (MST) for the calculation of
the space-time propagator. This approach, based on the localized at the
potential jumps effective potentials responsible for transmission through and
reflection from the considered rectangular potential, enables considering these
processes from a particle (rather than a wave) point of view. The solution
describes these quantum phenomena as a function of time and is related to the
fundamental issues (such as measuring time) of quantum mechanics. It is
presented in terms of integrals of elementary functions and is a sum of the
forward- and backward-moving components of the wave packet. The relative
contribution of these components and their interference as well as of the
potential asymmetry to the probability density $|\psi(x,t)|^2$ and particle
dwell time is considered and numerically visualized for narrow and broad energy
(momentum) distributions of the initial Gaussian wave packet. The obtained
solution is also related to the kinetic theory of nanostructures due to the
fact that the considered potential can model the spin-dependent potential
profile of the magnetic multilayers used in spintronics devices.

planning and operations. They are routinely solved using Newton-Raphson like
methods. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when these

long they may take to converge. Further, it is known that in general these
equations have multiple solutions and can exhibit chaotic behavior. In this
paper, we show that the power flow equations can be solved efficiently provided
that the solution lies in a certain set. We introduce a family of convex
domains, characterized by Linear Matrix Inequalities, in the space of voltages
such that there is at most one power flow solution in each of these domains.
Further, if a solution exists in one of these domains, it can be found
efficiently, and if one does not exist, a certificate of non-existence can also
be obtained efficiently. The approach is based on the theory of monotone
operators and related algorithms for solving variational inequalities involving
monotone operators. We validate our approach on IEEE test networks and show
that practical power flow solutions lie within an appropriately chosen convex
domain.

that, under certain conditions, an excess of the individuals' vigor in the

identified by the appearance of a minimum when plotting the total evacuation
time of a crowd as a function of the pedestrian desired velocity. Here, we
experimentally show that the FIS effect indeed occurs in three different
