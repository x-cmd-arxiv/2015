  transparent nano-heaters",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thermally-tuning silicon micro-cavities are versatile and beneficial elements
in low-cost large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Traditional metal
heaters used for thermal tuning in silicon micro-cavities usually need a thick
SiO2 upper-cladding layer, which will introduce some disadvantages including
low response speed, low heating efficiency, low achievable temperature and
complicated fabrication processes. In this paper, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate thermally-tuning silicon micro-disk resonators by introducing
graphene transparent nano-heaters, which contacts the silicon core directly
without any isolator layer. This makes the graphene transparent nano-heater
potentially to have excellent performances in terms of the heating efficiency,
the temporal response and the achievable temperature. It is also shown that the
graphene nano-heater is convenient to be used in ultrasmall photonic integrated
devices due to the single-atom thickness and excellent flexibility of graphene.
Both experiments and simulations imply that the present graphene transparent
nano-heater is promising for thermally-tuning nanophotonic integrated devices
for e.g. optical modulating, optical filtering/switching, etc.

results are compared with the case of a single layer network that is an
aggregated representation of the two layers. We find that systemic risk in the
two-layer network is smaller than in the aggregated one only if the coupling
strength between the two layers is small. Above a critical coupling strength,
systemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification of cascades in
the two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade size
that are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied
to a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into
a less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases,
this may lead to a drastic increase of systemic risk, which is underestimated
in an aggregated approach.

on top of an impurity we reveal the existence of a star shaped pattern which
extends as far as 12 nm from the impurity location. This large spatial

interference fringes with a particle-hole asymmetry. Our theoretical approach
captures these features and relates them to the electronic band structure and

of data from heterogeneous settings, used widely in statistics and other
disciplines. I apply this framework to the evidence from 7 randomized
experiments of expanding access to microcredit to assess the general impact of
the intervention on household outcomes and the heterogeneity in this impact
across sites. The results suggest that the effect of microcredit is likely to
be positive but small relative to control group average levels, and the
possibility of a negative impact cannot be ruled out. By contrast, common
meta-analytic methods that pool all the data without assessing the
heterogeneity misleadingly produce ""statistically significant"" results in 2 of
the 6 household outcomes. Standard pooling metrics for the studies indicate on
average 60% pooling on the treatment effects, suggesting that the site-specific
effects are reasonably externally valid, and thus informative for each other
and for the general case. The cross-study heterogeneity is almost entirely
generated by heterogeneous effects for the 27% households who previously
operated businesses before microcredit expansion, although this group is likely
to see much larger impacts overall. A Ridge regression procedure to assess the
correlations between site-specific covariates and treatment effects indicates
that the remaining heterogeneity is strongly correlated with differences in
economic variables, but not with differences in study design protocols. The
average interest rate and the average loan size have the strongest correlation
with the treatment effects, and both are negative.

$3$-profiles are generalizations of triangle counts that specify the number of

can be used to approximate the full $3$-profile counts for a given large graph.
Further, we study the problem of estimating local and ego $3$-profiles, two
graph quantities that characterize the local neighborhood of each vertex of a
graph.
  Our algorithm is distributed and operates as a vertex program over the
GraphLab PowerGraph framework. We introduce the concept of edge pivoting which
allows us to collect $2$-hop information without maintaining an explicit
$2$-hop neighborhood list at each vertex. This enables the computation of all
the local $3$-profiles in parallel with minimal communication.

important to evaluate the theory predictions as accurately as possible with

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) usage mode presents both an opportunity and
a challenge: The opportunity is that programmers can potentially trade
resources for performance on a much larger scale, for much shorter periods of

heterogeneous IaaS that guarantees increased resources result in the greatest
possible increased performance. Such a trade-off is Pareto optimal. The Pareto
optimal trade-off for clusters of heterogeneous resources can be found by
solving multiple, multi-objective optimisation problems, resulting in an
optimal allocation of tasks to the available platforms. Solving these
optimisation programs can be done using simple heuristic approaches or formal
Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques. When pricing 128 financial
options using a Monte Carlo algorithm upon a heterogeneous cluster of Multicore
CPU, GPU and FPGA platforms, the MILP approach produces a trade-off that is up
to 110% faster than a heuristic approach, and over 50% cheaper. These results
suggest that high quality performance-resource trade-offs of heterogeneous IaaS
are best realised through a formal optimisation approach.

permutations closed downwards under the subpermutation order.
  First, we consider monotone grid classes of permutations. We present
procedures for calculating the generating function of any class whose matrix
has dimensions $m \times 1$ for some $m$, and of acyclic and unicyclic classes
of gridded permutations. We show that almost all large permutations in a grid
class have the same shape, and determine this limit shape.
  We prove that the growth rate of a grid class is given by the square of the
spectral radius of an associated graph and deduce some facts relating to the
set of grid class growth rates. In the process, we establish a new result
concerning tours on graphs. We also prove a similar result relating the growth
rate of a geometric grid class to the matching polynomial of a graph, and
determine the effect of edge subdivision on the matching polynomial. We
characterise the growth rates of geometric grid classes in terms of the
spectral radii of trees.
  We then investigate the set of growth rates of permutation classes and
establish a new upper bound on the value above which every real number is the
growth rate of some permutation class. In the process, we prove new results
concerning expansions of real numbers in non-integer bases in which the digits
are drawn from sets of allowed values.
  Finally, we introduce a new enumeration technique, based on associating a
graph with each permutation, and determine the generating functions for some
previously unenumerated classes. We conclude by using this approach to provide
an improved lower bound on the growth rate of the class of permutations
avoiding the pattern $1324$. In the process, we prove that, asymptotically,
patterns in {\L}ukasiewicz paths exhibit a concentrated Gaussian distribution.

history and their dynamical environment over the next 4.5 Gyr. The mere
existence of these systems provides a laboratory to study numerous types of
physical processes acting on asteroids and their dynamics provide a valuable
probe of their physical properties otherwise possible only with spacecraft.
  Advances in understanding the formation and evolution of binary systems have
been assisted by: 1) the growing catalog of known systems, increasing from 33
to nearly 250 between the Merline et al. (2002) Asteroids III chapter and now,
2) the detailed study and long-term monitoring of individual systems such as
1999 KW4 and 1996 FG3, 3) the discovery of new binary system morphologies and
triple systems, 4) and the discovery of unbound systems that appear to be
end-states of binary dynamical evolutionary paths.
  Specifically for small bodies (diameter smaller than 10 km), these
observations and discoveries have motivated theoretical work finding that
thermal forces can efficiently drive the rotational disruption of small
asteroids. Long-term monitoring has allowed studies to constrain the system's
dynamical evolution by the combination of tides, thermal forces and rigid body
physics. The outliers and split pairs have pushed the theoretical work to

are always classical irrespective of the input, i.e., if the channel is
nonclassicality breaking, and nonclassical otherwise. Our condition is stronger
than the one considered by Rahimi-Keshari et al. [PRL {\bf 110}, 160401 (2013)]

nonclassicality of a quantum process by introducing a noise-robustness type of
measure that we call as the nonclassicality depth of a channel. It
characterizes a certain threshold noise beyond which a given channel outputs
only classical states. We achieve this by generalizing a prescription by Lee

multimode channels.

data for regression, classification and clustering. For continuous data which
we consider here in the context of regression and cluster analysis, MoE usually
use normal experts, that is, expert components following the Gaussian
distribution. However, for a set of data containing a group or groups of
observations with asymmetric behavior, heavy tails or atypical observations,
the use of normal experts may be unsuitable and can unduly affect the fit of
the MoE model. In this paper, we introduce new non-normal mixture of experts
(NNMoE) which can deal with these issues regarding possibly skewed,
heavy-tailed data and with outliers. The proposed models are the skew-normal
MoE and the robust $t$ MoE and skew $t$ MoE, respectively named SNMoE, TMoE and
STMoE. We develop dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) and expectation
conditional maximization (ECM) algorithms to estimate the parameters of the
proposed models by monotonically maximizing the observed data log-likelihood.
We describe how the presented models can be used in prediction and in
model-based clustering of regression data. Numerical experiments carried out on
simulated data show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed models
in terms modeling non-linear regression functions as well as in model-based
clustering. Then, to show their usefulness for practical applications, the
proposed models are applied to the real-world data of tone perception for
musical data analysis, and the one of temperature anomalies for the analysis of
climate change data.

sets is to partition the data into smaller pieces, solve the problem on each
piece and compute a representative solution from it, and finally obtain a
solution inside the union of the representative solutions for all pieces. This
technique can be captured via the concept of {\em composable core-sets}, and
has been recently applied to solve diversity maximization problems as well as
several clustering problems. However, for coverage and submodular maximization
problems, impossibility bounds are known for this technique \cite{IMMM14}. In
this paper, we focus on efficient construction of a randomized variant of
composable core-sets where the above idea is applied on a {\em random
clustering} of the data. We employ this technique for the coverage, monotone
and non-monotone submodular maximization problems. Our results significantly
improve upon the hardness results for non-randomized core-sets, and imply
improved results for submodular maximization in a distributed and streaming
settings.
  In summary, we show that a simple greedy algorithm results in a
$1/3$-approximate randomized composable core-set for submodular maximization
under a cardinality constraint. This is in contrast to a known $O({\log k\over
\sqrt{k}})$ impossibility result for (non-randomized) composable core-set. Our
result also extends to non-monotone submodular functions, and leads to the
first 2-round MapReduce-based constant-factor approximation algorithm with
$O(n)$ total communication complexity for either monotone or non-monotone
functions. Finally, using an improved analysis technique and a new algorithm
$\mathsf{PseudoGreedy}$, we present an improved $0.545$-approximation algorithm
for monotone submodular maximization, which is in turn the first
MapReduce-based algorithm beating factor $1/2$ in a constant number of rounds.

guarantees a full account of all frequency components. The description is
accompanied by the examples demonstrating a simplicity and high efficiency of
our method. In particular, for three-level $\Lambda$-system we calculate the
lineshape and field-induced shift of the dark resonance formed by the field
with periodically modulated phase. For two-level atom we obtain the analytical
expressions for signal of the direct frequency comb spectroscopy with
rectangular light pulses. In this case it was shown the radical dependence of
the spectroscopy lineshape on pulse area. Moreover, the existence of
quasi-forbidden spectroscopic zones, in which the Ramsey fringes are
significantly reduced, is found. The obtained results have a wide area of
applications in the laser physics and spectroscopy, and they can stimulate the
search of new excitation schemes for atomic clock. Also our results can be
useful for many-body physics.

the interference of electronic waves in solids is complicated by boundary
properties of the crystal, notably leading to electron guiding by atomic-scale
potentials at the edges. Understanding the microscopic role of boundaries on
coherent wave interference is an unresolved question due to the challenge of
detecting charge flow with submicron resolution. Here we employ Fraunhofer
interferometry to achieve real-space imaging of cavity modes in a graphene
Fabry-Perot resonator, embedded between two superconductors to form a Josephson
junction. By directly visualizing current flow using Fourier methods, our
measurements reveal surprising redistribution of current on and off resonance.
These findings provide direct evidence of separate interference conditions for
edge and bulk currents and reveal the ballistic nature of guided edge states.
Beyond equilibrium, our measurements show strong modulation of the multiple
Andreev reflection amplitude on an off resonance, a direct measure of the
gate-tunable change of cavity transparency. These results demonstrate that,
contrary to the common belief, electron interactions with realistic disordered
edges facilitate electron wave interference and ballistic transport.

their natal protostellar disks. We compute both the total amino acid abundance
pattern as well as the relative frequencies of amino acids within the CM2 (e.g.
Murchison) and CR2 chondrite subclasses based on Strecker reactions within
these bodies. We match the relative frequencies to well within an order of
magnitude among both CM2 and CR2 meteorites for parent body temperatures $<$
200$^{\circ}$C. These temperatures agree with 3D models of young planetesimal
interiors. We find theoretical abundances of approximately 7x10$^5$
parts-per-billion (ppb), which is in agreement with the average observed
abundance in CR2 meteorites of 4$\pm$7x10$^5$, but an order of magnitude higher
than the average observed abundance in CM2 meteorites of 2$\pm$2x10$^4$. We
find that the production of hydroxy acids could be favoured over the production
of amino acids within certain meteorite parent bodies (e.g. CI1, CM2) but not
others (e.g. CR2). This could be due to the relatively lower NH$_3$ abundances
within CI1 and CM2 meteorite parent bodies, which leads to less amino acid
synthesis. We also find that the water content in planetesimals is likely to be
the main cause of variance between carbonaceous chondrites of the same
subclass. We propose that amino acid abundances are primarily dependent on the
ammonia and water content of planetesimals that are formed in chemically
distinct regions within their natal protostellar disks.

thousands of graphical elements at once often results in a cluttered image, and
navigating these elements naively can cause disorientation. To address this
challenge we propose a method called GraphMaps, mimicking the browsing
experience of online geographic maps.
  GraphMaps creates a sequence of layers, where each layer refines the previous
one. During graph browsing, GraphMaps chooses the layer corresponding to the
zoom level, and renders only those entities of the layer that intersect the
current viewport. The result is that, regardless of the graph size, the number
of entities rendered at each view does not exceed a predefined threshold, yet
all graph elements can be explored by the standard zoom and pan operations.
  GraphMaps preprocesses a graph in such a way that during browsing, the
geometry of the entities is stable, and the viewer is responsive. Our case
studies indicate that GraphMaps is useful in gaining an overview of a large

Each of these works analyzed a different model ($JK\Gamma$ versus coupled
zigzag chain model) using a contrasting method (classical versus soft-spin
analysis). The lack of commonality between these works precludes meaningful
comparisons and a proper understanding of these unusual orderings. In this
study, we complete the unfinished picture initiated by these two works by
solving both models with both approaches for both 3D honeycomb iridates.
Through comparisons between all combinations of models, techniques, and

generated by the soft-spin approach with eigenmode mixing irrespective of the

related to both 3D models using the density matrix renormalization group method
to form a benchmark. We discover that in the 1D model, incommensurate

of the system approaches unitarity as the reset frequency of the actuator is
increased. This phenomenon arises because quantum systems interacting for a
short time can impact each other faster than they can become significantly
entangled. In the high reset-frequency limit, the effective Hamiltonian
describing the system's unitary evolution depends on the state to which the
actuator is reset. This makes it possible to indirectly implement a continuous
family of effective Hamiltonians on one part of a bipartite quantum object,
thereby reducing the problem of indirect control (via a quantum actuator) to
the well-studied one of direct quantum control.

can be multiple distinct quantum phases with the same anyons and statistics,
but with different patterns of symmetry fractionalization - termed symmetry
enriched topological (SET) order. When the global symmetry group $G$, which we
take to be discrete, does not change topological superselection sectors - i.e.

imagine a local version of the action of $G$ around each anyon. This leads to
projective representations and a group cohomology description of symmetry
fractionalization, with $H^2(G,{\cal A})$ being the relevant group. In this
paper, we treat the general case of a symmetry group $G$ possibly permuting
anyon types. We show that despite the lack of a local action of $G$, one can
still make sense of a so-called twisted group cohomology description of
symmetry fractionalization, and show how this data is encoded in the
associativity of fusion rules of the extrinsic `twist' defects of the symmetry.
Furthermore, building on work of Hermele, we construct a wide class of exactly

neutral shadow on the planet's nightside. Given an incident ionizing UV flux
comparable to that of the Sun, we find a steady-state mass loss rate of
~$2\times10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$. The total mass loss rate and the outflow
substructure along the substellar ray show good agreement with earlier 1D

coupling involving the states can arise without exponential volume suppression
due to a splitting and joining of the M2-branes. If the fibral curves only sum
to zero in the integral homology of the full fibration, no such coupling is

estimates using all available data from the mid-infrared to the radio suggest
that the redshifts of the two SMGs are $z_{\rm photo} \simeq$ 4-5 and 3,
respectively. Near-infrared objects are found very close to the SMGs and they
are consistent with low-$z$ ellipticals, suggesting that the high apparent
luminosities can be attributed to gravitational magnification. The cumulative
number counts at $S_{\rm 1.1mm} \ge 25$ mJy, combined with other two 1.1-mm
brightest sources, are $0.70 ^{+0.56}_{-0.34}$ deg$^{-2}$, which is consistent
with a model prediction that accounts for flux magnification due to strong
gravitational lensing. Unexpectedly, a $z > 3$ SMG and a Galactic dense
starless core (e.g., a first hydrostatic core) could be similar in the
mid-infrared to millimeter spectral energy distributions and spatial structures
at least at $\gtrsim 1""$. This indicates that it is necessary to distinguish
the two possibilities by means of broad band photometry from the optical to
centimeter and spectroscopy to determine the redshift, when a compact object is

in the hard state at L=2.7e36 erg/s (assuming d=3 kpc) in 2014. The radio
emission is optically thick synchrotron, presumably from a compact jet. We take
advantage of the low extinction and model the near-IR to UV emission with a
multi-temperature disk model. Assuming a BH mass of M_BH=5 Msun and a system
inclination of 40 deg, the fits imply an inner radius for the disk of
Rin/Rg>212 d_3 (5Msun/M_BH). The outer radius is R_out/R_g=90,000 d_3
(5Msun/M_BH), which corresponds to 6.6e10 d_3 cm, consistent with the expected
size of the disk. The 0.5-240 keV spectrum measured by Swift/XRT, Suzaku, and
NuSTAR is relatively well characterized by a power-law with a photon index of
Gamma=1.722+/-0.003, but a significant improvement is seen when a second
continuum component is added. Reflection is a possibility, but no iron line is
detected, implying a low iron abundance. We are able to fit the entire SED with
a multi-temperature disk component, a Comptonization component, and a broken
power-law, representing the emission from the compact jet. The broken power-law
cannot significantly contribute to the soft X-ray emission, and this may be
related to why Swift J1753.5-0127 is an outlier in the radio/X-ray correlation.
The broken power-law might dominate above 20 keV, which would constrain the
break frequency to be between 2.4e10 Hz and 3.6e12 Hz. Although the fits to the
full SED do not include significant thermal emission in the X-ray band,
previous observations have consistently seen such a component, and we find that
there is evidence at the 3.1-sigma level for a disk-blackbody component with a
temperature of 150(+30)(-20) eV and an inner radius of 5-14 R_g. If this
component is real, it might imply the presence of an inner accretion disk in
addition to the strongly truncated (R_in>212 R_g) disk.

telescopes for these two regions. Input parameters of the model, such as
elemental abundances and star formation history, are guided by earlier studies

formation takes place (bursty or continuous) on the line emission. Furthermore,
we tested the effect of adding pressure support with magnetic fields and
turbulence on the line predictions. We find that this model can satisfactorily
predict (within a factor of ~2) all observed lines that originate from the
ionized medium ([SIV] 10.5um, [NeIII] 15.6um, [SIII] 18.7um, [SIII] 33.5um, and

weak pressure support is added to the thermal pressure or when the PDR clouds
are placed farther away from the HII regions and have covering factors lower

stages found in previous studies, with a more evolved, diffuse central region,
and a younger, more compact southern region. However, the local PDR conditions
are averaged out on the 175 pc scales that we probe and do not reflect

environments. In order to do this, we formulate shared control as a random
process and describe the joint distribution that governs its behavior. For
tractability, we model the relationships between the operator, autonomy, and
crowd as an undirected graphical model. Further, we introduce an interaction
function between the operator and the robot, that we call ""agreeability""; in
combination with the methods developed in~\cite{trautman-ijrr-2015}, we extend
a cooperative collision avoidance autonomy to shared control. We therefore
quantify the notion of simultaneously optimizing over agreeability (between the
operator and autonomy), and safety and efficiency in crowded environments. We
show that for a particular form of interaction function between the autonomy
and the operator, linear blending is recovered exactly. Additionally, to
recover linear blending, unimodal restrictions must be placed on the models
describing the operator and the autonomy. In turn, these restrictions raise
questions about the flexibility and applicability of the linear blending
framework. Additionally, we present an extension of linear blending called
""operator biased linear trajectory blending"" (which formalizes some recent

unsuitable for implementation. Instead, we suggest a statistically principled

In contrast to the majority of approaches, our three-field formulation can
fully capture dynamic behavior of porous media even in high frequency loading
phenomena with considerable fluid acceleration such as liquefaction and
biomechanics of porous tissues under rapid external loading. Moreover, we
address the importance of consistent initial conditions for poroelasticity
equations with the incompressibility constraint, which represent a system of
differential algebraic equations. The energy balance equation is derived for
the full porous medium and used to assess the stability and accuracy of our
time integration. To highlight the capabilities of our method, a variety of
numerical studies are provided including verification with analytical and
boundary element solutions, wave propagation analyses, hydraulic conductivity
effects on damping and frequency content, energy balance analyses, mass lumping
considerations, effects of mesh pattern and size, and stability analyses. We
also explain some discrepancies commonly found in dynamic poroelasticity
results in the literature.

recent paper \cite{FIKPPST13} relaxes this definition --- an \itbf{enhanced

suffix) that covers a {\it maximum} number of positions in $x$ (not necessarily
all) --- and proposes efficient algorithms for the computation of enhanced

$x[1..i]$, $1 \le i \le n$. In this paper, we first show how to compute
enhanced covers using instead the \itbf{prefix table}: an array $\pi[1..n]$
such that $\pi[i]$ is the length of the longest substring of $x$ beginning at
position $i$ that matches a prefix of $x$. Unlike the border array, the prefix
table is robust: its properties hold also for \itbf{indeterminate strings} ---
that is, strings defined on {\it subsets} of the alphabet $\Sigma$ rather than
individual elements of $\Sigma$. Thus, our algorithms, in addition to being
faster in practice and more space-efficient than those of \cite{FIKPPST13},
allow us to easily extend the computation of enhanced covers to indeterminate
strings. Both for regular and indeterminate strings, our algorithms execute in
expected linear time. Along the way we establish an important theoretical
result: that the expected maximum length of any border of any prefix of a
regular string $x$ is approximately 1.64 for binary alphabets, less for larger
ones.

find that a combination of geometric constraints with a homophilic attachment

quantum antiferromagnets give strong evidence for the remarkable scenario of
deconfined criticality, but display strong violations of finite-size scaling
that are not yet understood. We show how to realise the universal physics of
the Neel-VBS transition in a 3D classical loop model (this includes the
interference effect that suppresses N\'eel hedgehogs). We use this model to
simulate unprecedentedly large systems (of size $L\leq 512$). Our results are
compatible with a direct continuous transition at which both order parameters
are critical, and we do not see conventional signs of first-order behaviour.
However, we find that the scaling violations are stronger than previously
realised and are incompatible with conventional finite-size scaling over the
size range studied, even if allowance is made for a weakly/marginally
irrelevant scaling variable. In particular, different determinations of the
anomalous dimensions $\eta_\text{VBS}$ and $\eta_\text{N\'eel}$ yield very
different results. The assumption of conventional finite-size scaling gives
estimates which drift to negative values at large $L$, in violation of
unitarity bounds. In contrast, the behaviour of correlators on scales much
smaller than $L$ is consistent with large positive anomalous dimensions.
Barring an unexpected reversal in behaviour at still larger sizes, this implies
that the transition, if continuous, must show unconventional finite-size
scaling, e.g. from a dangerously irrelevant scaling variable. Another
possibility is an anomalously weak first-order transition. By analysing the
renormalisation group flows for the non-compact $CP^{n-1}$ model ($n$-component
Abelian Higgs model) between two and four dimensions, we give the simplest
scenario by which an anomalously weak first-order transition can arise without
fine-tuning of the Hamiltonian.

frequently found to reveal a distinctive high-mass excess near 1Msun. However,
a significant excess of massive white dwarfs has not been detected in the mass
function of the largest white dwarf catalogue to date from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. Hence, whether a high-mass excess exists or not has remained an
open question. In this work we build the mass function of the latest catalogue
of data release 10 SDSS hydrogen-rich white dwarfs, including the cool and
faint population (i.e. effective temperatures 6,000 <~ Teff <~ 12,000 K,
equivalent to 12 mag <~ Mbol <~ 13 mag). We show that the high-mass excess is
clearly present in our mass function, and that it disappears only if the
hottest (brightest) white dwarfs (those with Teff >~ 12,000 K, Mbol <~ 12 mag)
are considered. This naturally explains why previous SDSS mass functions failed
at detecting a significant excess of high-mass white dwarfs. Thus, our results
provide additional and robust observational evidence for the existence of a
distinctive high-mass excess near 1Msun. We investigate possible origins of
this feature and argue that the most plausible scenario that may lead to an
observed excess of massive white dwarfs is the merger of the degenerate core of
a giant star with a main sequence or a white dwarf companion during or shortly
after a common envelope event.

of its properties, from the search of the Higgs boson through its decay into
two photons at the CMS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), on the
full LHC ""Run I"" data collected by the CMS detector during 2011 and 2012,
consisting of proton-proton collision events at $\sqrt{s}$ $=$ $7~\mathrm{TeV}$
with $L$ $=$ $5.1~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ and at $\sqrt{s}$ $=$ $8~\mathrm{TeV}$ with
$L$ $=$ $19.7~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, with the final calibration. In particular, an
excess of events above the background expectation is observed, with a local
significance of 5.7 standard deviations at a mass of 124.7 GeV, which
constitutes the observation of a new particle through the two photon decay
channel. A further measurement provides the precise mass of this new particle
as $124.72_{-0.36}^{+0.35}$ GeV =
124.72$_{-0.32}^{+0.31}$(stat)$_{-0.16}^{+0.16}$(syst) GeV. Its total
production cross section times two photon decay branching ratio relative to
that of the Standard Model Higgs boson is determined as $1.12_{-0.23}^{+0.26}$
= 1.12$_{-0.21}^{+0.21}$(stat)$_{-0.09}^{+0.15}$(syst), compatible with the
Higgs boson expectation. Further extractions of its properties relative to the
Higgs boson, including the production cross section times decay branching
ratios for separate Higgs production processes, couplings to bosons and to
fermions, and effective couplings to the photon and to the gluon, are all
compatible with the expectations for the Standard Model Higgs boson.

variant of Birkhoff averages. The Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem asserts that time
averages of a function evaluated along a trajectory of length $N$ converge to
the space average, the integral of $f$, as $N\to\infty$, for ergodic dynamical
systems. But that convergence can be slow. Instead of uniform averages that
assign equal weights to points along the trajectory, we use an average with a
non-uniform distribution of weights, weighing the early and late points of the
trajectory much less than those near the midpoint $N/2$. We show that in
quasiperiodic dynamical systems, our weighted averages converge far faster
provided $f$ is sufficiently differentiable. This result can be applied to
obtain efficient numerical computation of rotation numbers, invariant densities

chordal graph $G_1$ and a graph $G_2$ with $ccw(G_2)\le {n\over 2}+k$ so that
${\hat G}(k,n)=G_1\cap G_2$. Finally, let ${\hat G}$ be the clique sum graph of

origin. We show that the broad-band data of GRB 080503 can be well explained
within the framework of the double neutron star merger model, provided that the
merger remnant is a rapidly-rotating massive neutron star with an extremely
high magnetic field (i.e. a millisecond magnetar). We show that the late
optical re-brightening is consistent with the emission from a magnetar-powered
""merger-nova"". This adds one more case to the growing sample of merger-novae
associated with short GRBs. The soft extended emission and the late X-ray
excess emission are well connected through a magnetar dipole spin-down
luminosity evolution function, suggesting that direct magnetic dissipation is
the mechanism to produce these X-rays. The X-ray emission initially leaks from
a hole in the merger ejecta pierced by the short GRB jet. The hole subsequently
closes after the magnetar spins down and the magnetic pressure drops below ram
pressure. The X-ray photons are then trapped behind the mergernova ejecta until
the ejecta becomes optically thin at a later time. This explains the
essentially simultaneous re-brightening in both the optical and X-ray
lightcurves. Within this model, future gravitational wave sources could be
associated with a bright X-ray counterpart along with the mergernova, even if
the short GRB jet beams away from Earth.

open problem. For a system of $n$ processes, no algorithm is known that uses a
sublinear number of registers. However, the best known lower bound due to Fich,
Herlihy, and Shavit requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ registers.
  The special symmetric case of the problem where processes are anonymous (run
the same algorithm) has also attracted attention. Even in this case, the best
lower and upper bounds are still $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and $O(n)$. Moreover, Fich,
Herlihy, and Shavit first proved their lower bound for anonymous processes, and
then extended it to the general case. As such, resolving the anonymous case
might be a significant step towards understanding and solving the general

  In this work, we show that in a system of anonymous processes, any consensus
algorithm satisfying nondeterministic solo termination has to use $\Omega(n)$
read-write registers in some execution. This implies an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound

wait-free consensus, matching the upper bound and closing the symmetric case of

numerous authors, the fundamental topological properties of a tree --- namely
acyclicity and connectedness --- can be generalized to arbitrary dimension as
the vanishing of certain cellular homology groups. This point of view is
consistent with the matroid-theoretic approach to graphs, and yields
higher-dimensional analogues of classical enumerative results including
Cayley's formula and the matrix-tree theorem. A subtlety of the
higher-dimensional case is that enumeration must account for the possibility of
torsion homology in trees, which is always trivial for graphs. Cellular trees
are the starting point for further high-dimensional extensions of concepts from
algebraic graph theory including the critical group, cut and flow spaces, and
discrete dynamical systems such as the abelian sandpile model.

and sites of globular clusters (GCs) in a cosmological context. Measuring
directly the mean ages of the metal-poor and metal-rich GC subpopulations in
our own Galaxy, and in other galaxies, is observationally challenging. Here we
apply an alternative approach utilising the property that the galaxy
mass-metallicity relation is a strong function of redshift (or look-back age)
but is relatively insensitive to galaxy mass for massive galaxies. Assuming
that GCs follow galaxy mass-metallicity relations that evolve with redshift,
one can estimate the mean formation epochs of the two GC subpopulations by
knowing their mean metallicities and the growth in host galaxy mass with
redshift. Recently, the SLUGGS survey has measured the spectroscopic
metallicities for over 1000 GCs in a dozen massive early-type galaxies. Here we
use these measurements, and our new metallicity matching method, to infer a
mean age for metal-rich GCs of 11.5 Gyr (z = 2.9) and a range of 12.2 to 12.8
Gyr (4.8 < z < 5.9) for the metal- poor GCs, depending on whether they mostly
formed in accreted satellites or in-situ within the main host galaxy. We
compare our values to direct age measurements for Milky Way GCs and predictions
from cosmological models. Our findings suggest that reionisation preceded most
GC formation, and that it is unlikely to be the cause of GC bimodal metallicity
distributions.

hardware impairments in communication systems. It arises in the analogue parts
of direct conversion radio frequency (RF) transceivers and can cause severe
performance losses. In this paper, I/Q imbalance (IQI) aware widely-linear (WL)
channel estimation and data detection schemes for uplink multi-cell massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are proposed. The resulting
receiver is a WL extension of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver and
jointly mitigates multi-user interference and IQI by processing the real and
the imaginary parts of the received signal separately. The IQI arising at both
the base station (BS) and the user terminals (UTs) is then taken into account.
The considered channel state information (CSI) acquisition model includes the
effects of both estimation errors and pilot contamination, which is caused by
the reuse of the same training sequences in neighboring cells. We apply results
from random matrix theory to derive analytical expressions for the achievable
sum rates of the proposed IQI aware and conventional IQI unaware receivers. Our
simulation results show that the performance of the proposed IQI aware WLMMSE
receiver in a system with IQI is close to that of the MMSE receiver in an ideal
system without IQI. Moreover, our results for the sum rate of the IQI unaware
MMSE receiver reveal that the performance loss due to IQI can be large and, if
left unattended, does not vanish for large numbers of BS antennas.

recognition and classification problems in computer vision, but their use in
graphics problems has been limited. In this work, we present a novel deep
architecture that performs new view synthesis directly from pixels, trained
from a large number of posed image sets. In contrast to traditional approaches
which consist of multiple complex stages of processing, each of which require
careful tuning and can fail in unexpected ways, our system is trained
end-to-end. The pixels from neighboring views of a scene are presented to the
network which then directly produces the pixels of the unseen view. The
benefits of our approach include generality (we only require posed image sets
and can easily apply our method to different domains), and high quality results
on traditionally difficult scenes. We believe this is due to the end-to-end
nature of our system which is able to plausibly generate pixels according to
color, depth, and texture priors learnt automatically from the training data.
To verify our method we show that it can convincingly reproduce known test
views from nearby imagery. Additionally we show images rendered from novel
viewpoints. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep learning to
the problem of new view synthesis from sets of real-world, natural imagery.

quantum optics and its applications. Despite its conceptual simplicity it
entails a wide range of intriguing phenomena, such as the Mollow-triplet
emission spectrum and coherent photon emission. One fundamental aspect of
resonance fluorescence, reduced quantum fluctuations in the single photon
stream from an atom in free space, was predicted more than 30 years ago.
However, the requirement to operate in the weak excitation regime, together
with the combination of modest oscillator strength of atoms and low collection
efficiencies, has continued to cast stringent experimental conditions for the
observation of squeezing with atoms. Attempts to circumvent these issues had to
sacrifice antibunching due to either stimulated forward scattering from atomic
ensembles or multiphoton transitions inside optical cavities. Here, we use an
artificial atom with a large optical dipole enabling 100-fold improvement of
the photon detection rate over the natural atom counterpart and reach the
necessary conditions for the observation of quadrature squeezing in single
resonance-fluorescence photons. Implementing phase-dependent homodyne
intensity-correlation detection, we demonstrate that the electric field
quadrature variance of resonance fluorescence is 3\% below the fundamental
limit set by vacuum fluctuations, while the photon statistics remain
antibunched. The presence of squeezing and antibunching simultaneously is a
fully nonclassical outcome of the wave-particle duality of photons.

or smaller than 3 quintuple layers (QL), a spatially inhomogeneous surface
spectral gap \Delta opens up below T_c^{2D}, which is much higher than the bulk
Curie temperature T_c^{3D}. The mean value and spatial homogeneity of the gap
\Delta generally increase with increasing c-axis magnetic field (H) and
increasing Cr doping level (x), suggesting that the physical origin of this
surface gap is associated with proximity-induced c-axis ferromagnetism. On the
other hand, the temperature (T) dependence of \Delta is non-monotonic, showing
an initial increase below T_c^{2D} followed by a dip and then reaching maximum
at T << T_c^{3D}. These phenomena may be attributed to proximity magnetism
induced by two types of contributions with different temperature dependence: a
3D contribution from the bulk magnetism that dominates at low T, and a 2D
contribution associated with the RKKY interactions mediated by surface Dirac
fermions, which dominates at T_c^{3D} << T < T_c^{2D}. Additionally, spatially
localized sharp resonant spectra are found along the boundaries of gapped and
gapless regions. These spectral resonances are long-lived at H = 0 and become
suppressed under strong c-axis magnetic fields, and are attributed to magnetic
impurity-induced topological defects in the spin texture of surface Dirac

simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a promising
technique in energy-constrained wireless networks. While most existing work on
SWIPT focuses on capacity-energy characterization, the benefits of cooperative
transmission for SWIPT are much less investigated. In this paper, we consider
SWIPT in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) relaying system,
where a source node transfers information and a fraction of power
simultaneously to a relay node, and the relay node uses the harvested power
from the source node to forward the source information to the destination. To
support the simultaneous information and energy cooperation, we first propose a
transmission protocol assuming that the direct link between the source and
destination does not exist, namely power splitting (PS) relaying protocol,
where the relay node splits the received signal power in the first hop into two
separate parts, one for information decoding and the other for energy
harvesting. Then, we consider the case that the direct link between the source
and destination is available, and the transmission mode adaptation (TMA)
protocol is proposed, where the transmission can be completed by cooperative
mode and direct mode simultaneously (over different subcarriers). In direct
mode, when the source transmits signal to the destination, the destination
receives the signal as information and the relay node concurrently receives the
signal for energy harvesting. Joint resource allocation problems are formulated
to maximize the system throughput. By using the Lagrangian dual method, we
develop efficient algorithms to solve the nonconvex optimization problems.

on the effects of substrate roughness, parameterized by the dimensionless

energy cost of elastic deformation and gain in surface energy induces a
parallel-to-perpendicular transition of the BCP lamellae. Employing
self-consistent field theory (SCFT), we study the critical substrate roughness
value corresponding to this transition. The critical value increases as
function of the surface preference towards one of the two BCP components, and
as function of film thickness. But, it decreases with increasing values of the
Flory-Huggins parameter. Our findings are equivalent to stating that the
critical value decreases as the BCP molecular weight or the natural BCP
periodicity increases. We further show that the rough substrate can overcome
the formation of parallel lamellae in cases where the top surface has a
preference towards one of the two BCP components. Our results are in good
agreement with previous experiments, and highlight the physical conditions
behind the perpendicular orientation of lamellar phases, as is desired in
nanolithography and other industrial applications.

are accreting. Statistically distinct variability properties are observed for
accreting and non-accreting cluster members. The accretors exhibit a
significantly higher level of variability than the non-accretors, especially in
the UV. The amount of u-band variability correlates statistically with UV
excess in disk-bearing objects, which suggests that accretion and star-disk
interaction are the main sources of variability. Cool magnetic spots, several
hundred degrees colder than the photosphere and covering from 5 to 30% of the
stellar surface, appear to be the leading factor of variability for the
non-accreting stars. In contrast, accretion spots, a few thousand degrees
hotter than the photosphere and covering a few percent of the stellar surface,
best reproduce the variability of accreting objects. The color behavior is also
found to be different between accreting and non-accreting stars. Typical
variability amplitudes for accreting members rapidly increase from r to u,
which indicates a much stronger contrast at short wavelengths; a lower color
dependence in the amplitudes is instead measured for diskless stars. We find
that u-band variability on hour timescales is typically about 10% of the
peak-to-peak variability on day timescales, while longer term (years)
variability is consistent with amplitudes measured over weeks. We conclude that
for both accreting and non-accreting stars, the mid-term rotational modulation
by spots is the leading timescale for a variability of up to several years. In
turn, this suggests that the accretion process is essentially stable over
years, although it exhibits low-level shorter term variations in single
accretion events.

populations: purely rocky bodies whose atmospheres contribute negligibly to
their sizes, and larger gas-enveloped planets possessing voluminous and
optically thick atmospheres. We show that whether a planet forms rocky or
gas-enveloped depends on the solid surface density of its parent disk. Assembly
times for rocky cores are sensitive to disk solid surface density. Lower
surface densities spawn smaller planetary embryos; to assemble a core of given
mass, smaller embryos require more mergers between bodies farther apart and
therefore exponentially longer formation times. Gas accretion simulations yield
a rule of thumb that a rocky core must be at least 2$M_\oplus$ before it can
acquire a volumetrically significant atmosphere from its parent nebula. In
disks of low solid surface density, cores of such mass appear only after the
gas disk has dissipated, and so remain purely rocky. Higher surface density
disks breed massive cores more quickly, within the gas disk lifetime, and so
produce gas-enveloped planets. We test model predictions against observations,
using planet radius as an observational proxy for gas-to-rock content and host
star metallicity as a proxy for disk solid surface density. Theory can explain
the observation that metal-rich stars host predominantly gas-enveloped planets.

to discover the underlying data relationship in exploratory studies, such as

discriminative. This may cause the ignorance of subtle but critical network
changes that are of investigation values across populations. In this paper, we
propose to improve the discriminative power of BN models for continuous
variables from two different perspectives. This brings two general
discriminative learning frameworks for Gaussian Bayesian networks (GBN). In the
first framework, we employ Fisher kernel to bridge the generative models of GBN
and the discriminative classifiers of SVMs, and convert the GBN parameter
learning to Fisher kernel learning via minimizing a generalization error bound
of SVMs. In the second framework, we employ the max-margin criterion and build
it directly upon GBN models to explicitly optimize the classification
performance of the GBNs. The advantages and disadvantages of the two frameworks
are discussed and experimentally compared. Both of them demonstrate strong
power in learning discriminative parameters of GBNs for neuroimaging based
brain network analysis, as well as maintaining reasonable representation
capacity. The contributions of this paper also include a new Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) constraint with theoretical guarantee to ensure the graph validity

before vanishing at the critical point. The fluctuation regime, i.e. the way
the ordered phase disappears, is a characteristics of a transition, and
determines the universality class it belongs to. This is valid for thermal
transitions, but also for zero temperature Quantum Phase Transitions (QPT).
  In the case of superconductivity, the order parameter has an amplitude and a
phase, which can both fluctuate according to well identified scenarios. The
Ginzburg-Landau theory and its extensions describe the fluctuating regime of
regular metallic superconductors, and the associated dynamics of the pair
amplitude and the phase. When the system is two-dimensional and/or very
disordered, phase fluctuations dominate.
  Here, we address the possibility that a new type of fluctuations occurs in
superconductors with an anomalous dynamics. In particular we show that the
superconducting to metal QPT that occurs upon changing the gate voltage in
two-dimensional electron gases at LAO/STO and LTO/STO interfaces displays
anomalous scaling properties, which can be explained by density driven
superconducting critical fluctuations.
  A Finite Size Scaling (FSS) analysis reveals that the product z.nu (nu is the
correlation length exponent and z the dynamical critical one) is z.nu = 3/2. We
argue that critical superconducting fluctuations acquire an anomalous dynamics
with z=3, since they couple to density ones in the vicinity of a spontaneous
electronic phase separation, and that nu=1/2 corresponds to the mean-field
value. This approach strongly departs from the conventional z=1 scenario in
disordered 2D systems based on long-range Coulomb interactions with dominant
phase fluctuations. This scenario can explain recent data in LSCO ultra-thin
films, and apply to a whole class of two-dimensional superconductors.

heavy-ion collisions result either in fusion or in quasifission. The former
produces a compound nucleus in statistical equilibrium, while the second leads
to a reseparation of the fragments after partial mass equilibration without
formation of a compound nucleus. Extracting the compound nucleus formation
probability is crucial to predict superheavy-element formation cross-sections.
It requires a good knowledge of the fragment angular distribution which itself
depends on quantities such as moments of inertia and excitation energies which
have so far been somewhat arbitrary for the quasifission contribution.
  Methods: We investigate the evolution of the nuclear density in
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations leading to quasifission. Our
main goal is to extract ingredients of the formula used in the analysis of
experimental angular distributions. These include the moment-of-inertia and
temperature. We study the dependence of these quantities on various initial
conditions of the reaction process.
  Results: The evolution of the moment of inertia is clearly non-trivial and
depends strongly on the characteristics of the collision. The temperature rises
quickly when the kinetic energy is transformed into internal excitation. Then,
it rises slowly during mass transfer.
  Conclusions: Fully microscopic theories are useful to predict the complex
evolution of quantities required in macroscopic models of quasifission.

Synergetic sociAL Scene Analysis, and make two main contributions to research
on automated social interaction analysis: (1) SALSA records social interactions
among 18 participants in a natural, indoor environment for over 60 minutes,
under the poster presentation and cocktail party contexts presenting
difficulties in the form of low-resolution images, lighting variations,
numerous occlusions, reverberations and interfering sound sources; (2) To
alleviate these problems we facilitate multimodal analysis by recording the
social interplay using four static surveillance cameras and sociometric badges
worn by each participant, comprising the microphone, accelerometer, bluetooth
and infrared sensors. In addition to raw data, we also provide annotations
concerning individuals' personality as well as their position, head, body
orientation and F-formation information over the entire event duration. Through
extensive experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, we show (a) the
limitations of current methods and (b) how the recorded multiple cues
synergetically aid automatic analysis of social interactions. SALSA is

random phase delay acquired while crossing a scattering curtain. The technique
is commonly exploited in many fields, including astrophysics, microscopy,
biomedicine and biology. A turbid lens has the capability of producing foci
with a resolution higher than conventional optics, however it has a fundamental
limit: to obtain a sharp focus one has to introduce a strongly scattering
medium in the optical path. Indeed a tight focusing needs strong scattering
and, as a consequence, high resolution focusing is obtained only for weakly
transmitting samples. Here we disclose an unprecedented phenomenon which allows
to obtain highly concentrated optical spots even by introducing a minimum
amount of scattering in the beam path that is with semi-transparent materials.
By filtering the pseudo-ballistic components of the transmitted beam we are
able to experimentally overcome the limits of the adaptive focus resolution,
gathering light on a spot with a diameter which is one third of the original

identical massive bosons and the relationship to spin squeezing and other

systems where the probabilities for joint measurements on the composite
sub-systems are no longer determined from measurement probabilities on the
separate sub-systems. We focus on the meaning of entanglement, the quantum
paradoxes associated with entangled states, and important tests that allow an
experimentalist to determine whether a quantum state - in particular, one for
massive bosons is entangled. Our tests for entanglement fully utilise the
symmetrisation principle and super-selection rules for bosonic massive
particles. These papers provides detailed arguments necessary for the
conclusions of a recent paper which presented results for rigorously
demonstrating the entanglement of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).
  In the first paper (I), we discuss the meaning of entanglement for systems of
identical particles. For such systems, the relevant quantum density operators
must satisfy the symmetrisation principle and global and local super-selection
rules prohibiting states in which there are coherences between differing
particle numbers. We fully justify these requirements. In the second
quantisation approach, both the system and sub-systems are modes (or sets of
modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different mode
occupancies.
  In the accompanying review paper (II), we consider spin squeezing and other
tests for entanglement for two-mode bosonic systems. Starting from paper (I) we
determine which tests are useful for detecting entanglement in massive bosonic
(BEC), as opposed to photonic, systems. Several new inequalities are derived,
and recent key experiments are analysed.

algebra, a basis of bispectral multivariable $q-$orthogonal polynomials is
exhibited. In a first part, it is shown that the multivariable Askey-Wilson
polynomials with $N$ variables and $N+3$ parameters introduced by Gasper and
Rahman [1] generate a family of infinite dimensional modules for the
$q-$Onsager algebra, whose fundamental generators are realized in terms of the
multivariable $q-$difference and difference operators proposed by Iliev [2].
Raising and lowering operators extending those of Sahi [3] are also
constructed. In a second part, finite dimensional modules are constructed and
studied for a certain class of parameters and if the $N$ variables belong to a
discrete support. In this case, the bispectral property finds a natural
interpretation within the framework of tridiagonal pairs. In a third part,
eigenfunctions of the $q-$Dolan-Grady hierarchy are considered in the
polynomial basis. In particular, invariant subspaces are identified for certain
conditions generalizing Nepomechie's relations. In a fourth part, the analysis
is extended to the special case $q=1$. This framework provides a
$q-$hypergeometric formulation of quantum integrable models such as the open
XXZ spin chain with generic integrable boundary conditions ($q\neq 1$).

i.e., retrieving instances from gallery which are generated by the same person
as the given probe image. This is very challenging because the person's
appearance usually undergoes significant variations due to changes in
illumination, camera angle and view, background clutter, and occlusion over the
camera network. In this paper, we assume that the matched gallery images should
not only be similar to the probe, but also be similar to each other, under
suitable metric. We express this assumption with a fully connected CRF model in
which each node corresponds to a gallery and every pair of nodes are connected
by an edge. A label variable is associated with each node to indicate whether
the corresponding image is from target person. We define unary potential for
each node using existing feature calculation and matching techniques, which
reflect the similarity between probe and gallery image, and define pairwise
potential for each edge in terms of a weighed combination of Gaussian kernels,
which encode appearance similarity between pair of gallery images. The specific
form of pairwise potential allows us to exploit an efficient inference
algorithm to calculate the marginal distribution of each label variable for
this dense connected CRF. We show the superiority of our method by applying it
to public datasets and comparing with the state of the art.

identical massive bosons and the relationship to spin squeezing and other
quantum correlation effects. Entanglement is a key quantum feature of composite
systems where the probabilities for joint measurements on the composite
sub-systems are no longer determined from measurement probabilities on the
separate sub-systems. We focus on the meaning of entanglement, the quantum
paradoxes associated with entangled states, and important tests that allow an
experimentalist to determine whether a quantum state - in particular, one for
massive bosons is entangled. Our tests for entanglement fully utilise the
symmetrisation principle and super-selection rules for bosonic massive
particles. These papers provides detailed arguments necessary for the
conclusions of a recent paper which presented results for rigorously
demonstrating the entanglement of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).
  In the first paper (I), we discuss the meaning of entanglement for systems of
identical particles. For such systems, the relevant quantum density operators
must satisfy the symmetrisation principle and global and local super-selection
rules prohibiting states in which there are coherences between differing
particle numbers. We fully justify these requirements. In the second
quantisation approach, both the system and sub-systems are modes (or sets of
modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different mode
occupancies.
  In the accompanying review paper (II), we consider spin squeezing and other
tests for entanglement for two-mode bosonic systems. Starting from paper (I) we
determine which tests are useful for detecting entanglement in massive bosonic
(BEC), as opposed to photonic, systems. Several new inequalities are derived,
and recent key experiments are analysed.

time-reversal symmetry is present, equal and opposite amounts of k-space Berry
curvature accumulate in each of the two valleys. This is conveniently
quantified by the integral of the Berry curvature over a single valley - the
valley Hall conductivity. We generalize this definition to include
contributions from disorder described with the supercell approach, by mapping
(""unfolding"") the Berry curvature from the folded Brillouin zone of the
disordered supercell onto the normal Brillouin zone of the pristine crystal,
and then averaging over several realizations of disorder. We use this scheme to
study from first-principles the effect of sulfur vacancies on the valley Hall
conductivity of monolayer MoS2. In dirty samples the intrinsic valley Hall
conductivity receives gating-dependent corrections that are only weakly
dependent on the impurity concentration, consistent with side-jump scattering
and the unfolded Berry curvature can be interpreted as a k-space resolved

a divergent valley Hall conductivity in the clean limit. The implications for

of a SLOCC transformation shows up quite naturally as a one relating the CC and
CI expansions, and going from the CI expansion to the CC one is equivalent to
obtaining a form for the state where the structure of the entanglement classes
is transparent. In this picture entanglement is characterized by the parameters
of the cluster operators describing transitions from occupied states to
singles, doubles and triples of non occupied ones. Using the CC parametrization
of states in the seven mode case we give a simple formula for the unique SLOCC
invariant $\mathcal{J}$. Then we consider a perturbation problem featuring a
state from the unique SLOCC class characterized by $\mathcal{J}\neq 0$. For
this state with entanglement generated by doubles we investigate the phenomenon
of changing the entanglement type due to the perturbing effect of triples. We
show that there are states with real amplitudes such that their entanglement
encoded into configurations of clusters of doubles is protected from errors
generated by triples. Finally we put forward a proposal to use the parameters
of the cluster operator describing transitions to doubles for entanglement
characterization. Compared to the usual SLOCC classes this provides a coarse

scintillation-noise approximation used by many astronomers tends to
underestimate the median scintillation noise at several major observatories
around the world. We show that using median atmospheric optical turbulence
profiles, which are now available for most sites, provides a better estimate of
the expected scintillation noise and that real-time turbulence profiles can be
used to precisely characterise the scintillation noise component of
contemporaneous photometric measurements. This will enable a better
understanding and calibration of photometric noise sources and the
effectiveness of scintillation correction techniques. We also provide new
equations for calculating scintillation noise, including for extremely large
telescopes where the scintillation noise will actually be lower than previously
thought. These equations highlight the fact that scintillation noise and shot
noise have the same dependence on exposure time and so if an observation is
scintillation limited, it will be scintillation limited for all exposure times.
The ratio of scintillation noise to shot noise is also only weakly dependent on
telescope diameter and so a bigger telescope may not yield a reduction in
fractional scintillation noise.

be about 87 keV (FWHM), which is better than the result of the traditional

Over this time period, we find an exponential growth both in the number of

use modeling assumptions of how newly entering developers choose to either
found a new project or to join existing ones. Our model applies only to
collaborative projects that are deemed to grow in size by attracting new
developers. We verify, by a thorough statistical analysis, that the Yule-Simon

projects except for certain time periods where the modeling assumptions no
longer hold. We detect and empirically test the reason for this limitation,

interactions. In equilibrium, limited specificity may lead to crosstalk: a
regulatory state in which a gene is either incorrectly activated due to
noncognate TF-DNA interactions or remains erroneously inactive. We present a
tractable biophysical model of global crosstalk, where many genes are
simultaneously regulated by many TFs. We show that in the simplest regulatory
scenario, a lower bound on crosstalk severity can be analytically derived
solely from the number of (co)regulated genes and a suitable parameter that
describes binding site similarity. Estimates show that crosstalk could present
a significant challenge for organisms with low-specificity TFs, such as
metazoans, unless they use appropriate regulation schemes. Strong cooperativity
substantially decreases crosstalk, while joint regulation by activators and
repressors, surprisingly, does not; moreover, certain microscopic details about
promoter architecture emerge as globally important determinants of crosstalk
strength. Our results suggest that crosstalk imposes a new type of global
constraint on the functioning and evolution of regulatory networks, which is
qualitatively distinct from the known constraints acting at the level of
individual gene regulatory elements.

problem: it is a result of the accidental dark baryon number conservation. And
with an analogy to QCD, all physical quantities of the dark matter can be
calculated by rescaling the QCD experimental results. According to the thermal
freeze-out mechanism the mass of the dark matter is predicted to be
$\mathcal{O}(100)$~TeV in order to achieve a correct relic abundance. Such

necessarily strictly preserved thanks to operators suppressed by the Planck

current detection bound. We show our model with $\mathcal{O}(10^{27})~s$ dark

experimentally interpreted as an access, although some theoretical uncertainty
may weaken its significance. We also investigate other phenomena of this model

expression profiles of thousands of genes in the mouse brain, co-registered to
a common three-dimensional template (the Allen Reference Atlas). This
brain-wide, genome-wide data set has triggered a renaissance in neuroanatomy.
Its voxelized version (with cubic voxels of side 200 microns) can be analyzed
on a desktop computer using MATLAB. On the other hand, brain cells exhibit a
great phenotypic diversity (in terms of size, shape and electrophysiological
activity), which has inspired the names of some well-studied cell types, such
as granule cells and medium spiny neurons. However, no exhaustive taxonomy of
brain cells is available. A genetic classification of brain cells is under way,
and some cell types have been characterized by their transcriptome profiles.
However, given a cell type characterized by its transcriptome, it is not clear
where else in the brain similar cells can be found. The ABA can been used to
solve this region-specificity problem in a data-driven way: rewriting the
brain-wide expression profiles of all genes in the atlas as a sum of
cell-type-specific transcriptome profiles is equivalent to solving a quadratic
optimization problem at each voxel in the brain. However, the estimated
brain-wide densities of 64 cell types published recently were based on one
series of co-registered coronal in situ hybridization (ISH) images per gene,
whereas the online ABA contains several image series per gene, including
sagittal ones. In the presented work, we simulate the variability of cell-type
densities in a Monte Carlo way by repeatedly drawing a random image series for
each gene and solving optimization problems. This yields error bars on the
region-specificity of cell types.

range around 20 MeV is troublesome when it comes to the cross sections used by

above, where they are based on semi-empirical models. Several customisations

Production process is a t-channel single top event with charged Higgs exchange.
Therefore the signal is similar with Standard Model single top production in

calculated and compared to the other main production processes which are used
for a heavy charged Higgs search at LHC, i.e., pp -> tbH- and pp -> H+ -> tb.
In the next step, an event generation and analysis is applied on signal and
background events, in order to estimate the signal significance. The signal
cross section is typically smaller than the associated production (tbH-) and
resonance production (tb) by a factor of 10-3 and ranges from 10 fb to 1 fb for
charged Higgs mass from 200 to 500 GeV at tanbeta = 50. Due to the small cross
section of signal events and large SM background, the signal significance is
small even after a dedicated kinematic analysis and selection of events,

interest. Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used
in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this
paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning.
This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning
algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering
the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most
existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not
evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended
to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at
inferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph
and, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources
of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or
globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be
relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or
graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full
graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural
tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than
clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real
networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the
original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing
interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling
and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific
fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe
pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are
used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples
include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been
considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In

interacting species is at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to
withstand small perturbations to component species' abundances without
suffering adverse effects. In ecology, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at an
equilibrium point is known as the community matrix, which describes the
population dynamics of interacting species. A system's asymptotic short- and
long-term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the
community matrix. Here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to
describe intermediate, transient dynamics. We first recover the established
result that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region
of `transient instability', where the effect of a small perturbation to
species' abundances---to the population vector---is amplified before ultimately
decaying. Then we show that the shift from stability to transient instability
can be affected by uncertainty in, or small changes to, entries in the
community matrix, and determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude
of perturbations to the population vector. Of five different types of community
matrix, we find that amplification is least severe when predator-prey
interactions dominate. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose
dynamics can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian matrix. Our results will
lead to improved understanding of how multiple perturbations to a complex
system may irrecoverably break stability.

to a general class of hyperbolic free group extensions. Let $F_N$ denote a free
groups of finite rank $N\ge 3$ and consider a \emph{convex cocompact} subgroup
$\Gamma\le Out(F_N)$, i.e. one for which the orbit map from $\Gamma$ into the
free factor complex of $F_N$ is a quasi-isometric embedding. The subgroup
$\Gamma$ determines an extension $E_\Gamma$ of $F_N$, and the main theorem of
Dowdall--Taylor \cite{DT1} states that in this situation $E_\Gamma$ is
hyperbolic if and only if $\Gamma$ is purely atoroidal.
  Here, we give an explicit geometric description of the Cannon--Thurston maps
$\partial F_N\to\partial E_\Gamma$ for these hyperbolic free group extensions,
the existence of which follows from a general result of Mitra. In particular,
we obtain a uniform bound on the multiplicity of the Cannon--Thurston map,
showing that this map has multiplicity at most $2N$. This theorem generalizes
the main result of Kapovich and Lustig \cite{KapLusCT} which treats the special
case where $\Gamma$ is infinite cyclic. We also answer a question of Mahan
Mitra by producing an explicit example of a hyperbolic free group extension for
which the natural map from the boundary of $\Gamma$ to the space of laminations
of the free group (with the Chabauty topology) is not continuous.

classification problem follow the same distribution as observed training data.
However, this principle can break down when machine learning is used to make
important decisions about the welfare (employment, education, health) of
strategic individuals. Knowing information about the classifier, such
individuals may manipulate their attributes in order to obtain a better
classification outcome. As a result of this behavior---often referred to as
gaming---the performance of the classifier may deteriorate sharply. Indeed,
gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning methods in practice;
in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known as Goodhart's law. In
this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms for learning
classifiers that are robust to gaming.
  We model classification as a sequential game between a player named ""Jury""
and a player named ""Contestant."" Jury designs a classifier, and Contestant
receives an input to the classifier, which he may change at some cost. Jury's
goal is to achieve high classification accuracy with respect to Contestant's
original input and some underlying target classification function. Contestant's
goal is to achieve a favorable classification outcome while taking into account
the cost of achieving it.
  For a natural class of cost functions, we obtain computationally efficient
learning algorithms which are near-optimal. Surprisingly, our algorithms are
efficient even on concept classes that are computationally hard to learn. For
general cost functions, designing an approximately optimal strategy-proof
classifier, for inverse-polynomial approximation, is NP-hard.

handle them to achieve a sufficient level of security for any given system.
However, most of these systems have not been designed with focus on good
usability for the average end user. Today, the average end user often struggles
with understanding and using security mecha-nisms. Other security mechanisms
are simply annoying for end users. As the overall security of any system is
only as strong as the weakest link in this system, bad usability of IT security
mechanisms may result in operating errors, resulting in inse-cure systems.
Buying decisions of end users may be affected by the usability of security
mechanisms. Hence, software provid-ers may decide to better have no security
mechanism then one with a bad usability. Usability of IT security mechanisms is
one of the most underestimated properties of applications and sys-tems. Even IT
security itself is often only an afterthought. Hence, usability of security
mechanisms is often the after-thought of an afterthought. This paper presents
some guide-lines that should help software developers to improve end user
usability of security-related mechanisms, and analyzes com-mon applications
based on these guidelines. Based on these guidelines, the usability of email
encryption is analyzed and an email encryption solution with increased
usability is presented. The approach is based on an automated key and trust
man-agement. The compliance of the proposed email encryption solution with the
presented guidelines for usable security mechanisms is evaluated.

We do not know what the minimum amount of information for self-replication is

which this likelihood can be enhanced. Here we present evidence from numerical

at small temperature $T\ll T_N$, where $T_N$ is the Neel temperature. Similar
to 3D and 2D ferromagnets, quantum and thermal fluctuations renormalize greatly
the bare gapless spectrum leading to a gap $\Delta\sim \omega_0$, where
$\omega_0$ is the characteristic dipolar energy. This gap is accompanied by
anisotropic corrections to the free energy which make the cube edges easy

with previous results, we find that dipolar forces split the magnon spectrum
into two branches. This splitting makes possible two types of processes which
lead to a considerable enhance of the damping compared to the Heisenberg AF: a
magnon decay into two other magnons and a confluence of two magnons. It is
found that magnons are well defined quasiparticles in quantum AF. We
demonstrate however that a small fraction of long-wavelength magnons can be
overdamped in AFs with $S\gg1$ and in quantum AFs with a single-ion anisotropy
competing with the dipolar anisotropy. Particular materials are pointed out
which can be suitable for experimental observation of this long-wavelength

success rate of this kind of advertisement is rather low, however, as sending

in enough revenue such that this kind of advertisement pays off. The anti-spam

are advertised by spam emails and on lowering the revenues from spam. Costs can
be increased for a website by increasing traffic. Revenues can be decreased by
making the website slow responding, hence some business gets lost. To increase
costs and decreased revenues a decentralized peer-to-peer coordination
mechanism is used to have mail clients to agree on a start date and time for an
anti-spam campaign. During a campaign, all clients that received spam emails
advertings a website send an opt-out request to this website. A huge number of
opt-out requests results in increased traffic to this website and will likely
result in a slower responsibility of the website. The coordination mechanism
presented in this paper is based on a peer-to-peer mechanisms and a so-called
paranoid trust model to avoid manipulation by spammers. An implementation for
the Thunderbird email client exist. The anti-spam approach presented in this

Due to its importance, it is reanalyzed here. In the present contribution a

extended to any number of clusters, though in this contribution we discuss only
two-cluster systems, for illustrative reasons. A simple rule is obtained for
the minimization of the forbiddenness, namely to start from a cluster system

the two and half-dimensional (2.5-D) ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations
to study the evolution of Alfv\'en waves and vertical flows forming the plasma

red-shifted velocity component of Fe XII 195.12 \AA\ line attains its maximum
($5~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$) which converts into a blue-shifted one between the
altitude of $5-10~\mathrm{Mm}$. The spectral intensity continously increases up
to $10~\mathrm{Mm}$, while FWHM still exhibits the low values with almost
constant trend. This indicates that the reconnection point within the jet's
magnetic field topology lies in the corona $5-10~\mathrm{Mm}$ from its
footpoint anchored in the Sun's surface. Beyond this height, FWHM shows a
growing trend. This may be the signature of Alfv\'en waves that impulsively
evolve due to reconnection and propagate along the jet. From our numerical
data, we evaluate space- and time- averaged Alfv\'en waves velocity amplitudes
at different heights in the jet's current-sheet, which contribute to the
non-thermal motions and spectral line broadening. The synthetic width of Fe XII
$195.12~\mathrm{\AA}$ line exhibits similar trend of increment as in the
observational data, possibly proving the existence of impulsively generated (by
reconnection) Alfv\'en waves which propagate along the jet.

further mechanisms rely on identities, e.g., whitelists defining allowed

basic building block for the protection of communication. However, providing
trusted identities in a practical way is still a difficult problem and too

be based on the ubiquitous availability of trusted identities. This paper
describes how identity cards can be integrated within three domains: home
energy management, vehicle-2-grid communication, and SIP-based voice over IP
telephony. In all three domains, identity cards are used to reliably identify

spectral energy distribution (SED) per unit extinction in the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM). We use our results to constrain the variability of
the optical properties of big grains in the diffuse ISM, as published by the
Planck collaboration.
  We use two different techniques to compare the predictions of dust models to
data from the Planck HFI, IRAS and SDSS surveys. First, we fit the far-infrared
emission spectrum to recover the dust extinction and the intensity of the
interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Second, we infer the ISRF intensity from
the total power emitted by dust per unit extinction, and then predict the
emission spectrum. In both cases, we test the ability of the models to
reproduce dust emission and extinction at the same time.
  We identify two issues. Not all models can reproduce the average dust
emission per unit extinction: there are differences of up to a factor $\sim2$
between models, and the best accord between model and observation is obtained
with the more emissive grains derived from recent laboratory data on silicates
and amorphous carbons. All models fail to reproduce the variations in the
emission per unit extinction if the only variable parameter is the ISRF
intensity: this confirms that the optical properties of dust are indeed
variable in the diffuse ISM.
  Diffuse ISM observations are consistent with a scenario where both ISRF
intensity and dust optical properties vary. The ratio of the far-infrared
opacity to the $V$ band extinction cross-section presents variations of the
order of $\sim20\%$ ($40-50\%$ in extreme cases), while ISRF intensity varies
by $\sim30\%$ ($\sim60\%$ in extreme cases). This must be accounted for in
future modelling.

However, real applications use all resource types to varying degrees. The

finite element modeling of complete heart valves has greatly aided evaluation

understanding of healthy and abnormal cardiac function. Such a model must be
based on an accurate description of the mechanical behavior of the valve
material. It is essential to calculate velocity/displacement and strain
rate/strain at a component level that is to work at the cellular level. In this
study we developed the first three-dimensional displacement vectors field in
the characterization of mitral valve leaflets in continuum equations of

  Method: Much of our knowledge of abnormal mitral valve function is based on
surgical and post-mortem studies while these studies are quantitative in some
cases, they are limited by evaluation of valve anatomy in a fixed and
nonfunctioning state. A more sophisticated analysis method is necessary to gain
a full considerate of mitral valve function. Several groups attempted to model
mitral valve anatomy and function by mathematical/physical equations.

raises questions regarding their formation and dynamical evolution. Recent
discoveries of circumbinary planets by the Kepler space telescope has shown
that some of these planets reside close to the dynamical stability limit where
it is very difficult to form planets in situ. For binary systems with nearly
circular orbits, such as Kepler-38, the observed proximity of planetary orbits
to the stability limit can be understood by an evolutionary process in which
planets form farther out in the disk and migrate inward to their observed
position. The Kepler-34 system has a high orbital eccentricity of 0.52. Here,
we analyse evolutionary scenarios for the planet observed around this system
using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations.
  The highly eccentric binary opens a wide inner hole in the disk which is also
eccentric, and displays a slow prograde precession. As a result of the large,
eccentric inner gap, an embedded planet settles in a final equilibrium position
that lies beyond the observed location of Kepler-34 b, but has the correct
eccentricity. In this configuration the planetary orbit is aligned with the
disk in a state of apsidal corotation.To account for the closer orbit of
Kepler-34 b to the central binary, we considered a two-planet scenario and
examined the evolution of the system through joint inward migration and capture
into mean-motion resonances. When the inner planet orbits inside the gap of the
disk, planet-planet scattering ensues. While often one object is thrown into a
large, highly eccentric orbit, at times the system is left with a planet close
to the observed orbit, suggesting that Kepler 34 might have had two
circumbinary planets where one might have been scattered out of the system or
into an orbit where it did not transit the central binary during the operation
of Kepler.

allow to implement this concept to achieve novel magnetic properties. Here, we
have designed a family of Heusler alloys with a compensated ferrimagnetic

exchange bias (EB) of more than 3 T and a similarly large coercivity are
established. The large exchange anisotropy originates from the exchange
interaction between the compensated host and ferrimagnetic clusters that arise
from intrinsic anti-site disorder. We demonstrate the applicability of our
design concept on a second material, Mn-Fe-Ga, with a magnetic transition above
room temperature, exemplifying the universality of the concept and the
feasibility of room-temperature applications. Our study points to a new
direction for novel magneto-electronic devices. At the same time it suggests a
new route for realizing rare-earth free exchange-biased hard magnets, where the
second quadrant magnetization can be stabilized by the exchange bias.

class of existing models for many applications in imaging sciences. To solve
the resulting possibly nonconvex, nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz optimization
problem, we adapt the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with a
general dual step-size to solve a reformulation that contains three blocks of
variables, and analyze its convergence. We show that for any dual step-size
less than the golden ratio, there exists a computable threshold such that if
the penalty parameter is chosen above such a threshold and the sequence thus
generated by our ADMM is bounded, then the cluster point of the sequence gives
a stationary point of the nonconvex optimization problem. We achieve this via a
potential function specifically constructed for our ADMM. Moreover, we
establish the global convergence of the whole sequence if, in addition, this
special potential function is a Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz function. Furthermore,
we present a simple strategy for initializing the algorithm to guarantee
boundedness of the sequence. Finally, we perform numerical experiments
comparing our ADMM with the proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM)
proposed in [5] on the background/foreground extraction problem with real data.
The numerical results show that our ADMM with a nontrivial dual step-size is
efficient.

the instantons between the two bound states in the compact photon phase. It is
the Berry phase interference effects in the instanton tunneling event which

the abundance ratio between the protonated and non protonated forms of a

an abundance ratio NCCNH+/NCCN of 1e-4, which implies that the abundance of
cyanogen in dark clouds could be as high as (1-10)e-8 relative to H2, i.e.,
comparable to that of other abundant nitriles such as HCN, HNC, and HC3N.

  Internship Match","MSc thesis",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis was submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
Masters Degree in the Department of Computer Science, Bar-Ilan University.
  The final step in getting an Israeli M.D. is performing a year-long
internship in one of the hospitals in Israel. Internships are decided upon by a
lottery, which is known as ""The Internship Lottery"". In 2014 we redesigned the
lottery, replacing it with a more efficient one. The new method is based on
calculating a tentative lottery, in which each student has some probability of
getting to each hospital. Then a computer program ""trades"" between the
students, where trade is performed only if it is beneficial to both sides. This
trade creates surplus, which translates to more students getting one of their
top choices. The average student improved his place by $0.91$ seats. The new
method can improve the welfare of medical graduates, by giving them more
probability to get to one of their top choices. It can be applied in internship
markets in other countries as well.
  This thesis presents the market, the redesign process and the new mechanism
which is now in use. There are two main lessons that we have learned from this
market. The first is the ""Do No Harm"" principle, which states that (almost) all
participants should prefer the new mechanism to the old one. The second is that
new approaches need to be used when dealing with two-body problems in object
assignment. We focus on the second lesson, and study two-body problems in the
context of the assignment problem. We show that decomposing stochastic
assignment matrices to deterministic allocations is NP-hard in the presence of
couples, and present a polynomial time algorithm with the optimal worst case
guarantee. We also study the performance of our algorithm on real-world and on
simulated data.

methods are based on the same PDE framework, defined in the coupled space of

enhancement of elongated structures while preserving crossing structures. In
the first method we use the enhancement PDE for contextual regularization of a
fiber orientation distribution (FOD) that is obtained on individual voxels from
high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data via constrained
spherical deconvolution (CSD). Thereby we improve the FOD as input for
subsequent tractography. Secondly, we introduce the fiber to bundle coherence
(FBC), a measure for quantification of fiber alignment. The FBC is computed
from a tractography result using the same PDE framework and provides a
criterion for removing the spurious fibers. We validate the proposed
combination of CSD and enhancement on phantom data and on human data, acquired
with different scanning protocols. On the phantom data we find that PDE
enhancements improve both local metrics and global metrics of tractography
results, compared to CSD without enhancements. On the human data we show that
the enhancements allow for a better reconstruction of crossing fiber bundles
and they reduce the variability of the tractography output with respect to the
acquisition parameters. Finally, we show that both the enhancement of the FODs
and the use of the FBC measure on the tractography improve the stability with
respect to different stochastic realizations of probabilistic tractography.

$\Omega$ with infinite measure has finite heat content for all $t>0$. We also
obtain upper and lower bounds for the heat content of $\Omega$ in $M$.
Two-sided bounds are obtained for the heat loss of $\Omega$ in $M$ if the

  utilizing Cherenkov telescopes as receivers and beam-wander correction in

  of Madrid / Spanish National Research Center), June 2015",,,,"astro-ph.IM physics.ins-det physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This thesis focuses on the two main applications where free-space optical
communication (FSOC) can bring the most significant impact: interplanetary
communications and quantum communications. Consequently, the dissertation is
structured in two sections. In the first one, a novel proposal is suggested
regarding to using Cherenkov telescopes as ground-station receivers. A
feasibility study addresses the posibility of using the technology developed
for the gamma-ray telescopes that will make up the Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA) in the implementation of a new kind of ground station. Among the main
advantages that these telescopes provide are the much larger apertures needed
to overcome the power limitation that ground-based gamma-ray astronomy and
deep-space optical communication both have. Also, the large number of big
telescopes that will be built for CTA will make it possible to reduce unitary
costs by economy-scale production. The second section of the thesis is framed
in the field of free-space Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which has become a
new paradigm in the discipline of information security. This technique offers a
theoretically-secure way to communicate over an insecure channel since the
presence of an eventual eavesdropper can be detected. The main challenge of
Free-space QKD is the need to operate both under strong atmospheric turbulence
and daylight background noise. To mitigate these effects, a trade-off is
usually required when designing the receiver's optics, since a narrow
field-of-view improves background noise rejection, but increases
turbulence-related losses and a wide field-of-view produces the opposite
effect. A correction system for atmospheric turbulence is proposed to overcome
both limitations at the same time, and different strategies are analyzed and
experimented to carry out the implementation and integration within the QKD
system.

networks. Most of these mechanisms are effective, and security experts can
handle them to achieve a sufficient level of security for any given system.
However, most of these systems have not been designed with focus on good
usability for the average end user. Today, the average end user often struggles
with understanding and using security mechanisms. Other security mechanisms are
simply annoying for end users. As the overall security of any system is only as
strong as the weakest link in this system, bad usability of IT security
mechanisms may result in operating errors, resulting in insecure systems.
Buying decisions of end users may be affected by the usability of security
mechanisms. Hence software providers may decide to better have no security
mechanism then one with a bad usability. Usability of IT security mechanisms is
one of the most underestimated properties of applications and systems. Even IT
security itself is often only an afterthought. Hence, usability of security
mechanisms is often the afterthought of an afterthought. Software developers
are missing guidelines on how to build security mechanisms with good usability
for end users. This paper presents some guidelines that should help software
developers to improve end user usability of security-related mechanisms, and
analyzes common applications based on these guidelines.

circular optical apertures, since they form a complete and orthonormal basis on
the unit disk. In [Diaz et all, 2014] we introduced a new Zernike basis for
elliptic and annular optical apertures based on an appropriate diffeomorphism
between the unit disk and the ellipse and the annulus. Here, we present a
generalization of this Zernike basis for a variety of important optical
apertures, paying special attention to polygons and the polygonal facets
present in segmented mirror telescopes. On the contrary to ad hoc solutions,
most of them based on the Gram-Smith orthonormalization method, here we
consider a piece-wise diffeomorphism that transforms the unit disk into the
polygon under consideration. We use this mapping to define a Zernike-like
orthonormal system over the polygon. We also consider ensembles of polygonal
facets that are essential in the design of segmented mirror telescopes. This
generalization, based on in-plane warping of the basis functions, provides a
unique solution, and what is more important, it guarantees a reasonable level
of invariance of the mathematical properties and the physical meaning of the
initial basis functions. Both, the general form and the explicit expressions
for a typical example of telescope optical aperture are provided.

material is at a higher one, then we study a second (reverse) situation where
the material temperatures are inverted. When the two fluxes corresponding to
the two situations are different, the materials are said to exhibit a thermal
rectification, a property with potential applications in thermal regulation.
Rectification variations with temperature and separation distance are here
reported. Calculations are performed using material optical data experimentally
determined by Fourier transform emission spectrometry of heated materials
between ambient temperature (around 300 K) and 1480 K. It is shown that
rectification is much more important in the near-field domain, i.e. at
separation distances smaller than the thermal wavelength. In addition, we see
that the larger is the temperature difference, the larger is rectification.
Large rectification is finally interpreted due to a weakening of the SiC
surface polariton when temperature increases, a weakening which affects much
less SiO2 resonances.

triangular relay network with an untrusted relay aiming at enhancing the
wireless communication secrecy between the source and the destination node. In
order to shield the square quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals
transmitted from the source node to the relay, the destination node designs and
transmits artificial noise (AN) symbols to jam the relay reception. The
objective of our considered AN design is to degrade the error probability
performance at the untrusted relay, for different types of channel state
information (CSI) at the destination. By considering perfect knowledge of the
instantaneous CSI of the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links, we
first present an analytical expression for the symbol error rate (SER)
performance at the relay. Based on the assumption of an average power
constraint at the destination node, we then derive the optimal phase and power
distribution of the AN that maximizes the SER at the relay. Furthermore, we
obtain the optimal AN design for the case where only statistical CSI is
available at the destination node. For both cases, our study reveals that the
Gaussian distribution is generally not optimal to generate AN symbols. In
particular, the conducted numerical results show that the Gaussian distributed
AN is far from optimal. The presented AN design takes into account practical
parameters for the communication links, such as QAM signaling and maximum
likelihood decoding.

phenomena occurring at the sub-atomic level, but the reason for the choice of
symmetry group and the large number of particles considered elementary, is
still unknown. Along the lines of previous preon models positing a substructure
to explain these aspects, Bilson-Thompson showed how the first family of
elementary particles is realized as the crossings of braids made of three
strands, with charges resulting from twists of those strands with certain
conditions; in this topological model, there are only two distinct neutrino
states. Modeling the particles as braids implies these braids must be the
representation space of a Lie algebra, giving the symmetries of the Standard
Model. In this paper, this representation is made explicit, obtaining the
raising operators associated with the Lie algebra of $SU(5)$, one of the
earliest grand unified theories. Because the braids form a group, the action of
these operators are braids themselves, leading to their identification as gauge
bosons. Possible choices for the other two families are also given. Although
this realization of particles as braids is lacking a dynamical framework, it is
very suggestive, especially when considered as a natural method of adding
matter to loop quantum gravity.

This motivates us to consider the magnetic twist as the cause of Alfven
frequency continuum in the coronal loops, which can support the resonant
absorption as a rapid damping mechanism for the observed coronal kink
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations. We model a coronal loop with a straight
cylindrical magnetic flux tube which has constant but different densities in
the interior and exterior regions. The magnetic field is assumed to be constant
and aligned with the cylinder axis everywhere except a thin layer near the
boundary of the flux tube which has an additional small magnetic field twist.
Then, we investigate a number of possible instabilities that may arise in our
model. In the thin tube thin boundary approximation, we derive the dispersion
relation and solve it analytically to obtain the frequencies and damping rates
of the fundamental (l=1) and first/second overtone (l=2,3) kink (m=1) MHD
modes. We conclude that the resonant absorption by the magnetic twist can
justify the rapid damping of kink MHD waves observed in coronal loops.
Furthermore, the magnetic twist in the inhomogeneous layer can cause deviations
from P1/P2=2 and P1/P3=3 which are comparable with the observations.

limited by and large to the division of networks into only two or three
communities, with divisions into more than three being achieved by repeated
two-way division. Here we present a spectral algorithm that can directly divide
a network into any number of communities. The algorithm makes use of a mapping
from modularity maximization to a vector partitioning problem, combined with a
fast heuristic for vector partitioning. We compare the performance of this
