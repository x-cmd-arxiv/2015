cosmological model building. This assumption is now being rigorously tested
using the almost full sky measurements of the CMB anisotropies. A major hurdle
in any such analysis is to handle the large biases induced due to the process
of masking. We have developed a new method of analysis, using the bipolar
spherical harmonic basis functions, in which we semi-analytically evaluate the
modifications to SI violation induced by the mask. The method developed here is
generic and can be potentially used to search for any arbitrary form of SI
violation. We specifically demonstrate the working of this method by recovering
the Doppler boost signal from a set of simulated, masked CMB skies.

the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR) has an overabundance of outliers,
compared to what would be expected from a Gaussian distribution of residuals,
with significantly lower metallicities than predicted from their stellar mass
and star formation rate (SFR). This low-metallicity population has lower
stellar masses, bimodial specific SFRs with enhanced star formation within the
aperture and smaller half-light radii than the general sample, and is hence a
physically distinct population. We show that they are consistent with being
galaxies that are merging or have recently merged with a satellite galaxy. In
this scenario, low-metallicity gas flows in from large radii, diluting the
metallicity of star-forming regions and enhancing the specific SFR until the
inflowing gas is processed and the metallicity has recovered. We introduce a
simple model in which mergers with a mass ratio larger than a minimum dilute
the central galaxy's metallicity by an amount that is proportional to the
stellar mass ratio for a constant time, and show that it provides an excellent
fit to the distribution of FMR residuals. We find the dilution time-scale to be
$\tau=1.568_{-0.027}^{+0.029}$ Gyr, the average metallicity depression caused
by a 1:1 merger to be $\alpha=0.2480_{-0.0020}^{+0.0017}$ dex and the minimum
mass ratio merger that can be discerned from the intrinsic Gaussian scatter in
the FMR to be $\xi_\text{min}=0.2030_{-0.0095}^{+0.0127}$ (these are
statistical errors only). From this we derive that the average metallicity
depression caused by a merger with mass ratio between 1:5 and 1:1 is 0.114 dex.

applications where the computational costs of the selection rules are
comparable, the Gauss-Southwell selection rule tends to perform substantially
better than random coordinate selection. We give a simple analysis of the
Gauss-Southwell rule showing that---except in extreme cases---its convergence
rate is faster than choosing random coordinates. Further, in this work we (i)
show that exact coordinate optimization improves the convergence rate for

several risk measures including the VaR, TVaR and other tail measures. Then, we
consider collective risk model based on dependence, where several general

Poisson, negative binomial and logarithmic distributions as primary
distributions. In the collective Pareto-Poisson model, the PDF is a function of
the Kummer confluent hypergeometric function, and in the Pareto-negative
binomial is a function of the Gauss hypergeometric function. Using the data set
based on one-year vehicle insurance policies taken out in 2004-2005 (Jong and

of the problem, we characterize when second-order critical points of the smooth

is some frequency dependence of the variability in optical/UV bands in the
sense that the variability amplitude increases with increasing frequency;
however, the X-ray emissions disagree with this trend as the variability
amplitude decreases from soft to hard X-ray bands. On intra-day time scales 3C

excitations, preventing ergodicity. An interesting consequence is that high
energy excited states can exhibit quantum coherent properties, such as symmetry
protected topological (SPT) order, that otherwise only occur in equilibrium
ground states. Here, we ask: which types of SPT orders can be realized in
highly excited states of a many-body (MB) localized system? We argue that this
question is equivalent to whether an SPT order can be realized in an exactly
solvable lattice model of commuting projectors. This perspective enables a
sharp definition of MB localizability. Using this criterion, it is
straightforward to establish that whereas all bosonic SPTs in spatial
dimensions $d=1,\,2,\,3$ are MB localizable, chiral phases (e.g. quantum Hall
fluids) are not. We also show that free fermion SPTs in $d >1$ (including
topological insulators and superconductors) cannot be localized if interactions
are weak. A key question is whether strong interactions can render them MB
localizable, which we study in the context of a class of $d=2$ topological
superconductors. Using a decorated domain wall (DDW) approach we show that some
phases in this class are MB localizable, when they correspond to bosonic SPT
orders. However, a similar DDW approach faces a fatal obstruction to realizing
certain intrinsically fermionic SPT orders, an issue we argue may persist
beyond this specific construction.

requires knowledge of both host and vector demographics in advance of an
outbreak. Whereas host population data is typically available, for novel
disease introductions there is a high chance of the pathogen utilising a vector
for which data is unavailable. This presents a barrier to estimating the
parameters of dynamical models representing host-vector-pathogen interaction,
and hence limits their ability to provide quantitative risk forecasts. The
Theileria orientalis (Ikeda) outbreak in New Zealand cattle demonstrates this
problem: even though the vector has received extensive laboratory study, a high
degree of uncertainty persists over its national demographic distribution.
Addressing this, we develop a Bayesian data assimilation approach whereby
indirect observations of vector activity inform a seasonal spatio-temporal risk
surface within a stochastic epidemic model. We provide quantitative predictions
for the future spread of the epidemic, quantifying uncertainty in the model
parameters, case infection times, and the disease status of undetected
infections. Importantly, we demonstrate how our model learns sequentially as
the epidemic unfolds, and provides evidence for changing epidemic dynamics
through time. Our approach therefore provides a significant advance in rapid
decision support for novel vector-borne disease outbreaks.

<r>~10^{15-18} cm (typically ~10^{2-4} r_s) from their black hole, their mass
outflow rates are of the order <M_out>~0.01-1 Msun/yr or ~(0.01-1) M_edd and
kinetic power is constrained to <L_k> ~10^{43-45} erg/s, equivalent to
~(0.1-10%) L_edd. We find a fundamental correlation between the source
bolometric luminosity and the wind velocity, with v_out \propto L_bol^{\alpha}
and \alpha=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ (90% confidence), which indicates that more
luminous AGN tend to harbour faster Fe K winds. The mass outflow rate M_out,
kinetic power L_k and momentum flux P_out of the winds are also consequently
correlated with L_bol, such that more massive and more energetic winds are
present in more luminous AGN. We investigate these properties in the framework
of a continuum-driven wind, showing that the observed relationships are broadly
consistent with a wind being accelerated by continuum-scattering. We find that,
globally, a significant fraction (~85%) of the sample can plausibly exceed the
L_k/L_bol~0.5% threshold thought necessary for feedback, while 45% may also
exceed the less conservative ~5% of L_bol threshold as well. This suggests that
the winds may be energetically significant for AGN--host-galaxy feedback
processes.

  We show, that Alice can transmit $X$ to Bob in expected $H(X|Y) +
2\sqrt{H(X|Y)} + O(\log_2\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right))$ number of bits.
Moreover, we show that every one-round protocol $\pi$ with information

communication about $I + 2\sqrt{I}$ bits. This improves a result by Braverman

we show how to solve this problem (transmitting $X$) using $3H(X|Y) +

extended by considering the coupling between a quadratic mass term and

exists while that is not possible for the Einstein tensor. It is already known
that the Ricci scalar generates a localized solution but the metrics do not.
Therefore, it can be conclude that divergenceless tensors do not localize the
zero mode of gauge fields. The result is valid for any warp factor recovering
the RS metrics at the boundaries, and therefore is valid for RS I and II
models. We also compute resonances for all couplings. These are calculated
using the transfer matrix method. The cases studied consider the standard RS
with delta-like branes, and branes generated by kinks and domain-wall as well.
The parameters are changed to control the thickness of the smooth brane. We
find that, for all cases considered, geometrical coupling does not generate
resonances. This enforces similar results for the coupling with the Ricci
scalar and points to the existence of some unidentified fundamental structure

light Dirac flavors in the fundamental representation feature all the
ingredients under theoretical control, including a strongly-coupled IR fixed
point, composite partners for all Standard Model fermions, absence of Landau

that can only be assessed via non-perturbative methods like lattice QCD. A
distinctive collider signature is long-lived hadrons with fractional charges.
  Vacuum alignment is controlled by the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of the coset

also demonstrate the broader applicability of this framework to three other

spatio-temporal system, we introduce centrality measures that evaluate the
importance of a node as a structural bridge and its role in supporting
spatio-temporally efficient flows through the network. This exposes the complex

peaks at low-frequencies ($\sim 7$ GHz) at early times, only $2.2$ days after
the burst occurred. More notably, the radio spectrum at frequencies above $10$

afterglows. This cut-off can be explained if the emitting electrons are either
mono-energetic or originate from a rather steep, $dN/dE \propto E^{-4}$,
power-law energy distribution. An alternative electron acceleration mechanism
may be required to produce such an electron energy distribution. Furthermore,
the radio spectrum exhibits a secondary underlying and slowly varying

emission from both a reverse and a forward shock. We discuss our results in

explain the spectroscopic and dynamical properties of early-type galaxies.
However, no observations have yet been able to disentangle the physical driver.
We analyse here a sample of 24 early-type galaxies drawn from the CALIFA
survey, deriving in a homogeneous way their stellar population and kinematic
properties. We find that the local IMF is tightly related to the local
metallicity, becoming more bottom-heavy towards metal-rich populations. Our
result, combined with the galaxy mass-metallicity relation, naturally explains
previous claims of a galaxy mass-IMF relation, derived from non-IFU spectra. If
we assume that - within the star formation environment of early-type galaxies -
metallicity is the main driver of IMF variations, a significant revision of the
interpretation of galaxy evolution observables is necessary.

velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star K2=0.233(13) FWHM. This new
correlation, when combined with orbital periods (i.e. through photometric light
curves), opens the possibility to estimate compact object mass functions from
single integration, low-resolution spectroscopy. On the other hand, CVs above
the period gap are found to follow a flatter correlation, a likely consequence
of their larger mass ratios. We also find that the FWHM traces the disc
velocity at ~42% R_L1, independently of binary mass ratio. In addition, for a
given FWHM, BHs tend to have lower EWs than CVs. This might be explained by the
fact that CVs must be seen at higher inclinations to mimic the same projected
disc velocities as BH SXTs. For the same reason CVs with FWHM>~1500 km/s are
mostly eclipsing while none of our sample BHs are. Further, we show that there
is a vacant/unoccupied region for CVs in the FWHM-EW plane defined by FWHM >
2568 ( 1 - (9/EW)**2 )**0.5 (km/s). Both the FWHM-K2 correlation and the

collisionless systems subject to time-dependent gravitational forces without
resorting to maximum-entropy probabilities. We show that collisionless
relaxation can be viewed as a special type of diffusion process in the
integral-of-motion space. In time-varying potentials with a fixed spatial
symmetry the diffusion coefficients are closely related to virial quantities,
such as the specific moment of inertia, the virial factor and the mean kinetic
and potential energy of microcanonical particle ensembles. The non-equilibrium
distribution function (DF) is found by convolving the initial DF with the Green
function that solves Einstein's equation for freely diffusing particles. Such a
convolution also yields a natural solution to the Fokker-Planck equations in
the energy space. Our mathematical formalism can be generalized to potentials
with a time-varying symmetry, where diffusion extends over multiple dimensions
of the integral-of-motion space. The new probability theory is in many ways
analogous to stochastic calculus, with two significant differences: (i) the
equations of motion that govern the trajectories of particles are fully
deterministic, and (ii) the diffusion coefficients can be derived
self-consistently from microcanonical phase-space averages without relying on
ergodicity assumptions. For illustration we follow the cold collapse of
$N$-body models in a time-dependent logarithmic potential. Comparison between
the analytical and numerical results shows excellent agreement in regions where

factor $S_q(f)$, at finite wave-vector $q$, exhibits a power-law behavior both
at high and low frequencies $f$, with exponents that are connected to one
another and to an anomalous dynamical exponent through relations that differ at
$T = 0$ and $T = \infty$. The low-frequency power-law behavior of the structure
factor is inherited by any generic probe with a finite band-width and is of the
form $1/f^\alpha$ with $0.5 < \alpha < 1$. An analytical calculation of the
structure factor, assuming a limiting distribution of the RG flow parameters

we demonstrate that this form of the structure factor, at high temperatures, is
a manifestation of anomalous diffusion which directly follows from a
generalized spin-diffusion propagator. We also argue that $1/f$-noise is
intimately connected to many-body-localization at finite temperatures. In two

Vrot result in very different velocity functions. We show how the W50 velocity
function, i.e. using the HI profile line width at 50% of peak HI flux to
measure Vrot, can be reconciled with a LCDM cosmology. Our semi-empirical
methodology allows us to determine the region of rotation curves that are
probed by HI measurements (RHI), and shows that the Vrot of dwarfs are
generally measured at a fraction of Rmax, explaining their tendency to have
rising rotation curves. We provide fitting formulae for relating RHI and Reff
(the effective radius) to the virial radius of DM halos. To continue to use
velocity functions as a probe of LCDM cosmology, it is necessary to be precise
about how the different measures of rotation velocity are probing the mass of
the DM halos, dropping the assumption that any measure of rotational velocity
can be equally used as a proxy for Vmax.

starburst galaxies which are interacting with the overall fraction of

confirm that in starburst galaxies the fraction of interacting galaxies is

We discuss how adjusting the starburst definition influences the final result

a general picture. Our overall conclusion is that interactions can and do
increase the number of starburst galaxies, and that this result is extremely
robust. By far most starburst galaxies, however, show no evidence of a present

hundred km above the horizon to purple at 1000-1500 km above the horizon. The
spectrum observed in 9 filters spanning wavelengths from 250 nm to 1000 nm has
a prominent H-alpha line and roughly agrees with laboratory simulated auroras.
Auroras in both hemispheres vary dramatically with longitude. Auroras form
bright arcs between 70 and 80 degree latitude north and between 65 and 80
degree latitude south, which sometimes spiral around the pole, and sometimes
form double arcs. A large 10,000-km-scale longitudinal brightness structure
persists for more than 100 hours. This structure rotates approximately together
with Saturn. On top of the large steady structure, the auroras brighten
suddenly on the timescales of a few minutes. These brightenings repeat with a
period of about 1 hour. Smaller, 1000-km-scale structures may move faster or
lag behind Saturn's rotation on timescales of tens of minutes. The persistence
of nearly-corotating large bright longitudinal structure in the auroral oval

extensions, emphasizing how modifications of the kinetic and potential
structure of the graviton and modifications of the coupling to matter are
related. We then generalize existing no-go arguments in the metric language to
the vielbein language in second-order form. We give an ADM argument to show
that the most promising extensions to the kinetic term and matter coupling
contain a Boulware-Deser ghost. However, as recently emphasized, we may still
be able to view these extensions as effective field theories below some cutoff
scale. To address this possibility, we show that there is a decoupling limit
where a ghost appears for a wide class of matter couplings and kinetic terms.
In particular, we show that there is a decoupling limit where the linear
effective vielbein matter coupling contains a ghost. Using the insight we gain
from this decoupling limit analysis, we place an upper bound on the cutoff for
the linear effective vielbein coupling. This result can be generalized to new
kinetic interactions in the vielbein language in second-order form. Combined
with recent results, this provides a strong uniqueness argument on the form of
ghost-free massive gravity, bi-gravity, and multi-gravity.

expected degrees are $o(\log n)$ fail to concentrate; the obstruction is caused
by vertices with abnormally high and low degrees. We show that concentration
can be restored if we regularize the degrees of such vertices, and one can do
this in various ways. As an example, let us reweight or remove enough edges to
make all degrees bounded above by $O(d)$ where $d=\max np_{ij}$. Then we show
that the resulting adjacency matrix $A'$ concentrates with the optimal rate:
$\|A' - \mathbb{E} A\| = O(\sqrt{d})$. Similarly, if we make all degrees
bounded below by $d$ by adding weight $d/n$ to all edges, then the resulting
Laplacian concentrates with the optimal rate: $\|L(A') - L(\mathbb{E} A')\| =
O(1/\sqrt{d})$. Our approach is based on Grothendieck-Pietsch factorization,

bipartite graph $G=(A \cup B, E)$, with an adjacency list of each vertex being
a linearly ordered list of ties, which are subsets of vertices equally good for
a given vertex. Ties are disjoint and may contain one vertex. A matching $M$ is
a set of vertex-disjoint edges. An edge $(x,y) \in E \setminus M$ is a {\em
blocking edge} for $M$ if $x$ is either unmatched or strictly prefers $y$ to
its current partner in $M$, and $y$ is either unmatched or strictly prefers $x$
to its current partner in $M$ or is indifferent between them. A matching is
{\em strongly stable} if there is no blocking edge with respect to it. We
present an algorithm for the generation of all strongly stable matchings, thus
solving an open problem already stated in the book by Gusfield and Irving
\cite{GI}. It has previously been shown that strongly stable matchings form a
distributive lattice and although the number of strongly stable matchings can
be exponential in the number of vertices, we show that there exists a partial
order with $O(m)$ elements representing all strongly stable matchings, where
$m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph. We give two algorithms that
construct two such representations: one in $O(nm^2)$ time and the other in
$O(nm)$ time, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph. Note that
the construction of the second representation has the same time complexity as
that of computing a single strongly stable matching.

recent years. This family of materials allows for the realization of versatile
electronic devices and holds promise for next-generation (opto)electronics.
Their electronic properties strongly depend on the number of layers, making
them interesting from a fundamental standpoint. For electronic applications,
semiconducting 2D materials benefit from sizable mobilities and large on/off
ratios, due to the large modulation achievable via the gate field-effect.
Moreover, being mechanically strong and flexible, these materials can withstand
large strain (>10\%) before rupture, making them interesting for strain
engineering and flexible devices. Even in their single layer form,
semiconducting 2D materials have demonstrated efficient light absorption,
enabling large responsivity in photodetectors. Therefore, semiconducting
layered 2D materials are strong candidates for optoelectronic applications,
especially for photodetection. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in
photodetectors based on semiconducting 2D materials, focusing on the transition
metal dichalcogenides, novel van der Waals materials, black phosphorus, and

1/$n$, regardless of the relative concentration assignment of the tile types in
the system. First, we show this is possible for $n=2$ (a \emph{robust fair coin

$\mathcal{O}(1)$ space usage. We accompany our primary construction with
variants that show trade-offs in space complexity, initial seed size,
temperature, tile complexity, bias, and extensibility, and also prove some
negative results. As an application, we combine our coin-flip system with a
result of Chandran, Gopalkrishnan, and Reif to show that for any positive

constant-width linear assembly of expected length $n$ for any concentration

problem of robust random number generation in the aTAM for all $n$. Two
variants of robust random bit generation solutions are presented: an unbounded
space solution and a bounded space solution which incurs a small bias. Further,
we consider the harder scenario where tile concentrations change arbitrarily at

mechanism underlying the cell alignment and clustering is not fully understood.
Motivated by studies of clustering in self-propelled rods, we hypothesized that
M. xanthus cells can align and form clusters through pure mechanical
interactions among cells and between cells and substrate. We test this
hypothesis using an agent-based simulation framework in which each agent is
based on the biophysical model of an individual M. xanthus cell. We show that
model agents, under realistic cell flexibility values, can align and form cell
clusters but only when periodic reversals of cell directions are suppressed.
However, by extending our model to introduce the observed ability of cells to
deposit and follow slime trails, we show that effective trail-following leads
to clusters in reversing cells. Furthermore, we conclude that mechanical cell
alignment combined with slime-trail-following is sufficient to explain the
distinct clustering behaviors observed for wild-type and non-reversing M.

and offer bundles at discounted prices triggered by demand volumes. Each buyer
acts strategically in order to maximize her utility, given by the difference
between product valuation and price paid. Buyers report their valuations in
terms of reserve prices on sets of items, and might be willing to pay prices
different than the market price in order to subsidize other buyers and to
trigger discounts. The resulting price discrimination can be interpreted as a
redistribution of the total discount. We consider a notion of stability that
looks at unilateral deviations, and show that efficient allocations - the ones
maximizing the social welfare - can be stabilized by prices that enjoy
desirable properties of rationality and fairness. These dictate that buyers pay
higher prices only to subsidize others who contribute to the activation of the
desired discounts, and that they pay premiums over the discounted price
proportionally to their surplus - the difference between their current utility
and the utility of their best alternative. Therefore, the resulting price
discrimination appears to be desirable to buyers. Building on this existence
result, and letting N, M and c be the numbers of buyers, vendors and product
types, we propose a O(N^2+NM^c) algorithm that, given an efficient allocation,
computes prices that are rational and fair and that stabilize the market. The
algorithm first determines the redistribution of the discount between groups of
buyers with an equal product choice, and then computes single buyers' prices.
Our results show that if a desirable form of price discrimination is
implemented then social efficiency and stability can coexists in a market
presenting subtle externalities, and computing individual prices from market

implementation of key- value stores, the following property, usually referred
to as consistency in computer science and engineering, is an important
requirement: as the data stored changes, the latest version of the data must be
accessible to a client that connects to the storage system. An information
theoretic formulation called multi-version coding is introduced in the paper,
in order to study storage costs of consistent distributed storage systems.
Multi-version coding is characterized by {\nu} totally ordered versions of a
message, and a storage system with n servers. At each server, values
corresponding to an arbitrary subset of the {\nu} versions are received and
encoded. For any subset of c servers in the storage system, the value
corresponding to the latest common version, or a later version as per the total
ordering, among the c servers is required to be decodable. An achievable
multi-version code construction via linear coding and a converse result that
shows that the construction is approximately tight, are provided. An
implication of the converse is that there is an inevitable price, in terms of
storage cost, to ensure consistency in distributed storage systems.

  The PVAR combines the advantages of AVAR and MVAR. PVAR is good for long-term
analysis because the wavelet spans over $2 \tau$, the same of the AVAR wavelet;
and good for short-term analysis because the response to white and flicker PM
is $1/\tau^3$ and $1/\tau^2$, same as the MVAR.
  After setting the theoretical framework, we study the degrees of freedom and
the confidence interval for the most common noise types. Then, we focus on the
detection of a weak noise process at the transition - or corner - where a
faster process rolls off. This new perspective raises the question of which
variance detects the weak process with the shortest data record. Our
simulations show that PVAR is a fortunate tradeoff. PVAR is superior to MVAR in
all cases, exhibits the best ability to divide between fast noise phenomena (up
to flicker FM), and is almost as good as AVAR for the detection of random walk
and drift.

numbers of small loads, such as households and small and medium-sized
businesses. We introduce a novel auction format, called a staggered clock-proxy
auction (SCPA), for on-line scheduling of these loads. This is a two phase
format, consisting of: a sequence of overlapping iterative ascending-price
clock auctions, one for each time-slot over a finite decision horizon, and; a
set of proxy auctions that begin at the termination of each individual clock
auction, and which determine the final price and allocation for each time-slot.
The overlapping design of the clock phases grant bidders the ability to
effectively bid on inter-temporal bundles of electricity use, thereby focusing
on the most relevant parts of the price-quantity space. Since electricity is a
divisible good, the proxy auction uses demand-schedule bids, which the
aggregator uses to compute a uniform-price partial competitive equilibrium for
each time slot. We show that, under mild assumptions on the bidders' utilities
functions, the proxy phase implements the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves outcome, which
makes straightforward bidding in the proxy phase a Bayes-Nash equilibrium.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the SCPA in a scenario comprised of household
agents with three different utility function types, and show how the mechanism

roots. We show that the unbounded problem can be reduced to the bounded problem
if there is at most one rationally linearly independent frequency, or if there
are two rationally linearly independent frequencies and all characteristic
roots are simple. We complete the picture by showing that decidability of the
unbounded problem in the case of two (or more) rationally linearly independent

meaningfully restrict $\hat{f}$ to the unit sphere of $\mathbb{R}^n$ provided
$f \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $1 < p < 2$. This result can be rewritten in
terms of the estimates for the spectral measure of Laplacian. Guillarmou,
Hassell and Sikora formulated a sufficient condition of the restriction
theorem, via spectral measure, on abstract metric measure spaces. But they only
proved the result in a special case. The present note aims to give a complete

surfaces is numerically investigated with a thermal multiphase lattice
Boltzmann model with liquid-vapor phase change. The capability of the model for
simulating evaporation is validated via the D2 law. Using the model, we first
study the performances of Leidenfrost droplets on horizontal ratchet surfaces.
It is numerically shown that the motion of self-propelled Leidenfrost droplets
on ratchet surfaces is owing to the asymmetry of the ratchets and the vapor
flows beneath the droplets. It is found that the Leidenfrost droplets move in
the direction toward the slowly inclined side from the ratchet peaks, which
agrees with the direction of droplet motion in experiments [Linke et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett., 2006, 96, 154502]. Moreover, the influences of the ratchet aspect
ratio are investigated. For the considered ratchet surfaces, a critical value
of the ratchet aspect ratio is approximately found, which corresponds to the
maximum droplet moving velocity. Furthermore, the processes that the
Leidenfrost droplets climb uphill on inclined ratchet surfaces are also
studied. Numerical results show that the maximum inclination angle at which a
Leidenfrost droplet can still climb uphill successfully is affected by the
initial radius of the droplet.

different, within more than 2 $\sigma$, from the slope of the prompt

$L_{f}$, and the pulse duration, $T^{*}_{f}$, from the time since the GRB

phases in the energy-duration distributions with the afterglow emitted energy
being on average $10\%$ of the prompt emission. Moreover, the distribution of
prompt pulse versus afterglow spectral indexes do not show any correlation. In
the further analysis we demonstrate that the $L_{peak}-L_a$ distribution, where
$L_{peak}$ is the peak luminosity from the start of the burst, is characterized
with a considerably higher Spearman correlation coefficient, $\rho=0.79$, than
the one involving the averaged prompt luminosity, $L_{prompt}-L_a$, for the

result from the redshift dependences of the luminosities, namely from their

Combining HCN, CO, and infrared (IR) emission, we investigate the role of dense
gas in Star Formation (SF), finding systematic variations in both the apparent
dense gas fraction and the apparent SF efficiency (SFE) of dense gas. The
latter may be unexpected, given the popularity of gas density threshold models
to explain SF scaling relations. We used the IRAM 30-m telescope to observe
HCN(1-0) across 29 nearby disk galaxies whose CO(2-1) emission has previously
been mapped by the HERACLES survey. Because our observations span a range of
galactocentric radii, we are able to investigate the properties of the dense
gas as a function of local conditions. We focus on how the IR/CO, HCN/CO, and
IR/HCN ratios (observational cognates of the SFE, dense gas fraction, and dense
gas SFE) depend on the stellar surface density and the molecular/atomic ratio.
The HCN/CO ratio correlates tightly with these two parameters across a range of
2.1 dex and increases in the high surface density parts of galaxies.
Simultaneously, the IR/HCN ratio decreases systematically with these same
parameters and is ~6-8 times lower near galaxy centers than in the outer
regions. For fixed line-mass conversion factors, these results are incompatible
with a simple model in which SF depends only on the gas mass above some density
threshold. Only a specific set of environment-dependent conversion factors can
render our observations compatible with such a model. Whole cloud models, such
as the theory of turbulence regulated SF, do a better job of matching our data.
We explore one such model in which variations in the Mach number and in the
mean density would respectively drive the trends within galaxy disks and the
differences between disk and merging galaxies (abridged).

strategy is to write the two-point correlation function (2pcf) as the most

statistical anisotropy will show up if and only if any coefficient of the

detection will not in general elucidate the origin of the anisotropy. In this
work we show that two new sets of four angles and basis functions exist which
completely specifies the 2pcf, while, at the same time, offering a clearer
geometrical interpretation of the mechanisms generating the signal. Since the
coefficients of these expansions are zero if and only if isotropy holds, they
act as a simple and geometrically motivated null test of statistical isotropy,

constitutive equation at the investigated range of stresses, and its possible
practical applications. Laminates with different cell size, which controls
internal time scale, impacted by the plates with different thicknesses,
determining the incoming pulse duration, were investigated. It has been
observed that the ratio of the duration of the incoming pulse to the internal
characteristic time determines the nature of the high amplitude dissipative
propagating waves, the oscillatory shock like profile, the train of localized
pulses or a single localized pulse. These localized quasistationary waves
resemble solitary waves even in the presence of dissipation: the similar pulses
emerged from different initial conditions, indicating that they are inherent
properties of the corresponding laminates, their characteristic length scale is
determined by the mesostructural scale and the stress amplitude, and they
mostly recover their shapes after collision with phase shift and a linear
relationship exists between their speed and amplitude. A theoretical
description approximating the shape, length scale and speed of these high
amplitude dissipative pulses was proposed based on the Korteweg de Vries type
equation with a dispersive term dictated by the mesostructure. The nonlinear
term is derived from nonlinear constitutive equations of Aluminum and Tungsten,

strongly forward scattered light in Cassini ISS images. We model the plume as a
combination of spherical particles and irregular aggregates resulting from the
coagulation of spherical monomers, the latter of which allows for plumes of
lower particulate mass. Though a continuum of solutions are permitted by the
model, the best fits to the ISS data consist either of low mass plumes composed
entirely of small aggregates or high mass plumes composed of mostly spheres.
The high particulate mass plumes have total particulate masses of (166 $\pm$

plume. If indeed the plumes are made of such aggregates, then a vapor-based
origin for the plume particles cannot be ruled out. Finally, we show that the
residence time of the monomers inside the plume vents is sufficiently long for
Brownian coagulation to form the aggregates before they are ejected to space.

appropriate for assessing filtering stages, since the output is a set of
documents, rather than an ordered sequence of documents. Instead, we use an
approach in which a quality score is computed based on the discrepancy between
filtered and full evaluation. Unlike previous approaches, our methods do not
require relevance judgments, and thus can be used with virtually any query set.
We show that this quality score directly correlates with actual differences in
measured effectiveness when relevance judgments are available. Since the
quality score does not require relevance judgments, it can be used to identify
queries that perform particularly poorly for a given filter. Using these
methods, we explore a wide range of filtering options using thousands of
queries, categorize the relative merits of the different approaches, and
identify useful parameter combinations.

iterative algorithm in which an equation including only one variable is chosen
at each step, and the variable is fixed to the value satisfying the equation.
The dynamics of this algorithm is captured by the peeling algorithm. Analyses
of the peeling algorithm on random hypergraphs are required for many problems,
e.g., the decoding threshold of low-density parity check codes, the inverting
threshold of Goldreich's pseudorandom generator, the load threshold of cuckoo
hashing, etc. In this work, we deal with random hypergraphs including
superlinear number of hyperedges, and derive the tight threshold for the
succeeding of the peeling algorithm. For the analysis, Wormald's method of
differential equations, which is commonly used for analyses of the peeling
algorithm on random hypergraph with linear number of hyperedges, cannot be used
due to the superlinear number of hyperedges. A new method called the evolution
of the moment generating function is proposed in this work.

photodetector and high sampling rate are needed, but also a very stable
interferometer is required. A practical interferometer with active feedback
instead of common temperature control is developed to meet requirement of
stability. Phase fluctuations of the laser are measured by the interferometer
with a photodetector, and then digitalized to raw random numbers with a rate of
80 Gbps. The min-entropy of the raw data is evaluated by modeling the system

be removed by Toeplitz-matrix hashing randomness extraction. The final random

cosmology and is also a candidate for resolving the dark matter problem. I
demonstrate that, assuming reasonable scaling relations, massive gravity can

is known to remove the need for particle dark matter from galactic dynamics.
Milgrom's law comes with a characteristic acceleration, Milgrom's constant,
which is observationally constrained to $a_0\approx1.1\times10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$.
In the derivation presented here, this constant arises naturally from the
cosmologically required mass of gravitons like $a_0\propto
c\sqrt{\Lambda}\propto c H_0\sqrt{3\Omega_{\Lambda}}$, with $\Lambda$, $H_0$,
and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ being the cosmological constant, the Hubble constant,

the fastest, the cheapest way to complete a task. This report explores the two
pillars of optimal control, Bellman's Dynamic Programming and Pontryagin's
Maximum Principle, and compares implementations of both theories onto simulated
systems. Dynamic Programming is realized through a Differential Dynamic
Programming Algorithm, where utilizes a forward-backward pass to iteratively
optimize a control sequence and trajectory. The Maximum Principle is realized
via Gauss Pseudospectral Optimal Control, where the optimal control problem is
first approximated through polynomial basis functions, then solved, with
optimality being achieved through the costate equations of the Maximum
Principle. The results of the report show that, for short time Horizons, DDP
can optimize quickly and can generate a trajectory that utilizes less control
effort for the same problem formulation. On the other hand Pseudospectral
methods can optimize faster for longer time horizons, but require a key
understanding of the problem structure. Future work involves completing an
implementation of DDP in a C++ code, and testing the speed of convergence for
both methods, as well as extended the Pseudospectral Optimal Control framework
in to the world of stochastic optimal control.

for solving a class of high-dimensional convex composite conic optimization
problems to moderate accuracy. The design of this method combines an inexact
2-block majorized semi-proximal ADMM and the recent advances in the inexact
symmetric Gauss-Seidel (sGS) technique for solving a multi-block convex
composite quadratic programming whose objective contains a nonsmooth term
involving only the first block-variable. One distinctive feature of our
proposed method (the sGS-imsPADMM) is that it only needs one cycle of an
inexact sGS method, instead of an unknown number of cycles, to solve each of
the subproblems involved.With some simple and implementable error tolerance
criteria, the cost for solving the subproblems can be greatly reduced, and many
steps in the forward sweep of each sGS cycle can often be skipped, which
further contributes to the efficiency of the proposed method. Global
convergence as well as the iteration complexity in the non-ergodic sense is
established.Preliminary numerical experiments on some high-dimensional linear
and convex quadratic SDP problems with a large number of linear equality and
inequality constraints are also provided. The results show that for the vast
majority of the tested problems, the sGS-imsPADMM is 2 to 3 times faster than
the directly extended multi-block ADMM with the aggressive step-length of
1.618, which is currently the benchmark among first-order methods for solving
multi-block linear and quadratic SDP problems though its convergence is not
guaranteed.

this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped

This definition has several other natural interpretations. From the perspective

uniform density of distinguishable models in parameter space. Finally we
demonstrate the the $w$-prior is equivalent to the Akaike Information Criterion

generically applicable to statistical inference and is free of {\it ad hoc}

Lagrangian duality is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given

probabilistically grounded and has the advantage of leading to an optimization
problem with quadratic objective. The second contribution is the derivation of
the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem. The SLAM dual problem is a (convex)
semidefinite program, which can be solved reliably and globally by
off-the-shelf solvers. The third contribution is to discuss the relation
between the original SLAM problem and its dual. We show that from the dual
problem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a
candidate SLAM solution, and ultimately provide a certificate of optimality.
Moreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal
SLAM solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization. We
present extensive (real and simulated) experiments supporting our claims and
discuss practical relevance and open problems.

processing in wireless networks. As the network density is expected to
drastically increase in order to accommodate the exponentially growing mobile
data traffic, performance optimization problems are entering a new era
characterized by a high dimension and/or a large number of constraints, which
poses significant design and computational challenges. In this paper, we
present a novel two-stage approach to solve large-scale convex optimization
problems for dense wireless cooperative networks, which can effectively detect
infeasibility and enjoy modeling flexibility. In the proposed approach, the
original large-scale convex problem is transformed into a standard cone
programming form in the first stage via matrix stuffing, which only needs to
copy the problem parameters such as channel state information (CSI) and
quality-of-service (QoS) requirements to the pre-stored structure of the
standard form. The capability of yielding infeasibility certificates and
enabling parallel computing is achieved by solving the homogeneous self-dual
embedding of the primal-dual pair of the standard form. In the solving stage,
the operator splitting method, namely, the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), is adopted to solve the large-scale homogeneous self-dual
embedding. Compared with second-order methods, ADMM can solve large-scale
problems in parallel with modest accuracy within a reasonable amount of time.
Simulation results will demonstrate the speedup, scalability, and reliability
of the proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art modeling
frameworks and solvers.

particularly that of the iron lines from neutral and highly ionized atoms, is a
superposition of many cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries. In
this scenario, the flux should symmetrically distribute between the east and
west on the plane with respect to Sagittarius A$^*$ because the stellar mass
distribution determined by infrared observations is nearly symmetric. This
symmetry is confirmed for the highly ionized iron line as well as the continuum
emission. However, a clear excess of the neutral iron line in the near east of
the Galactic center compared to the near-west side is found. The flux
distribution of the excess emission well correlates with molecular column
density. The X-ray spectrum of the excess emission is described by a power-law
continuum plus a 6.4 keV line with the large equivalent width of $\sim1.3$ keV,
which is hardly explained by the low-energy electron bombardment scenario. The
longitudinal and latitudinal distribution of the excess emission disfavors the
X-ray irradiation, neither by Sagittarius A$^*$ nor by nearby X-ray binaries.

convex optimization problem expressed in a form natural and convenient for the
user into an equivalent cone program in a way that preserves fast linear
transforms in the original problem. By representing linear functions in the
transformation process not as matrices, but as graphs that encode composition
of linear operators, we arrive at a matrix-free cone program, i.e., one whose
data matrix is represented by a linear operator and its adjoint. This cone
program can then be solved by a matrix-free cone solver. By combining the

increased our understanding of how social networks relate to their physical

clustering of network communities, have not yet been systematically tested at
different scales. In this work we analyze the social network structure of over
25 million phone users from three countries at three different scales: country,
provinces and cities. We consistently find that this last urban scenario
presents significant differences to common knowledge about social networks.
First, the emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled
by whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost
independently of the population or geographic extension of the city. Second,
urban communities are much less geographically clustered than expected. These
two findings shed new light on the widely-studied searchability in
self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of decentralized search
strategies we conclude that urban networks are searchable not through
geographical proximity as their country-wide counterparts, but through an
homophily-driven community structure.

correlation for red clump stars between the two databases, and scatters around
the calibrations of red giant stars are substantial. We found two main sources
of the scatters of logg for red giant stars. One is a group of stars with
$0.00253*Teff-8.67<logg<2.6 locating at the forbidden region, and the other is
the contaminated red clump stars, which could be picked out from the unmatched
region where stellar metallicity is not consistent with the position in the

established two calibrations for red giant stars,
logg_APO=0.000615*Teff_LAMO+0.697*logg_LAMO-2.208$ (sigma=0.150) for [Fe/H]>-1

future, a civilization can increase its collective life expectancy, defined as
the average time after which the last settlement disappears due to vacuum
decay. We study in detail the collective life expectancy of two comoving
objects in de Sitter space as a function of the initial separation, the horizon
radius and the vacuum decay rate. We find that even with a modest initial
separation, the collective life expectancy can reach a value close to the
maximum possible value of 1.5 times that of the individual object if the decay
rate is less than 1% of the expansion rate. Our analysis can be generalized to
any number of objects, general trajectories not necessarily at rest in the
comoving coordinates and general FRW space-time. As part of our analysis we
find that in the current state of the universe dominated by matter and
cosmological constant, the vacuum decay rate is increasing as a function of
time due to accelerated expansion of the volume of the past light cone. Present
decay rate is about 3.7 times larger than the average decay rate in the past
and the final decay rate in the cosmological constant dominated epoch will be
about 56 times larger than the average decay rate in the past. This
considerably weakens the lower bound on the half-life of our universe based on

with redefining the inner product of states in Hilbert space to take care of
the restriction imposed by the (rectangle-tiled) checkerboard partition. The
resultant correlation matrix contains the coupling constants between states of
different guiding centers parameterized by magnetic length and the period of

$\Phi=2\pi$, or $\nu=2$ and $\Phi=\pi$, one Dirac band crossing is found. For
$\nu=1$ and $\Phi=\pi$, the band crossings are in the form of nodal line,
enclosing the Brillouin zone. As for $\nu=2$ and $\Phi=2\pi$, the doubled Dirac
point, or the quadratic point, is seen. Besides, we infer that the quadratic
point is protected by C$_4$ symmetry of the checkerboard partition since it
evolves into two separate Dirac points when the symmetry is lowered to C$_2$.
In addition, we also identify the emerging symmetries responsible for the
symmetric bulk entanglement spectra, which are absent in the underlying quantum

lower bound provided by Anantharam et al. (1987). Therefore, MP-TS is the first

out-of-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJ) has been theoretically
analyzed using the transformed Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation with the STT
terms. It is demonstrated that in a pMTJ structure obeying macrospin dynamics,
the out-of-plane torque influences the precession frequency but it does not
contribute significantly to the STT switching process (in particular to the
switching time and switching current density), which is mostly determined by
the in-plane STT contribution. This conclusion is confirmed by finite
temperature and finite writing pulse macrospin simulations of the current-field
switching diagrams. It contrasts with the case of STT-switching in in-plane
magnetized MTJ in which the field-like term also influences the switching
critical current. This theoretical analysis was successfully applied to the
interpretation of voltage-field STT switching diagrams experimentally measured
on perpendicular MTJ pillars 36 nm in diameter, which exhibit macrospin-like
behavior. The physical nonequivalence of Landau and Gilbert dissipation terms

a transmission electron microscope. In stead of writing the scattering
amplitude in Fourier space as a set of plane waves, we use the cylindrical
Fourier transform to describe the scattering amplitude in a basis of orbital
angular momentum (OAM) eigenstates. We show how working in this framework can
be very convenient when investigating e.g. rotation and screw axis symmetries.
For the latter we find selection rules on the OAM-coefficients that
unambiguously reveal the handedness of the screw axis. Detecting the
OAM-coefficients of the scattering amplitude thus offers the possibility to
detect the handedness of crystals without the need for dynamical simulations,
the thickness of the sample nor the exact crystal structure. We propose an
experimental setup to measure the OAM-components where an image of the crystal
is taken after inserting a spiral phase plate in the diffraction plane and
perform mulsti-slice simulations on $\alpha$-quartz to demonstrate how the
method indeed reveals the chirality. Experimental feasibility of the technique
is discussed together with its main advantages with respect to chirality
determination of screw axes. The method shows how the use of a spiral phase
plate can be extended from a simple phase imaging technique to a tool to
measure the local OAM-decomposition of an electron wave, widening the field of
interest well beyond chiral space group determination.

the different demands of several users, each of whom is assumed to have some
prior information on the data held by the sender. If the sender knows its
clients' requests and their side-information sets, then the number of packet
transmissions required to satisfy all users' demands can be greatly reduced if
the data is encoded before sending. The collection of side-information indices
as well as the indices of the requested data is described as an instance of the
index coding with side-information (ICSI) problem. The encoding function is
called the index code of the instance, and the number of transmissions employed
by the code is referred to as its length. The main ICSI problem is to determine
the optimal length of an index code for and instance. As this number is hard to
compute, bounds approximating it are sought, as are algorithms to compute
efficient index codes. Two interesting generalizations of the problem that have
appeared in the literature are the subject of this work. The first of these is
the case of index coding with coded side information, in which linear
combinations of the source data are both requested by and held as users'
side-information. The second is the introduction of error-correction in the
problem, in which the broadcast channel is subject to noise.
  In this paper we characterize the optimal length of a scalar or vector linear
index code with coded side information (ICCSI) over a finite field in terms of
a generalized min-rank and give bounds on this number based on constructions of
random codes for an arbitrary instance. We furthermore consider the length of
an optimal error correcting code for an instance of the ICCSI problem and
obtain bounds on this number, both for the Hamming metric and for rank-metric
errors. We describe decoding algorithms for both categories of errors.

consistent with the scenario that the flare was due to an outburst of a
low-mass X-ray binary that contains a stellar-mass black hole emitting near its
Eddington limit at the peak. However, it cannot be ruled out that the sudden
brightening in the nucleus was due to accretion onto a possible low-mass
nuclear black hole, fed by a tidally disrupted star or a gas cloud; the MAXI

when the rate of speech (ROS) is too low or too high. Most of present
approaches to addressing the ROS variation focus on the change of speech
signals in dynamic properties caused by ROS, and accordingly modify the dynamic
model, e.g., the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model (HMM).
However, an abnormal ROS changes not only the dynamic but also the static
property of speech signals, and thus can not be compensated for purely by
modifying the dynamic model. This paper proposes an ROS learning approach based
on deep neural networks (DNN), which involves an ROS feature as the input of
the DNN model and so the spectrum distortion caused by ROS can be learned and
compensated for. The experimental results show that this approach can deliver
better performance for too slow and too fast utterances, demonstrating our
conjecture that ROS impacts both the dynamic and the static property of speech.
In addition, the proposed approach can be combined with the conventional HMM
transition adaptation method, offering additional performance gains.

  The main novelty of the problem under consideration resides in the
non-trivial grouping of the densities: in particular, we assume that the
interaction parameters $a_{ij}$ are only non-negative, and thus may vanish for
specific couples $(i,j)$. As a main consequence, in the limit $\beta \to
+\infty$, densities do not segregate pairwise in general, but are grouped in
classes which, in turn, form a mutually disjoint partition. Moreover, with
respect to the literature, we consider more general forcing terms,
sign-changing solutions, and an arbitrary $p>0$. In addition, we present a
regularity theory of the emerging free-boundary, defined by the interface among
different segregated groups.
  These equations are very common in the study of Bose-Einstein condensates and
are of key importance for the analysis of optimal partition problems related to
high order eigenvalues.

spectral properties of the dynamics of market data. After choosing an optimal
size for a rolling window, the historical market data in this window is seen
every trading day as a random matrix from which a covariance and a correlation
matrix are obtained. The financial crisis indicators that we have built deal
with the spectral properties of these covariance and correlation matrices and
they are of two kinds. The first one is based on the Hellinger distance,
computed between the distribution of the eigenvalues of the empirical
covariance matrix and the distribution of the eigenvalues of a reference
covariance matrix representing either a calm or agitated market. The idea
behind this first type of indicators is that when the empirical distribution of
the spectrum of the covariance matrix is deviating from the reference in the
sense of Hellinger, then a crisis may be forthcoming. The second type of
indicators is based on the study of the spectral radius and the trace of the
covariance and correlation matrices as a mean to directly study the volatility
and correlations inside the market. The idea behind the second type of
indicators is the fact that large eigenvalues are a sign of dynamic
instability. The predictive power of the financial crisis indicators in this
framework is then demonstrated, in particular by using them as decision-making
tools in a protective-put strategy.

of consistently estimating the autocovariance sequence; this is a sequence of
matrices that we conveniently stack into one huge matrix. We are then able to
show consistency of an estimator based on the so-called flat-top tapers; most
importantly, the consistency holds true even when the time series dimension is
allowed to increase with the sample size. Second, we revisit the linear process
bootstrap (LPB) procedure proposed by McMurry and Politis [J. Time Series Anal.

stacked autocovariance matrix estimator, we are able to define a version of the
LPB that is valid for multivariate time series. Under rather general
assumptions, we show that our multivariate linear process bootstrap (MLPB) has
asymptotic validity for the sample mean in two important cases: (a) when the
time series dimension is fixed and (b) when it is allowed to increase with

spectral density estimators which is a novel result even in the univariate

analyse spectra and channel maps for TiO$_2$ extracted from ALMA science

the emission for the first time. The maps demonstrate a highly clumpy,
anisotropic outflow in which the TiO$_2$ emission likely traces gas exposed to
the stellar radiation field. A roughly east-west oriented, accelerating
bipolar-like structure is found, of which the blue component runs into and
breaks up around a solid continuum component. A distinct tail to the south-west
is seen for some transitions, consistent with features seen in the optical and

report of an event (such as 9/11 terroristic attack) represented as a series of
individual strings of information denoted respectively by two-state variable
Ei=+/-1, i=1,..., N. Assigning Ei value to all strings, the initial order
parameter and entropy are determined. Conspiracy theorists comment on the
report, focusing repeatedly on several strings Ek and changing their meaning
(from -1 to +1). The reading of the event is turned fuzzy with an increased
entropy value. Beyond some threshold value of entropy, chosen by simplicity to
its maximum value, meaning N/2 variables with Ei=1, doubt prevails in the
reading of the event and the chance is created that an alternative theory might
prevail. Therefore, the evolution of the associated entropy is a way to measure
the degree of penetration of a conspiracy theory. Our general framework relies
on online content made voluntarily available by crowds of people, in response
to some news or blog articles published by official news agencies. We apply
different aggregation levels (comment, person, discussion thread) and discuss

component of the system, which calculates the temporal evolution of the SEP

To achieve this, we performed numerical simulations of SEP transport in
interplanetary space, in which interplanetary SEP transport is described by the
focused transport equation. We developed a new simulation code to solve the
equation using a set of stochastic differential equations. In the code, the
focused transport equation is expressed in a magnetic field line coordinate
system, which is a non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. An inverse
Gaussian distribution is employed as the injection profile of SEPs at an inner
boundary located near the Sun. We applied the simulation to observed SEP events
as a validation test. The results show that our simulation can closely
reproduce observational data for the temporal evolution of particle intensity.

information in a network, in each time unit, every node $u$ is allowed to
contact a single random neighbor $v$. If $u$ knows the data (rumor) to be
disseminated, it disperses it to $v$ (known as PUSH) and if it does not, it
requests it from $v$ (known as PULL). While in the classic gossip model, each
node is only allowed to contact a single neighbor in each time unit, each node
can possibly be contacted by many neighboring nodes.
  In the present paper, we consider a restricted model where at each node only
one incoming request can be served. As long as only a single piece of
information needs to be disseminated, this does not make a difference for push
requests. It however has a significant effect on pull requests. In the paper,
we therefore concentrate on this weaker pull version, which we call 'restricted
pull'.
  We distinguish two versions of the restricted pull protocol depending on
whether the request to be served among a set of pull requests at a given node
is chosen adversarially or uniformly at random. As a first result, we prove an
exponential separation between the two variants. We show that there are
instances where if an adversary picks the request to be served, the restricted
pull protocol requires a polynomial number of rounds whereas if the winning
request is chosen uniformly at random, the restricted pull protocol only
requires a polylogarithmic number of rounds to inform the whole network.
Further, as the main technical contribution, we show that if the request to be
served is chosen randomly, the slowdown of using restricted pull versus using
the classic pull protocol can w.h.p. be upper bounded by $O(\Delta / \delta
\log n)$, where $\Delta$ and $\delta$ are the largest and smallest degree of
the network.

$p_1(x),\ldots,p_n(x)$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$, be a basis of algebraically
independent $W$-invariant real homogeneous polynomials. The orbit map
$\overline p:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n:x\to (p_1(x),\ldots,p_n(x))$ induces a
diffeomorphism between the orbit space $\mathbb{R}^n/W$ and the set ${\cal
S}=\overline p(\mathbb{R}^n)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. The border of ${\cal S}$ is
the $\overline p$ image of the set of reflecting hyperplanes of $W$. With a
given basic set of invariant polynomials it is possible to build an $n\times n$
polynomial matrix, $\widehat P(p)$, $p\in\mathbb{R}^n$, sometimes called
$\widehat P$-matrix, such that $\widehat P_{ab}(p(x))=\nabla p_a(x)\cdot \nabla
p_b(x)$, $\forall\,a,b=1,\ldots,n$. The border of ${\cal S}$ is contained in
the algebraic surface $\det(\widehat P(p))=0$, sometimes called discriminant,
and the polynomial $\det(\widehat P(p))$ satisfies a system of differential
equations that depends on an $n$-dimensional polynomial vector $\lambda(p)$.
Possible applications concern phase transitions and singularities. If the rank
$n$ is large, the matrix $\widehat P(p)$ is in general difficult to calculate.
In this article I suggest a choice of the basic invariant polynomials for all
the reflection groups of type $S_n$, $A_n$, $B_n$, $D_n$, $\forall\,n\in
\mathbb{N}$, for which I give generating formulas for the corresponding
$\widehat P$-matrices and $\lambda$-vectors. These $\widehat P$-matrices can be
written, almost completely, as sums of block Hankel matrices. Transformation
formulas allow to determine easily both the $\widehat P$-matrix and the
$\lambda$-vector in any other basis of invariant polynomials. Examples of
transformations into flat bases, $a$-bases, and canonical bases, are
considered.

traditional frequentists' approach to quantile regression has been well
developed around asymptotic theories and efficient algorithms. However, not
much work has been published under the Bayesian framework. One challenging
problem for Bayesian quantile regression is that the full likelihood has no
parametric forms. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian quantile regression
method, the linearly interpolated density (LID) method, which uses a linear
interpolation of the quantiles to approximate the likelihood. Unlike most of
the existing methods that aim at tackling one quantile at a time, our proposed
method estimates the joint posterior distribution of multiple quantiles,
leading to higher global efficiency for all quantiles of interest. Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithms are developed to carry out the proposed method. We
provide convergence results that justify both the algorithmic convergence and
statistical approximations to an integrated-likelihood-based posterior. From
the simulation results, we verify that LID has a clear advantage over other
existing methods in estimating quantities that relate to two or more quantiles.

features of realistic calculation within the quasiparticle random-phase
approximation with isospin symmetry restoration concerning the dependence of
the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay matrix elements on isovector and
isoscalar particle-particle interactions. By using perturbation theory an
explicit dependence of the two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay matrix elements on
the like-nucleon pairing, particle-particle T=0 and T=1, and particle-hole
proton-neutron interactions is obtained. It is found that double-$\beta$ decay
matrix elements do not depend on the mean field part of Hamiltonian and that
they are governed by a weak violation of both SU(2) and SU(4) symmetries by the
particle-particle interaction of Hamiltonian. It is pointed out that there is a
dominance of two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay transition through a single
state of intermediate nucleus. The energy position of this state relative to
energies of initial and final ground states is given by a combination of
strengths of residual interactions. Further, energy-weighted Fermi and
Gamow-Teller sum rules connecting Delta Z = 2 nuclei are discussed. It is
proposed that these sum rules can be used to study the residual interactions of
the nuclear Hamiltonian, which are relevant for charge-changing nuclear

of stable pairs on abelian surfaces by G\""ottsche-Shende. A formula for
hyperelliptic curve counting in terms of Jacobi forms is proven (modulo a
transversality statement).
  For abelian threefolds, complete conjectures in terms of Jacobi forms for the
generating series of curve counts in primitive classes are presented. The base
cases make connections to classical lattice counts of Debarre, Goettsche, and
Lange-Sernesi. Further evidence is provided by Donaldson-Thomas partition
function computations for abelian threefolds. A multiple cover structure is
presented. The abelian threefold conjectures open a new direction in the
subject.

of uniqueness and stability in piecewise smooth dynamical systems. When a
vector field is discontinuous at some hypersurface, it can become tangent to
that surface from one side or the other, and tangency from both sides creates a
two-fold singularity. The local flow bears a superficial resemblance to
so-called {\it folded singularities} in (smooth) slow-fast systems, which arise
at the intersection of attractive and repelling branches of slow invariant
manifolds, important in the local study of canards and mixed mode oscillations.
Here we show that these two singularities are intimately related. When the
discontinuity in a piecewise smooth system is regularized (smoothed out) at a
two-fold singularity, the resulting system can be mapped onto a folded
singularity. The result is not obvious since it requires the presence of
nonlinear or `hidden' terms at the discontinuity, which turn out to be
necessary for structural stability of the regularization (or smoothing) of the
discontinuity, and necessary for mapping to the folded singularity.

question. Their observations in galaxies suggest strong magnetic fields already
at high redshift as well as at present time. However, neither primordial
magnetic fields nor battery processes can account for such high field
strengths, which implies the presence of a dynamo process with rapid growth
rates in high-redshift galaxies and subsequent maintenance against decay. We
investigate the particular role played by feedback mechanisms in creating
strong fluid turbulence, allowing for a magnetic dynamo to emerge. Performing
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated cooling gas halos, we compare the
magnetic field evolution for various initial field topologies and various
stellar feedback mechanisms. We find that feedback can indeed drive strong gas
turbulence and dynamo action. We see typical properties of Kolmogorov
turbulence with a $k^{-5/3}$ kinetic energy spectrum, as well as a small-scale
dynamo, with a $k^{3/2}$ magnetic energy spectrum predicted by Kazantsev dynamo
theory. We also investigate simulations with a final quiescent phase. As
turbulence decreases, the galactic fountain settles into a thin, rotationally
supported disk. The magnetic field develops a large-scale, well-ordered
structure with even symmetry, which is in good agreement with magnetic field
observations of nearby spirals. Our findings suggest that weak initial seed
fields were first amplified by a small-scale dynamo during a violent,
feedback-dominated early phase in the galaxy formation history, followed by a
more quiescent evolution, where the fields have slowly decayed or were
maintained via large-scale dynamo action.

know only the size of the network $n$, the maximum in-degree of any node
$\Delta$, and the eccentricity of the network $D$.
  For such networks, we first give an algorithm for wake-up, based on the
existence of small universal synchronizers. This algorithm runs in
$O(\frac{\min\{n, D \Delta\} \log n \log \Delta}{\log\log \Delta})$ time, the
fastest known in both directed and undirected networks, improving over the
previous best $O(n \log^2n)$-time result across all ranges of parameters, but
particularly when maximum in-degree is small.
  Next, we introduce a new combinatorial framework of block synchronizers and
prove the existence of such objects of low size. Using this framework, we
design a new deterministic algorithm for the fundamental problem of
broadcasting, running in $O(n \log D \log\log\frac{D \Delta}{n})$ time. This is
the fastest known algorithm for the problem in directed networks, improving
upon the $O(n \log n \log \log n)$-time algorithm of De Marco (2010) and the

not only the energies but also the lifetimes of the states of the system. They
show a non-analytical behavior at singular (exceptional) points (EPs). The
eigenfunctions are biorthogonal, in contrast to the orthogonal eigenfunctions
of a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure for the ratio between
biorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity of the wavefunctions.
At and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum value. The lifetimes of
two nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate under the influence of an
EP. When the parameters are tuned to the point of maximum width bifurcation,
the phase rigidity suddenly increases up to its maximum value. This means that
the eigenfunctions become almost orthogonal at this point. This unexpected
result is very robust as shown by numerical results for different classes of
systems. Physically, it causes an irreversible stabilization of the system by
creating local structures that can be described well by a Hermitian Hamilton
operator. Interesting non-trivial features of open quantum systems appear in
the parameter range in which a clustering of EPs causes a dynamical phase
transition.

language to model other types of data such as images and events. In this paper
we propose a representation framework of stochastic AOGs that is agnostic to
the type of the data being modeled and thus unifies various domain-specific
AOGs. Many existing grammar formalisms and probabilistic models in natural
language processing, computer vision, and machine learning can be seen as
special cases of this framework. We also propose a domain-independent inference
algorithm of stochastic context-free AOGs and show its tractability under a
reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we provide two interpretations of
stochastic context-free AOGs as a subset of probabilistic logic, which connects
stochastic AOGs to the field of statistical relational learning and clarifies
their relation with a few existing statistical relational models.

space of many extensions of the SM. However, there is still room for very large
CP-odd Yukawa couplings to light quarks and leptons while the top-quark Yukawa
coupling is already very constrained by current data. Although indirect
measurements of electric dipole moments play a very important role in
constraining the pseudo-scalar components of the Yukawa couplings, we argue
that a direct measurement of the ratio of pseudoscalar to scalar couplings
should be one of the top priorities for the LHC run 2.

stochastic, zero-mean fluctuations of the $\alpha$ parameter. Particularly
interesting is the possibility of the growth of the mean magnetic field due to
Moffatt drift, which is expected to be finite in a statistically anisotropic
turbulence. We extend the Kraichnan-Moffatt model to explore effects of finite
memory of $\alpha$ fluctuations, in a spirit similar to that of Sridhar & Singh
(2014), hereafter SS14. Using the first-order smoothing approximation, we
derive a linear integro-differential equation governing the dynamics of the
large-scale magnetic field, which is non-perturbative in the
$\alpha$-correlation time $\tau_{\alpha}$. We recover earlier results in the
exactly solvable white-noise (WN) limit where the Moffatt drift does not
contribute to the dynamo growth/decay. To study finite memory effects, we
reduce the integro-differential equation to a partial differential equation by
assuming that the $\tau_{\alpha}$ be small but nonzero and the large-scale
magnetic field is slowly varying. We derive the dispersion relation and provide
explicit expression for the growth rate as a function of four independent
parameters. When $\tau_{\alpha}\neq 0$, we find that: (i) in the absence of the
Moffatt drift, but with finite Kraichnan diffusivity, only strong
$\alpha$-fluctuations can enable a mean-field dynamo; (ii) in the general case
when also the Moffatt drift is nonzero, both, weak or strong $\alpha$
fluctuations, can lead to a large-scale dynamo; and (iii) there always exists a
wavenumber ($k$) cutoff at some large $k$ beyond which the growth rate turns
negative. Thus we show that a finite Moffatt drift can always facilitate
large-scale dynamo action if sufficiently strong, even in case of weak $\alpha$
fluctuations, and the maximum growth occurs at intermediate wavenumbers.

instability (DDI) of constant stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion

around that equilibrium. In this paper we show that coupling reaction-diffusion
equations with ordinary differential equations (ODE) may lead to a novel
pattern formation phenomenon in which DDI causes destabilization of both
constant solutions and Turing patterns. Bistability and hysteresis effects in
the null sets of model nonlinearities yield formation of far from the
equilibrium patterns with jump discontinuity. We derive conditions for
stability of stationary solutions with jump discontinuity in a suitable
topology which allows disclosing the discontinuity points and leads to the
definition of ({\epsilon}0 , A)-stability. Additionally, we provide conditions
on stability of patterns in a quasi-stationary model reduction. The analysis is
illustrated on the example of three-component model of receptor-ligand binding.
The proposed model provides an example of a mechanism of de novo formation of
far from the equilibrium patterns in reaction-diffusion-ODE models involving
co-existence of DDI and hysteresis.

the rotation of the quantum vacuum together with the Universe. Whether one can
detect the rotation of the vacuum or not depends on its properties. If the
vacuum is fully relativistic at all scales, Mach's principle should work and
one cannot distinguish the rotation: in the rotating Universe+vacuum, the
co-rotating bucket will have a flat surface (not concave). However, if there
are ""quantum gravity"" effects which violate Lorentz invariance at high energy,
then the rotation will become observable. This is demonstrated by analogy in
condensed-matter systems, which consist of two subsystems: superfluid
background (analog of vacuum) and ""relativistic"" excitations (analog of
matter). For the low-energy (long-wavelength) observer the rotation of the
vacuum is not observable. In the rotating frame, the ""relativistic""
quasiparticles feel the background as a Minkowski vacuum, i.e. they do not feel
the rotation. Mach's idea of the relativity of rotational motion does indeed
work for them. But rotation becomes observable by high-energy observers, who
can see the quantum gravity effects.

is allowed to be distinct, we also consider partially heterogeneous coupling
and homogeneous coupling in which the coupling functions are either unique to
each oscillator or identical for all network interactions, respectively. We
demonstrate the validity of our theory with numerical simulations of multiple

  far-infrared image stacking analysis","8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel method to constrain the spatial extent of dust around
galaxies through the measurement of dust temperature. Our method combines the
dust emission of galaxies from far-infrared (FIR) image stacking analysis and
the quasar reddening due to the dust absorption around galaxies. As a specific
application of our method, we use the stacked FIR emission profiles of SDSS
photometric galaxies over the IRAS 100$\mu$m map, and the recent measurement of
the SDSS galaxy-quasar cross-correlation. If we adopt a single-temperature dust
model, the resulting temperature is around 18K, which is consistent with a
typical dust temperature for a central part of galaxies. If we assume an
additional dust component with much lower temperature, the current data imply
the temperature of the galactic dust needs to be higher, 20K to 30K. Since the
model of the density and temperature distribution of dust adopted in the
current paper is very simple, we cannot draw any strong conclusion at this
point. Nevertheless our novel method with the elaborated theoretical model and
multi-band measurement of dust will offer an interesting constraint on the
statistical nature of galactic dust.

observed for the first time. The $W\!+\!b$ final state with $W\to\mu\nu$ is
reconstructed using muons with a transverse momentum, $p_{\rm T}$, larger than
25 GeV in the pseudorapidity range $2.0<\eta<4.5$. The $b$ jets are required to
have $50 < p_{\rm T} < 100$ GeV and $2.2 < \eta < 4.2$, while the transverse
component of the sum of the muon and $b$-jet momenta must satisfy $p_{\rm T} >
20$ GeV. The results are based on data corresponding to integrated luminosities
of 1.0 and $2.0$ fb$^{-1}$ collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV
by LHCb. The inclusive top quark production cross-sections in the fiducial
region are $\sigma({\rm top})[7\rm{TeV}] = 239\pm53({\rm stat})\pm33({\rm

results, along with the observed differential yields and charge asymmetries,
are in agreement with next-to-leading order Standard Model predictions.

non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. As a model
system to study the transition from classical to quantum glassy dynamics, we
propose a setup of laser driven three-level atoms trapped in an optical
lattice. Tuning the strength of the laser driving to the intermediate level
allows one to study the transition from a classical Kinetically Constrained
Model to the coherent regime. For strong driving, Rydberg excitations evolve
analogously to defects in the One-Spin Facilitated Model, a minimal model known
to exhibit glassy dynamics. In our setup, the constraints result from the
interplay between Rydberg interactions and the laser detuning from the Rydberg
state. The emerging heterogeneous relaxation timescales are tuneable over
several orders of magnitudes. In the opposite limit of weak driving of the
intermediate level, we find an effective cluster model which describes the
dynamics in a reduced subspace of the allowed number and positions of Rydberg
excitations. This subspace is uniquely determined by the initial state and is
characterized by a fixed number of clusters of Rydberg excitations. In
addition, we investigate the influence of random fields on the classical
relaxation. We find that the glassy dynamics can relax faster in the presence
of weak random fields.

major challenge for seismic imaging and generally requires specialized
implementations to make full use of modern parallel architectures. We present a
computational strategy for reverse-time migration (RTM) with accelerator-aided
clusters. A new imaging condition computed from the pressure and velocity
fields is introduced. The model solver is based on a high-order discontinuous
Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method for the pressure-velocity system with
unstructured meshes and multi-rate local time-stepping. We adopted the MPI+X
approach for distributed programming where X is a threaded programming model.
In this work we chose OCCA, a unified framework that makes use of major
multi-threading languages (e.g. CUDA and OpenCL) and offers the flexibility to
run on several hardware architectures. DGTD schemes are suitable for efficient
computations with accelerators thanks to localized element-to-element coupling
and the dense algebraic operations required for each element. Moreover,
compared to high-order finite-difference schemes, the thin halo inherent to
DGTD method reduces the amount of data to be exchanged between MPI processes
and storage requirements for RTM procedures. The amount of data to be recorded
during simulation is reduced by storing only boundary values in memory rather
than on disk and recreating the forward wavefields. Computational results are
presented that indicate that these methods are strong scalable up to at least
32 GPUs for a three-dimensional RTM case.

O(2)- and O(4)-models. We also investigate the behavior of the critical

hypernuclei, quarkonia, etc., and is essential for understanding their
spectroscopic properties. Depending on the system, the effect of spin-orbit
coupling on shell structure is large in nuclei, small in quarkonia,
perturbative in atoms. In the standard non-relativistic reduction of the
single-particle Dirac equation, we derive a universal rule for the relative
magnitude of the spin-orbit effect that applies to very different quantum
systems, regardless of whether the spin-orbit coupling originates from the
strong or electromagnetic interaction. It is shown that in nuclei the near
equality of the mass of the nucleon and the difference between the large
repulsive and attractive potentials explains the fact that spin-orbit
splittings are comparable to the energy spacing between major shells. For a
specific ratio between the particle mass and the effective potential whose
gradient determines the spin-orbit force, we predict the occurrence of giant
spin-orbit energy splittings that dominate the single-particle excitation
spectrum.

depleted by prodigious atmospheric escape. We demonstrate that cometary impacts
could not have delivered enough N mass to resupply Pluto's N2 atmospheric
escape over time; thus Pluto's N2 is likely endogenous, and therefore was
either acquired early in its history or created by chemistry inside/on Pluto.
We find that cratering could excavate a considerable amount of N2 to resupply
the atmosphere against escape if the near-surface N2 reservoir is deep.
However, we find that this process likely falls short of that necessary to
resupply the atmosphere against escape by at least an order of magnitude. We
conclude that either the escape of N2 from Pluto's atmosphere was on average
much lower than the predictions for the current epoch, or that internal
activity could be necessary to bring N2 to the surface and resupply escape
losses. Observations made by the New Horizons spacecraft in mid-2015 will yield
further constraints on the provenance and evolution of Pluto's surface and

interactions in BEC we employed a method similar to that used in experimental
investigation of the interaction between solitons in optical fibers. The idea
consists in creating two solitons at some spatial separation from each other at
initial time $t_0$, and then measuring the distance between them at a later
time $t_1 > t_0$. Depending on whether the distance between solitons has
increased, decreased or remained unchanged, compared to its initial value at

$1\times10^{7}$ cm $^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at 1.5 K. Angle- and
temperature-dependent quantum oscillations, supported by density function
theory calculations, reveal that NbP has the coexistence of p- and n-type WSM
pockets in the $k_{z}$=1.16$\pi$/c plane (W1-WSM) and in the $k_{z}$=0 plane
near the high symmetry points $\Sigma$ (W2-WSM), respectively. Uniquely, each
W2-WSM pocket forms a large dumbbell-shaped Fermi surface (FS) enclosing two
neighboring Weyl nodes with the opposite chirality. The magneto-transport in
NbP is dominated by these highly anisotropic W2-WSM pockets, in which Weyl
fermions are well protected from defect backscattering by real spin
conservation associated to the chiral nodes. However, with a minimal doping of
$\sim$1\% Cr, the mobility of NbP is degraded by more than two order of
magnitude, due to the invalid of helicity protection to magnetic impurities.
Helicity protected Weyl fermion transport is also manifested in chiral anomaly
induced negative magnetoresistance, controlled by the W1-WSM states. In the
quantum regime below 10 K, the intervalley scattering time by impurities
becomes a large constant, producing the sharp and nearly identical conductivity
enhancement at low magnetic field.

formation computations performed on a CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical simulation of
the solar atmosphere. The oxygen abundances obtained from the forbidden line at
different limb angles are inconsistent if the commonly adopted nickel abundance
of 6.25 is assumed in our local thermodynamic equilibrium computations. With a
slightly lower nickel abundance, A(Ni)~6.1, we obtain consistent fits
indicating an oxygen abundance of A(O)=8.73+/-0.05. At this value the
discrepancy with the subordinate oxygen line remains. The derived value of the
oxygen abundance supports the notion of a rather low oxygen abundance in the
solar hotosphere. However, it is disconcerting that the forbidden oxygen lines
at 630 and 636nm give noticeably different results, and that the nickel
abundance derived here from the 630nm blend is lower than expected from other
nickel lines.

split-octonion geometry naturally exhibit properties from conventional
(3+1)-theory (e.g. number of dimensions, existence of maximal velocities,
Heisenberg uncertainty, particle generations, etc.). This paper demonstrates
these properties using an explicit representation of the automorphisms on
split-octonions, the noncompact form of the exceptional Lie group G2. This
group generates specific rotations of (3+4)-vector parts of split octonions
with three extra time-like coordinates and in infinitesimal limit imitate
standard Poincare transformations. In this picture translations are represented
by non-compact Lorentz-type rotations towards the extra time-like coordinates.
It is shown how the G2 algebra's chirality yields an intrinsic left-right
asymmetry of a certain 3-vector (spin), as well as a parity violating effect on
light emitted by a moving quantum system. Elementary particles are connected
with the special elements of the algebra which nullify octonionic intervals.
Then the zero-norm conditions lead to free particle Lagrangians, which allow
virtual trajectories also and exhibit the appearance of spatial horizons
governing by mass parameters.

  equivalence by the hidden dynamics approach","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1506.00845",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The {\it two-fold singularity} has played a significant role in our
understanding of uniqueness and stability in piecewise smooth dynamical
systems. When a vector field is discontinuous at some hypersurface, it can
become tangent to that surface from one side or the other, and tangency from
both sides creates a two-fold singularity. The flow this creates bears a
superficial resemblance to so-called {\it folded singularities} in (smooth)
slow-fast systems, which arise at the intersection of attractive and repelling
branches of slow invariant manifolds, important in the local study of canards
and mixed mode oscillations. Here we show that these two singularities are
intimately related. When the discontinuity in a piecewise smooth system is
blown up or smoothed out at a two-fold singularity, the resulting system can be
mapped onto a folded singularity. The result is not obvious, however, since it
requires the presence of nonlinear or `hidden' terms at the discontinuity,
which turn out to be necessary for structural stability of the blow up (or
smoothing), and necessary for mapping to the folded singularity.

contrary to the predictions of equilibrium statistical mechanics -- the flow
does not evolve into a large-scale steady state. Instead, significant
unsteadiness persists, characterised by a population of persistent small-scale
vortices interacting with a large-scale oscillating quadrupolar vorticity
field. Moreover, the vorticity develops a stepped, staircase distribution,
consisting of nearly homogeneous regions separated by sharp gradients. The
persistence of unsteadiness is explained by a simple point vortex model

element approximation of the underlying governing equations (both in the volume
and on its surface) and their solution using the open-source finite element
library deal.II. The fully-nonlinear (geometric and material) setting is
considered. The nonlinear problem is solved using a Newton--Raphson procedure
wherein the tangent contributions from the volume and surface are computed
exactly. The finite element formulation is implemented within the total
Lagrangian framework and a Bubnov-Galerkin spatial discretization of the volume
and the surface employed. The surface is assumed material. A map between the
degrees of freedom on the surface and on the boundary of the volume is used to
allocate the contribution from the surface to the global system matrix and
residual vector. The deal.II library greatly facilitates the computation of the
various surface operators, allowing the numerical implementation to closely
match the theory developed in a companion paper. Key features of the theory and
the numerical implementation are elucidated using a series of benchmark example
problems. The full, documented source code is provided.

symmetry. We propose that the Higgs boson be a dynamical bound state rather
than an elementary scalar, so that there is no quadratic divergence self-energy
problem for it and no need to invoke supersymmetry to resolve it. We study a
conformal invariant theory of interacting fermions and gauge bosons, in which
there is scaling with anomalous dimensions and dynamical symmetry breaking,
with the dynamical dimension of $\bar{\psi}\psi$ being reduced from 3 to 2.
With this reduction we augment the theory with a then renormalizable 4-fermion
interaction with dynamical dimension equal to 4. We reinterpret the theory as a
renormalizable version of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, with the gauge
theory sector with its now massive fermion being the mean field and the
4-fermion interaction being the residual interaction. It is this residual
interaction that generates dynamical Goldstone and Higgs states, states that,
as noted by Baker and Johnson, the gauge theory sector itself does not possess.
The Higgs boson is found to be a narrow resonance just above threshold. We
couple the theory to conformal gravity, with the interplay between conformal
gravity and the 4-fermion interaction taking care of the vacuum energy problem.
With conformal gravity being a consistent quantum gravity theory there is no
need for string theory with its supersymmetric underpinnings. With conformal
gravity fits to galactic rotation curves and the accelerating universe not
needing dark matter, there is no need to introduce supersymmetry for either the
vacuum energy problem or to provide a potential dark matter candidate. We
propose that it is conformal symmetry rather than supersymmetry that is
fundamental, with the theory of nature being a locally conformal, locally gauge
invariant, non-Abelian NJL theory.
