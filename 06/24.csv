dimensional spin polarized Fermi gas with Rashba spin-orbital-coupling (SOC).
At finite temperature, the effects of non-condensed pairs due to the thermal
excitation are considered based on the $G_0G$ pair fluctuation theory. These
fluctuations generate a pseudogap even persistent above $T_c$. Within this
framework, the Sarma state or the spin polarized superfluid state and polarized
pseudogap state are explored in detail. The resulting $T_c$ curves show that
the enhancement of pairing due to the SOC roughly cancels out the suppression
of pairing due to the population imbalance. Thus we observed that in a large
portion of the parameter space, the polarized superfluid state are stabilized
by the SOC.

through coarse graining of model simulations - finite state approximation of
statistical mechanical systems. Recent results concerning the convergence of
the statistical properties of finite state Markov approximation of the full
asymptotic dynamics on the SRB measure in the limit of finer and finer
partitions of the phase space are suggestive of some degree of robustness of
the obtained results in the case of Axiom A system. Our findings give closed
formulas for the linear and nonlinear response theory at all orders of
perturbation and provide matrix expressions that can be directly implemented in
any coding language, plus providing bounds on the radius of convergence of the
perturbative theory. In particular, we relate the convergence of the response
theory to the rate of mixing of the unperturbed system. One can use the
formulas obtained for finite state Markov processes to recover previous
findings obtained on the response of continuous time Axiom A dynamical systems
to perturbations, by considering the generator of time evolution for the
measure and for the observables. A very basic, low-tech, and computationally
cheap analysis of the response of the Lorenz '63 model to perturbations
provides rather encouraging results regarding the possibility of using the
approximate representation given by finite state Markov processes to compute
the system's response.

description of cohomology for Hilbert manifolds. Our model is Quillen's

definition of Gysin maps for ""oriented"" proper maps. For finite dimensional
manifolds one has a Gysin map in singular cohomology which is based on
Poincar\'e duality, hence it is not clear how to extend it to infinite
dimensional manifolds. But perhaps one can overcome this difficulty by giving a
Quillen type description of singular cohomology for Hilbert manifolds. This is
what we do in this paper. Besides constructing a general Gysin map, one of our
motivations was a geometric construction of equivariant cohomology, which even
for a point is the cohomology of the infinite dimensional space $BG$, which has
a Hilbert manifold model. Besides that, we demonstrate the use of such a
geometric description of cohomology by several other applications. We give a
quick description of characteristic classes of a finite dimensional vector
bundle and apply it to a generalized Steenrod representation problem for
Hilbert manifolds and define a notion of a degree of proper oriented Fredholm

well-studied problem. The fully dynamic version, in which edges are inserted
and deleted over time has also been the subject of much attention. Existing
algorithms for dynamic matching (in general graphs) seem to fall into two
groups: there are fast (mostly randomized) algorithms that do not achieve a
better than 2-approximation, and there slow algorithms with $\O(\sqrt{m})$
update time that achieve a better-than-2 approximation. Thus the obvious
question is whether we can design an algorithm -- deterministic or randomized
-- that achieves a tradeoff between these two: a $o(\sqrt{m})$ approximation
and a better-than-2 approximation simultaneously. We answer this question in
the affirmative for bipartite graphs.
  Our main result is a fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $3/2 + \eps$
approximation in worst-case update time $O(m^{1/4}\eps^{/2.5})$. We also give
stronger results for graphs whose arboricity is at most $\al$, achieving a $(1+
\eps)$ approximation in worst-case time $O(\al (\al + \log n))$ for constant
$\eps$. When the arboricity is constant, this bound is $O(\log n)$ and when the
arboricity is polylogarithmic the update time is also polylogarithmic.
  The most important technical developement is the use of an intermediate graph
we call an edge degree constrained subgraph (EDCS). This graph places
constraints on the sum of the degrees of the endpoints of each edge: upper
bounds for matched edges and lower bounds for unmatched edges. The main
technical content of our paper involves showing both how to maintain an EDCS
dynamically and that and EDCS always contains a sufficiently large matching. We
also make use of graph orientations to help bound the amount of work done
during each update.

dredge-up in the progenitor star of NGC 3918. We find that Kr is strongly
enriched in NGC 3918 and that Se is less enriched than Kr, in agreement with
the results of previous papers and with predicted s-process nucleosynthesis. We
also find that Xe is not as enriched by the s-process in NGC 3918 as is Kr and,
therefore, that neutron exposure is typical of modestly sub-solar metallicity
AGB stars. A clear correlation is found when representing [Kr/O] vs. log(C/O)
for NGC 3918 and other objects with detection of multiple ions of Kr in optical
data, confirming that carbon is brought to the surface of AGB stars along with
s-processed material during third dredge-up episodes, as predicted by
nucleosynthesis models. We also detect numerous refractory element lines (Ca,
K, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu). We compute physical conditions from a large
number of diagnostics. Thanks to the high ionization of NGC 3918 we detect a
large number of recombination lines of multiple ionization stages of C, N, O

state-of-the-art ICF schemes or simply adding ionic abundances are in very good

detecting and tracking near-Earth objects (NEOs). Detailed simulations of the
search performance of these systems have used complex computer codes that are
not widely available, which hinders accurate cross-comparison of the proposals
and obscures whether they have consistent assumptions. Moreover, some proposed
instruments would survey infrared (IR) bands, whereas others would operate in
the visible band, and differences among asteroid thermal and visible light
models used in the simulations further complicate like-to-like comparisons. I
use simple physical principles to estimate basic performance metrics for the
ground-based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and three space-based instruments
- Sentinel, NEOCam, and a Cubesat constellation. The performance is measured
against two different NEO distributions, the Bottke et al. distribution of
general NEOs, and the Veres et al. distribution of Earth impacting NEO. The
results of the comparison show simplified relative performance metrics,
including the expected number of NEOs visible in the search volumes and the
initial detection rates expected for each system. Although these simplified
comparisons do not capture all of the details, they give considerable insight
into the physical factors limiting performance. Multiple asteroid thermal
models are considered, including FRM, NEATM, and a new generalized form of FRM
(GFRM). I describe issues with how IR albedo and emissivity have been estimated
in previous studies, which may render them inaccurate. A thermal model for
tumbling asteroids is also developed and suggests that tumbling asteroids may
be surprisingly difficult for IR telescopes to observe.

to discover frequent patterns from small to large databases. This paper points
toward the inadequacy of the tangible Apriori algorithm of wasting time for
scanning the whole transactional database for discovering association rules and
proposes an enhancement on Apriori algorithm to overcome this problem. This
enhancement is obtained by dropping the amount of time used in scanning the
transactional database by just limiting the number of transactions while

also the full cosmological perturbation theory at early times. We find that
whilst the scalar mode behaves as one would expect, and the effects of
anisotropy at early times are sub-dominant to the late-time effects already
studied, for the tensor modes in fact the the early-time effects grow with
multipole and can become much larger than one would expect, even dominating

chromo-Rayleigh interactions. We point out that the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), as a gluon machine, provides a superb probe of such interactions. In
this paper, we introduce simplified models to UV-complete two effective dark
matter chromo-Rayleigh interactions and identify the corresponding collider
signatures, including four jets or a pair of di-jet resonances plus missing
transverse energy. After performing collider studies for both the 8 TeV and 14

chromo-Rayleigh interactions than direct detection experiments and thus
provides the best opportunity for future discovery of this class of models.

aim of unifying both approaches, we construct a 2+2 threading from the 1+3
flow, and thus isolate one prefered spatial direction, that allows
straightforward translation into a dual nul subbasis, and to deduce the
geometric apparatus that follows. We remain as general as possible, reverting
to spherical symmetry only when needed, and express the MTS conditions in terms
of 2-expansion of the flow, then in purely geometric form of the dual null
expansions. The Raychadhuri equations that describe both MTS and TH are written
and interpreted using the previously defined gTOV (generalized
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov) functional introduced in previous work. Further
using the Misner-Sharp mass and its previous perfect fluid definition, we
relate the spatial 2-expansion to the fluid pressure, density and acceleration.
The Raychaudhuri equations also allows us to define the MTS dynamic condition
with first order differentials so the MTS conditions are now shown to be all
first order differentials. This unified formalism allows one to realise that
the MTS can only exist in normal regions, and so it can exist only between
black hole horizons and cosmological horizons. Finally we obtain a relation
yielding the sign, on a TH, of the non-vanishing null expansion which
determines the nature of the TH from fluid content, and flow characteristics.
The 2+2 unified formalism here investigated thus proves a powerful tool to
reveal, in the future extensions, more of the very rich and subtle relations
between MTS and TH.

have a pronounced tendency to ferromagnetism both for bulk and surface atoms.
The presence of narrow-band surface states is shown to enhance the magnetic
moment as well as the exchange couplings. The most interesting results were
obtained for the Fe surface where the atoms have a tendency to couple
antiferromagnetically with each other. This interaction is relatively small,
when compared to interlayer ferromagnetic interaction, and strongly depends on
the lattice parameter. Local correlation effects are shown to lead to strong
changes of the overall shape of the spectral functions. However, they seem to
not play a decisive role on the overall picture of the magnetic couplings

processes important for solar physics. The relevant collision process rate
coefficients are generated by summing appropriately weighted Maxwellian rate
coefficients. This method reproduces the rate coefficients for a kappa
distribution to an estimated accuracy of better than 5%. This is equal to or
better than the accuracy of rate coefficients generated using ""reverse

the published Maxwellian rate coefficient data and then reconvolve the
extracted cross sections with the desired kappa distribution. Our approach of
summing Maxwellian rate coefficients is easy to implement using existing

Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution rate coefficients can be found for any value of
the parameter kappa, thereby enabling one to model plasmas with a time-varying
kappa. Tabulated Maxwellian fitting parameters are given for specific values of
kappa from 1.7 to 100. We also provide polynomial fits to these parameters over

we show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes
lead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure
between two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally
connected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal
structure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or
non-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating
space times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally
related to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements
performed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular
example of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it
needn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For
measurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce
the notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a
choice for measurements as the tensor product. For black holes, the tensor and
temporal products have the same measurement statistics, but result in different
type of non-monogamy of correlations, with the former being forbidden in
quantum theory while the latter is allowed. In the case of the AMPS firewall
experiment we find that the entanglement structure is modified, and one must
have entanglement between the infalling Hawking partners and early time
outgoing Hawking radiation which surprisingly tame violation of entanglement
monogamy.

background (CMB) anisotropies using observations made by the Planck satellite.
Our results are based mainly on the full Planck mission for temperature, but
also include some polarization measurements.
  In particular, we consider the CMB anisotropy maps derived from the
multi-frequency Planck data by several component-separation methods. For the
temperature anisotropies, we find excellent agreement between results based on
these sky maps over both a very large fraction of the sky and a broad range of
angular scales, establishing that potential foreground residuals do not affect
our studies.
  Tests of skewness, kurtosis, multi-normality, N-point functions, and
Minkowski functionals indicate consistency with Gaussianity, while a power
deficit at large angular scales is manifested in several ways, for example low
map variance. The results of a peak statistics analysis are consistent with the
expectations of a Gaussian random field. The ""Cold Spot"" is detected with
several methods, including map kurtosis, peak statistics, and mean temperature
profile. We thoroughly probe the large-scale dipolar power asymmetry, detecting
it with several independent tests, and address the subject of a posteriori
correction. Tests of directionality suggest the presence of angular clustering
from large to small scales, but at a significance that is dependent on the
details of the approach. We perform the first examination of polarization data,
finding the morphology of stacked peaks to be consistent with the expectations
of statistically isotropic simulations. Where they overlap, these results are
consistent with the Planck 2013 analysis based on the nominal mission data and
provide our most thorough view of the statistics of the CMB fluctuations to
date.

three-dimensional images. We consider a piecewise constant version of the
Mumford-Shah and the Chan-Vese functionals and perform a region-based
segmentation of 3D image data. An evolution law is derived from energy
minimization problems which push the surfaces to the boundaries of 3D objects
in the image. We propose a parametric scheme which describes the evolution of
parametric surfaces. An efficient finite element scheme is proposed for a
numerical approximation of the evolution equations. Since standard parametric
methods cannot handle topology changes automatically, an efficient method is
presented to detect, identify and perform changes in the topology of the
surfaces. One main focus of this paper are the algorithmic details to handle
topology changes like splitting and merging of surfaces and change of the genus
of a surface. Different artificial images are studied to demonstrate the
ability to detect the different types of topology changes. Finally, the
parametric method is applied to segmentation of medical 3D images.

using the 4.8 GHz - 36.8 GHz radio light curves obtained from three decades of
continuous monitoring. From a piecewise Gaussian fit to each flare, time lags
$\Delta t$ between the observation frequencies $\nu$ and spectral indices
$\alpha$ based on peak amplitudes $A$ are determined. From the fit $\Delta t
\propto \nu^{1/k_r}$, $k_r = 1.10 \pm 0.18$ indicating equipartition between
the magnetic field energy density and the particle energy density. From the fit
$A \propto \nu^\alpha$, $\alpha$ is in the range $-0.24$ to $1.52$. A mean
magnetic field strength at 1 pc, $B_1 = 0.5 \pm 0.2$ G, and at the core,
$B_{\rm core} = 46 \pm 16$ mG, are inferred, consistent with previous
estimates. The measure of core position offset is $\Omega_{r\nu} = 6.4 \pm 2.8$
pc GHz$^{1/k_r}$ when averaged over all frequency pairs. Based on the
statistical trend shown by the measured core radius $r_{\rm core}$ as a
function of $\nu$, we infer that the synchrotron opacity model may not be valid
for all cases. A Fourier periodogram analysis yields power law slopes in the
range $-1.6$ to $-3.5$ describing the power spectral density shape and gives
bend timescales in the range $0.52 - 0.66~$yr. This result, and both positive
and negative $\alpha$, indicate that the flares originate from multiple shocks
in a small region. Important objectives met in our study include: the
demonstration of the computational efficiency and statistical basis of the
piecewise Gaussian fit; consistency with previously reported results; evidence
for the core shift dependence on observation frequency and its utility in jet
diagnostics in the region close to the resolving limit of very long baseline
interferometry observations.

lattice Ising Spin Glasses (ISG) with a bimodal ($\pm J$) and Gaussian
interaction distributions. It is well established that the ordering temperature
of both models is zero. The Gaussian has a non-degenerate ground state so
exponent $\eta \equiv 0$ and it has a continuous distribution of energy levels.
For the bimodal model, above a size dependent cross-over temperature $T^{*}(L)$
there is a regime of effectively continuous energy levels; below $T^{*}(L)$
there is a distinct regime dominated by the highly degenerate ground state plus
an energy gap to the excited states. $T^{*}(L)$ tends to zero at very large $L$
leaving only the effectively continuous regime in the thermodynamic limit. We
show that in this regime the critical exponent $\eta$ is not zero, so the
effectively continuous regime $2$D bimodal ISG is not in the same universality
class as the $2$D Gaussian ISG. The simulation data on both models are analyzed
using a scaling variable $\tau = T^2/(1+T^2)$ suitable for zero temperature

simulation estimates can be obtained for the temperature dependence of the

neutrinos is assumed, the $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$-states of emitted electrons
as well as recoil corrections to the nucleon currents are taken into account.
Within the standard approximations the decay rate is factorized into a sum of
products of kinematical phase-space factors, nuclear matrix elements and the
fundamental parameters that characterize the lepton number violation. Unlike in
the previous treatments the induced pseudoscalar term of hadron current is
included, resulting in additional nuclear matrix elements. An improved
numerical computation of the phase-space factors is presented, based on the
exact Dirac wave functions of the $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ electrons with finite
nuclear size and electron screening taken into account. The dependence of
values of these phase-space factors on the different approximation schemes used
in evaluation of electron wave functions is discussed. The upper limits for
effective neutrino mass and the parameters $\langle\lambda\rangle$ and
$\langle\eta\rangle$ characterizing the right-handed current mechanism are
deduced from data on the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay of $^{76}$Ge and $^{136}$Xe
using nuclear matrix elements calculated within the nuclear shell model and
quasiparticle random phase approximation. The differential decay rates, i.e.
the angular correlations and the single electron energy distributions for
various combinations of the total lepton number violating parameters that can
help to disentangle the possible mechanism are described and discussed.

mass and energy consumption due to their inherently low densities.
Historically, widespread applicability has been limited by low strength
properties compared to other structural Al-, Ti- and Fe-based alloys. However,
recent studies have demonstrated high-specific-strength in a number of
nanocrystalline Mg-alloys. Even so, applications of these alloys would be
restricted to low-temperature automotive components due to microstructural
instability under high temperature creep loading. Hence, this work aims to gain
a better understanding of creep and associated deformation behavior of columnar
nanocrystalline Mg and Mg-yttrium (Y) (up to 3at.%Y(10wt.%Y)) with a grain size
of 5 nm and 10 nm. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, nanocrystalline
magnesium with and without local concentrations of yttrium is subjected to
constant-stress loading ranging from 0 to 500 MPa at different initial
temperatures ranging from 473 to 723 K. In pure Mg, the analyses of the
diffusion coefficient and energy barrier reveal that at lower temperatures
(i.e., T < ~423K) the contribution of grain boundary diffusion to the overall
creep deformation is stronger that the contribution of lattice diffusion.
However, at higher temperatures (T > ~423K) lattice diffusion dominates the
overall creep behavior. Interestingly, for the first time, we have shown that
the(101-1),(101-2),(101-3) and (101-6) boundary sliding energy is reduced with
the addition of yttrium. This softening effect in the presence of yttrium
suggests that the experimentally observed high temperature beneficial effects
of yttrium addition is likely to be attributed to some combination of other
reported creep strengthening mechanisms or phenomena such as formation of
stable yttrium oxides at grain boundaries or increased forest dislocation-based
hardening.

the Higgs sector of the spectacularly successful Standard Model led several
authors to explore whether low energy supersymmetry could play a role in
particle physics. Among these were Richard Arnowitt, Ali Chamseddine and Pran
Nath who constructed a viable {\em locally} supersymmetric Grand Unified Theory
(GUT), laying down the foundation for supergravity GUT models of particle
physics. Supergravity models continue to be explored as one of the most
promising extensions of the Standard Model. After a quick overview of some of
the issues and aspirations of early researchers working to bring supersymmetry
into the mainstream of particle physics, we re-examine early arguments that
seemed to imply that superpartners would be revealed in experiments at LEP2 or
at the Tevatron. Our purpose is to assess whether the absence of any
superpartners in searches at LHC8 presents a crisis for supersymmetry. Toward
this end, we re-evaluate fine-tuning arguments that lead to upper bounds on
(some) superpartner masses. We conclude that phenomenologically viable
superpartner spectra that could arise within a high scale model tuned no worse
than a few percent are perfectly possible. While no viable underlying model of
particle physics that leads to such spectra has yet emerged, we show that the
(supergravity-based) Radiatively-driven Natural Supersymmetry (RNS) framework
serves as a surrogate for a phenomenological analysis of an underlying theory
with modest fine-tuning. We outline the phenomenological implications of this
framework, with emphasis on those LHC and electron-positron collider signatures
that might point to the underlying natural origin of gauge and Higgs boson
masses. We conclude that the supergravity GUT paradigm laid down in 1982 by
Arnowitt, Chamseddine and Nath, and others, remains a vibrant possibility.

In turn, a lower bound of the critical clearing time (CCT) is obtained by
solving convex optimization problems without relying on any time-domain

simple and analytical equation of state, the pressure is equal to that of a
noninteracting Fermi gas in the entire BCS-BEC crossover, which is not
consistent with the features of a weakly interacting Bose condensate in the BEC
limit and a weakly interacting Fermi liquid in the BCS limit. The inadequacy of
the 2D mean-field theory indicates that the quantum fluctuations are much more
pronounced than those in 3D. In this work, we show that the inclusion of the
Gaussian quantum fluctuations naturally recovers the above features in both the
BEC and the BCS limits. In the BEC limit, the missing logarithmic dependence on
the boson chemical potential is recovered by the quantum fluctuations. Near the
quantum phase transition from the vacuum to the BEC phase, we compare our
equation of state with the known grand canonical equation of state of 2D Bose
gases and determine the ratio of the composite boson scattering length $a_{\rm

invariant under re-scalings, that is, it has a conformal gauge freedom.
Interestingly, as a consequence of the non-integrability of the connection, its
curvature is not invariant under conformal gauge transformations and,
therefore, neither is the associated pseudo-Riemannian geometry. We argue that
this is not surprising, since these two objects are associated with
irreversible processes. Moreover, we provide the explicit form in which all the
elements of the geometric structure of the Thermodynamic Phase Space change
under a conformal gauge transformation. As an example, we revisit the change of
the thermodynamic representation and consider the resulting change between the

the transport of energetic particles interacting with stochastic magnetic
fields. In particular the motion of particles across a large scale magnetic
field is difficult to describe analytically. However, progress has been
achieved in the recent years due to the development of the unified non-linear
transport theory which can be used to describe magnetic field line diffusion as
well as perpendicular diffusion of energetic particles. The latter theory
agrees very well with different independently performed test-particle
simulations. However, the theory is still based on different approximations and
assumptions. In the current article we extend the theory by taking into account
the finite gyroradius of the particle motion and calculate corrections in
different asymptotic limits. We consider different turbulence models as
examples such as the slab model, noisy slab turbulence, and the two-dimensional
model. Whereas there are no finite gyroradius corrections for slab turbulence,
the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is reduced in the other two cases. The
matter investigated in this article is also related to the parameter a^2
occurring in non-linear diffusion theories.

of NGC 1068 using MMT-Pol on the 6.5-m MMT. These observations allow us to
study the torus from a magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) framework. In a 0.5"" (30 pc)
aperture at K', we find that polarisation arising from the passage of radiation
from the inner edge of the torus through magnetically aligned dust grains in
the clumps is the dominant polarisation mechanism, with an intrinsic
polarisation of 7.0%$\pm$2.2%. This result yields a torus magnetic field
strength in the range of 4$-$82 mG through paramagnetic alignment, and
139$^{+11}_{-20}$ mG through the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The measured
position angle (P.A.) of polarisation at K$'$ is found to be similar to the
P.A. of the obscuring dusty component at few parsec scales using infrared
interferometric techniques. We show that the constant component of the magnetic
field is responsible for the alignment of the dust grains, and aligned with the
torus axis onto the plane of the sky. Adopting this magnetic field
configuration and the physical conditions of the clumps in the MHD outflow wind
model, we estimate a mass outflow rate $\le$0.17 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ at 0.4
pc from the central engine for those clumps showing near-infrared dichroism.
The models used were able to create the torus in a timescale of $\geq$10$^{5}$
yr with a rotational velocity of $\leq$1228 km s$^{-1}$ at 0.4 pc. We conclude
that the evolution, morphology and kinematics of the torus in NGC 1068 can be
explained within a MHD framework.

spectrum of the AGN out to >70keV. In gross terms, the NuSTAR spectrum of the
AGN has the form of a power law (Gamma~1.6-1.7) absorbed by a neutral column
density of N_H~1.6x10^23 cm^-2. However, we also detect curvature in the hard

accretion disk or obscuring torus, is required even permitting a high-energy
cutoff in the continuum source; the limit on the cutoff energy is E_cut>111keV

suggested by these data. We show that the ionized wind likely carries a
significant mass and momentum flux, and may carry sufficient kinetic energy to
exercise feedback on the host galaxy. If confirmed, the simultaneous presence
of a strong wind and powerful jets in Cygnus A demonstrates that feedback from
radio-jets and sub-relativistic winds are not mutually exclusive phases of AGN
activity but can occur simultaneously.

densities, $\bar{n}$. The evolution of a SNR in a self-consistently generated
three-phase ISM is qualitatively different from that in a uniform or a
two-phase warm/cold medium. By travelling faster and further in the low-density
hot phase, the domain of a SNR increases by $>10^{2.5}$. Varying $\bar{n}$ and
$S$, we find that a steady state can only be achieved when the hot gas volume
fraction $f_{\rm{V,hot}}\lesssim 0.6 \pm 0.1 $. Above that level, overlapping
SNRs render connecting topology of the hot gas, and the ISM is subjected to
thermal runaway. Photoelectric heating (PEH) has a surprisingly strong impact
on $f_{\rm{V,hot}}$. For $\bar{n}\gtrsim 3 \cm-3 $, a reasonable PEH rate is
able to suppress the thermal runaway. Overall, we determine the critical SN
rate for the onset of thermal runaway to be $S_{\rm{crit}} = 200

model spectra of single age-metallicity stellar populations at a resolution

The models have been tested by comparing them to observed colours of elliptical
galaxies and clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. Predicted absorption line

The comparisons show that our models are well suited for studying stellar
populations in unresolved galaxies. They are particularly useful for studying

understand its full extent and reliability for use with Stellar Population (SP)
modeling. The library consist of 210 stars, with a total of 292 spectra,
covering the wavelength range of 0.94 to 2.41 micron at a resolution R = 2000.
For every star we infer the effective temperature (Teff), gravity (logg) and
metallicity ([Z/Zsun]) using a full-spectrum fitting approach in a section of
the K band (2.19 to 2.34 micron) and temperature-NIR colour relations. We test
the flux calibration of these stars by calculating their integrated colours and
comparing them with the Pickles library colour-temperature relations. We also
investigate the NIR colours as a function of the calculated effective
temperature and compared them in colour-colour diagrams with the Pickles
library. This latter test shows a good broad-band flux calibration, important
for the SP models. Finally, we measure the resolution R as a function of
wavelength. We find that the resolution increases as a function of lambda from
about 6 angstrom in J to 10 angstrom in the red part of the K-band. With these
tests we establish that the IRTF library, the largest currently available
general library of stars at intermediate resolution in the NIR, is an excellent
candidate to be used in stellar population models. We present these models in
the next paper of this series.

To address this question we derive observational measures that are robust
(i.e., insensitive to detailed radiative transfer) and constrain the
contribution from $^{56}$Ni, as well as a combination of the envelope mass,
progenitor radius, and explosion energy. By applying our methods to a sample of
type II SNe from the literature we find that $^{56}$Ni contribution is often
significant. In our sample its contribution to the time weighted integrated
luminosity during the photospheric phase ranges between 8% and 72% with a
typical value of 30%. We find that the $^{56}$Ni relative contribution is
anti-correlated with the luminosity decline rate. When added to other clues,
this in turn suggests that the flat plateaus often observed in type II SNe are
not a generic feature of the cooling envelope emission, and that without
$^{56}$Ni many of the SNe that are classified as II-P would have shown a
decline rate that is steeper by up to 1 mag/100 d. Nevertheless, we find that
the cooling envelope emission, and not $^{56}$Ni contribution, is the main
driver behind the observed range of decline rates. Furthermore, contrary to
previous suggestions, our findings indicate that fast decline rates are not
driven by lower envelope masses. We therefore suggest that the difference in
observed decline rates is mainly a result of different density profiles of the
progenitors.

simulates both the planetesimal collisions and the dynamics of the resulting
dust grains, allowing us to model features and asymmetries in both thermal and
scattered light images of the disk. Our two-part model first simulates the
collisional and dynamical evolution of the planetesimals with the
Superparticle-Method Algorithm for Collisions in Kuiper belts (SMACK) and then
simulates the dynamical evolution of the resulting dust grains with a standard
Bulirsch-Stoer N-body integrator. Given the observed inclination and
eccentricity of the $\beta$ Pictoris b planet, the model neatly ties together
several features of the disk: the central hole in the submillimeter images, the
two-disk ""x""-pattern seen in scattered light, and possibly even the clumpy gas
seen by ALMA. We also find that most of the dust in the $\beta$ Pictoris system
is likely produced outside the ring at 60-100 AU. Instead of a birth ring, this
disk has a ""stirring ring"" at 60-100 AU where the high-velocity collisions
produced by the secular wave launched by the planet are concentrated. The
two-disk x-pattern arises because collisions occur more frequently at the peaks
and troughs of the secular wave. The perturbations of the disk in this region
create an azimuthally and vertically asymmetric spatial distribution of
collisions, which could yield an azimuthal clump of gas without invoking
resonances or an additional planet.

Wiener process and related random walks within the Gaussian framework of the
Central Limit Theorem will be introduced. Then, we will deliberately violate
fundamental assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem to elicit a larger
perspective, rooted in statistical physics, for analysing and modelling eye
movements in terms of anomalous, non-Gaussian, random walks and modern foraging
theory.
  Eventually, by resorting to machine learning techniques, we discuss how the
analyses of movement patterns can develop into the inference of hidden patterns

Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model simulating Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at temperature
$T$ and finite quark chemical potential $\mu$ without and with electrical
neutrality (EN) condition and at any $T$ and $\mu$ without EN condition. By
means of a quantitative investigation of the order parameter $m$, it is shown
that a nonzero $M_0$ is bound to lead to nonzero quark-antiquark condensates
throughout chiral phase transitions , no matter whether the order parameter $m$
varies discontinuously or continuously. In fact, a complete disappearance of
the quark-antiquark condensates are proven to demand the non-physical and
unrealistic conditions $\mu \,\geq$ or $\gg\, \sqrt{\Lambda^2+M_0^2}$ if $T=0$
and finite, or $T\to \infty$ if $\mu<\sqrt{\Lambda^2+M_0^2}$, where $\Lambda$
is the 3D momentum cut of the loop integrals. Theoretically these results show
that when $M_0$ is included, we never have a complete restoration of dynamical
(spontaneous) chiral symmetry breaking, including after a first order chiral
phase transition at low $T$ and high $\mu$. In physical reality, it is the
nonzero-ness of the quark-antiquark condensates that leads to the appearance of
a critical end point in the first order phase transition line and the crossover
behavior at high $T$ and/or high $\mu$ cases, rather than a possible
tricritical point and a second order phase transition line. They also provide a
basic reason for that one must consider the interplay between the chiral and
diquark condensates in the research on color superconductor at zero $T$ and
high $\mu$ case. The research shows that how a source term of the Lagrangian
(at present i.e. the current quark mass term) can greatly affect dynamical
behavior of a physical system.

$\mathbb{K}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ be a linear subspace of the space
$\mathcal{L}(U,V)$ of all linear maps from $U$ to $V$. A map $F : \mathcal{S}
\rightarrow V$ is called range-compatible when it satisfies $F(s) \in
\mathrm{im}(s)$ for all $s \in \mathcal{S}$. Among the range-compatible maps
are the so-called local ones, that is the maps of the form $s \mapsto s(x)$ for
a fixed vector $x$ of $U$.
  In recent works, we have classified the range-compatible group homomorphisms
on $\mathcal{S}$ when the codimension of $\mathcal{S}$ in $\mathcal{L}(U,V)$ is
small. In the present article, we study the special case when $\mathcal{S}$ is
a linear subspace of the space $S_n(\mathbb{K})$ of all $n$ by $n$ symmetric
matrices: we prove that if the codimension of $\mathcal{S}$ in
$S_n(\mathbb{K})$ is less than or equal to $n-2$, then every range-compatible
homomorphism on $\mathcal{S}$ is local provided that $\mathbb{K}$ does not have
characteristic $2$. With the same assumption on the codimension of
$\mathcal{S}$, we also classify the range-compatible homomorphisms on
$\mathcal{S}$ when $\mathbb{K}$ has characteristic $2$. Finally, we prove that
if $\mathcal{S}$ is a linear subspace of the space $A_n(\mathbb{K})$ of all $n$
by $n$ alternating matrices with entries in $\mathbb{K}$, and the codimension
of $\mathcal{S}$ is less than or equal to $n-3$, then every range-compatible
homomorphism on $\mathcal{S}$ is local.

LANS-alpha and NS-alpha deconvolution models of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence. The focus is on how well the model error may be characterized by a
stochastic force. Computations are also performed for a new turbulence model
obtained as a rescaled limit of the deconvolution model. The technique used is
to plug a solution obtained from direct numerical simulation of the
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations into the competing turbulence models
and to then compute the time evolution of the resulting residual. All
computations have been done in two dimensions rather than three for convenience
and efficiency. When the effective averaging length scale in any of the models
is $\alpha_0=0.01$ the time evolution of the root-mean-squared residual error
grows as $\sqrt t$. This growth rate is consistent with the hypothesis that the
model error may be characterized by a stochastic force. When $\alpha_0=0.20$
the residual error grows linearly. Linear growth suggests that the model error
possesses a systematic bias which dominates the stochastic terms. Finally, for
$\alpha_0=0.04$ the LANS-alpha model possessed systematic bias; however, for
this value of $\alpha_0$ the higher-order alpha models that were tested did
not.

distribution function $f(\mathbf x,\mathbf v)$ is represented by an ensemble of
three-dimensional manifolds, which we refer to as sheets. The electric
potential field is obtained by solving the Poisson equation on a uniform mesh,
where the charge density is evaluated by a spatial projection of the phase
space sheets. The SIC representation of phase space density facilitates robust,
high accuracy numerical evolution of the Vlasov-Poisson system using
significantly fewer tracer particles than comparable particle-in-cell (PIC)
approaches by reducing the numerical shot-noise associated with the latter. We
introduce the SIC formulation and describe its implementation in a new code,
which we validate using standard test problems including plasma oscillations,
Landau damping, and two stream instabilities in one dimension. Merits of the
new scheme are shown to include higher accuracy and faster convergence rates in
the number of particles. We finally motivate and outline the efficient

one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation is used to study the behavior
of collective compression waves. For appropriate conditions, the reduced
dynamics derived from perturbation and variational techniques allows to
describe a chain of dark or bright solitons as a chain of effective masses
connected by nonlinear springs taking the form of a Toda lattice model on the
soliton's positions. In turn, the Toda lattice possesses exact solitary
travelling compression wave solutions corresponding to travelling compression
waves in the original soliton chain. We coin the term hypersoliton to describe
such solitary waves riding on a chain of solitons. We corroborate our
analytical results with direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation. It is observed that in the case of dark soliton chains,
the formulated reduction dynamics provides an accurate description for the
robust evolution of travelling compression waves. In contrast, bright soliton
chains do not have such stable propagating solutions due to the
desynchronization of the mutual phases between consecutive solitons during
evolution. Finally, as an application to Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a
standard external harmonic trapping potential, we study the case of finite dark
soliton chain confined at the center of the trap. We find that when the central
chain is hit by a dark soliton initiated at the edge of the external trap, the
energy is transferred through the chain as a hypersoliton. When the
hypersoliton reaches the end of the central chain, a dark soliton is ejected
away from the center of the trap and, as it returns from its excursion up the
trap, hits the central chain producing again a hypersoliton. This periodic
evolution is the equivalent of the classical Newton's cradle.

close to the white dwarf surface, which is expected to reflect a significant
fraction of intrinsic X-rays above 10 keV, producing a Compton reflection hump.
However, up to now, a secure detection of this effect in magnetic CVs has
largely proved elusive because of the limited sensitivity of non-imaging X-ray
detectors. Here we report our analysis of joint NuSTAR/XMM-Newton observations
of three magnetic CVs, V709 Cas, NY Lup, and V1223 Sgr. The improved hard X-ray
sensitivity of the imaging NuSTAR data has resulted in the first robust
detection of Compton hump in all three objects, with amplitudes of ~1 or
greater in NY Lup, and likely <1.0 in the other two. We also confirm earlier
report of a strong spin modulation above 10 keV in V709 Cas, and report the
first detection of small spin amplitudes in the others. We interpret this as
due to different height of the X-ray emitting region among these objects. A
height of ~0.2 white dwarf radii provides a plausible explanation for the low
reflection amplitude of V709 Cas. Since emission regions above both poles are
visible at certain spin phases, this can also explain the strong hard X-ray
spin modulation. A shock height of ~0.05 white dwarf radii can explain our
results on V1223 Sgr, while the shock height in NY Lup appears negligible.

mixed-integer second-order cone relaxation for the gas expansion planning
problem under steady-state conditions. The underlying model offers tight lower

interesting properties of neutron stars. One can relate the first few multipole
moments of a neutron star, or quantities that can be derived from them, with
relations that are independent of the equation of state (EoS). This is a very
significant result that has great implications for the description of neutron
stars and in particular for the description of the spacetime around them.
Additionally, it was recently shown that there is a four parameter analytic
spacetime, known as the two-soliton spacetime, which can accurately capture the
properties of the geometry around neutron stars. This allows for the
possibility of describing in a unified formalism the astrophysically relevant
properties of the spacetime around a neutron star independently of the
particulars of the EoS for the matter of the star. More precisely, the
description of these astrophysical properties is done using an EoS omniscient
spacetime that can describe the exterior of any neutron star. In the present
work we investigate properties such as the location of the innermost stable
circular orbit $R_{ISCO}$ (or the surface of the star when the latter overcomes
the former), the various frequencies of perturbed circular equatorial
geodesics, the efficiency of an accretion disc, its temperature distribution,
and other properties associated with the emitted radiation from the disc, in a
way that holds for all possible choices of a realistic EoS for the neutron
star. Furthermore, we provide proof of principle that if one were to measure
the right combinations of pairs of these properties, with the additional
knowledge of the mass of the neutron star, one could determine the EoS of the
star.

This model is
an example of a spatial game in which players located on the~$d$-dimensional

their strategy at rate one by mimicking one of their neighbors chosen at random
with a probability proportional to the neighbor's payoff. To understand the
role of space in the form of local interactions, the process is compared with
its non-spatial deterministic counterpart for well-mixing populations, which is
described by the replicator equation. To begin with, we prove that, provided
the range of the interactions is sufficiently large, both strategies coexist on
the lattice for a parameter region where the replicator equation also exhibits
coexistence. Then, we identify parameter regions in which there is a dominant
strategy that always wins on the lattice whereas the replicator equation
displays either coexistence or bistability. Finally, we show that, for the
one-dimensional nearest neighbor system and in the parameter region
corresponding to the prisoner's dilemma game, cooperators can win on the
lattice whereas defectors always win in well-mixing populations, thus showing
that space favors cooperation. In particular, several parameter regions where

However, we also show that the number of elements within each cluster decreases
as the evaporation rate increases. We explain these results quantitatively by
comparison with the corresponding two-body problem and discuss their relevance
for controlling pattern formation in elastocapillary systems.

of the interplay of complex physical processes that occurs during the
gravitational collapse of prestellar cores. In this study, we investigate the
effect of the Hall current term on the formation of the circumstellar disk
using three- dimensional simulations. In our simulations, all non-ideal effects
as well as the radiation transfer are considered. The size of the disk is
significantly affected by a simple difference in the inherent properties of the
prestellar core, namely whether the rotation vector and the magnetic field are
parallel or anti- parallel. In the former case, only a very small disk (< 1 AU)
is formed. On the other hand, in the latter case, a massive and large (> 20 AU)
disk is formed in the early phase of protostar formation. Since the parallel
and anti-parallel properties do not readily change, we expect that the parallel
and anti-parallel properties are also important in the subsequent disk
evolution and the difference between the two cases is maintained or enhanced.
This result suggests that the disk size distribution of the Class 0 young
stellar objects is bimodal. Thus, the disk evolution can be categorized into
two cases and we may call the parallel and anti-parallel systems as Ortho-disk
and Para-disk, respectively. We also show that the anti-rotating envelopes
against the disk-rotation appear with a size of 200 AU. We predict that the
anti-rotating envelope will be found in the future observations.

merely resulted in redistribution of the wall power loads. Hence, it seems to
be possible to achieve ELM mitigation using in-vessel coils, while still
avoiding increased fast ion losses, by simply using a strong $B_{tot}$.

Structured machine learning methods were recently proposed for taking into

methods do not consistently perform better than their ""flat"" counterparts. We
postulate that this is partly due to the fact that standard methods already
reach a high level of accuracy in this context, and that they mainly confuse
species close to each other in the tree, a case where using the known hierarchy
is not helpful.

paper, a novel feature extraction method, named Centered Convolutional
Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CCRBM), is proposed for scene recognition. The
proposed model is an improved Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(CRBM) by introducing centered factors in its learning strategy to reduce the
source of instabilities. First, the visible units of the network are redefined
using centered factors. Then, the hidden units are learned with a modified
energy function by utilizing a distribution function, and the visible units are
reconstructed using the learned hidden units. In order to achieve better
generative ability, the Centered Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (CCDBN) is
trained in a greedy layer-wise way. Finally, a softmax regression is
incorporated for scene recognition. Extensive experimental evaluations using
natural scenes, MIT-indoor scenes, and Caltech 101 datasets show that the
proposed approach performs better than other counterparts in terms of
stability, generalization, and discrimination. The CCDBN model is more suitable
for natural scene image recognition by virtue of convolutional property.

information and coding theory. In this paper, some new results for the volume
of a metric ball in unitary group are derived via various tools from random
matrix theory. The first result is an integral representation of the exact
volume, which involves a Toeplitz determinant of Bessel functions. The
connection to matrix-variate hypergeometric functions and Szeg\H{o}'s strong
limit theorem lead independently from the finite size formula to an asymptotic
one. The convergence of the limiting formula is exceptionally fast due to an
underlying mock-Gaussian behavior. The proposed volume estimate enables simple
but accurate analytical evaluation of coding-theoretic bounds of unitary codes.
In particular, the Gilbert-Varshamov lower bound and the Hamming upper bound on
cardinality as well as the resulting bounds on code rate and minimum distance
are derived. Moreover, bounds on the scaling law of code rate are found.
Lastly, a closed-form bound on diversity sum relevant to unitary space-time
codes is obtained, which was only computed numerically in literature.

it allows to treat not only absorption and emission of quanta, but also
scattering processes, which however had very few applications in physical

application involving these two features, non-Markovianity and scattering

from Noether's theorem are modified by the collision term. Effects of the

similarly with the collisional effects. Particle, energy, and toroidal momentum
balance equations including collisional and turbulent transport fluxes are
systematically derived using a novel gyrokinetic collision operator, by which
the collisional change rates of energy and canonical toroidal angular momentum

accelerating oscillatory fronts in a new genre of nonlinear sonic vacua with

arise in dynamics of common and popular lattices. In this study, we address a
chain of particles oscillating in the plane and coupled by linear springs, with
fixed ends. When one end of this system is harmonically excited in the
transverse direction, one observes accelerated propagation of the excitation
front, accompanied by an almost monochromatic oscillatory tail. The front
propagation obeys the scaling law $l \sim t^{4/3}$. The frequency of the
oscillatory tail remains constant, and the wavelength scales as $\lambda \sim
t^{1/3}$. These scaling laws result from the nonlocal effects; we derive them
analytically (including the scaling coefficients) from a continuum
approximation. Moreover, a certain threshold excitation amplitude is required
in order to initiate the front propagation. The initiation threshold is
rationalized on the basis of a simplified discrete model. This model is further
reduced to a new completely integrable nonlinear system. The Letter introduces
a new and yet unexplored class of nonlinear sonic vacua and explores the
effects of strong non-locality on the initiation and propagation of oscillating
fronts in these media. Given their simplicity, nonlinear sonic vacua of the
type considered herein should be common in periodic lattices.

conventional arithmetic. Due to the symmetric nature of bosonic particles,
annihilation or creation of single particles translates a quantum state
depending on how many bosons are already in the given quantum system. This
proportionality results in a variety of non-classical features of quantum
mechanics including the bosonic commutation relation. The annihilation and
creation operations have recently been implemented in photonic systems.
However, this feature of quantum mechanics does not preclude the possibility of
realizing conventional arithmetic in quantum systems. We implement conventional
addition and subtraction of single phonons for a trapped \Yb ion in a harmonic
potential. In order to realize such operations, we apply the transitionless
adiabatic passage scheme on the anti-Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the
internal energy states and external motion states of the ion. By performing the
operations on superpositions of Fock states, we realize the hybrid computation
of classical arithmetic in quantum parallelism, and show that our operations
are useful to engineer quantum states. Our single-phonon operations are nearly
deterministic and robust against parameter changes, enabling handy repetition
of the operations independently from the initial state of the atomic motion. We
demonstrate the transform of a classical state to a nonclassical one of highly
sub-Poissonian phonon statistics and a Gaussian state to a non-Gaussian state,
by applying a sequence of the operations. The operations implemented here are
the Susskind-Glogower phase operators, whose non-commutativity is also
demonstrated.

In this paper, an efficient scene recognition approach is proposed based on

algorithm is employed to generate superpixels of input images, where each
superpixel is regarded as an input of a learning model. Then, a two-layer DBM
model is constructed by stacking two restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and
a greedy layer-wise algorithm is applied to train the DBM model. Finally, a
softmax regression is utilized to categorize scene images. The proposed
technique can effectively reduce the computational complexity and enhance the
performance for large natural image recognition. The approach is verified and
evaluated by extensive experiments, including the fifteen-scene categories
dataset the UIUC eight-sports dataset, and the SIFT flow dataset, are used to
evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed
approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition

computer vision techniques for recognizing pedestrian crosswalks and computing
their relative position from the user. Instead, this contribution addresses a
different problem; the design of an auditory interface that can effectively
guide the user during road crossing. Two original auditory guiding modes based
on data sonification are presented and compared with a guiding mode based on
speech messages.
  Experimental evaluation shows that there is no guiding mode that is best
suited for all test subjects. The average time to align and cross is not
significantly different among the three guiding modes, and test subjects
distribute their preferences for the best guiding mode almost uniformly among
the three solutions. From the experiments it also emerges that higher effort is
necessary for decoding the sonified instructions if compared to the speech
instructions, and that test subjects require frequent `hints' (in the form of
speech messages). Despite this, more than 2/3 of test subjects prefer one of
the two guiding modes based on sonification. There are two main reasons for
this: firstly, with speech messages it is harder to hear the sound of the
environment, and secondly sonified messages convey information about the
""quantity"" of the expected movement.

making the control of communication networks flexible. SDN separates the data
packet forwarding plane, i.e., the data plane, from the control plane and
employs a central controller. Network virtualization allows the flexible
sharing of physical networking resources by multiple users (tenants). Each
tenant runs its own applications over its virtual network, i.e., its slice of
the actual physical network. The virtualization of SDN networks promises to
allow networks to leverage the combined benefits of SDN networking and network
virtualization and has therefore attracted significant research attention in
recent years. A critical component for virtualizing SDN networks is an SDN
hypervisor that abstracts the underlying physical SDN network into multiple
logically isolated virtual SDN networks (vSDNs), each with its own controller.
We comprehensively survey hypervisors for SDN networks in this article. We
categorize the SDN hypervisors according to their architecture into centralized
and distributed hypervisors. We furthermore sub-classify the hypervisors
according to their execution platform into hypervisors running exclusively on
general-purpose compute platforms, or on a combination of general-purpose
compute platforms with general- or special-purpose network elements. We
exhaustively compare the network attribute abstraction and isolation features

location, size, elongation, brightness distribution, luminosity and
polarization provided the effective magnetization of the section of the pulsar

this implies that the striped zone is rather wide, with the magnetic

($N_v=3$), square-to-oblique ($N_v=4$) and triangle-to-oblique ($N_v=6$). The
model Hamiltonians contain a transition-specific Landau energy term, a domain
wall cost or Ginzburg term, and power-law anisotropic interaction potential,
induced from a strain compatibility condition. On quenching below a transition
temperature, we find behaviour similar to the previously studied
square-to-rectangle transition ($N_{OP} =1, N_v = 2$), showing that the rich
behaviour found, is generic. Thus we find for two-component order parameters,
that the same Hamiltonian can describe both athermal and isothermal martensite
regimes for different material parameters. The athermal/isothermal/austenite
parameter regimes and temperature-time-transformation diagrams are understood,
as previously, through parametrization of effective-droplet energies. In the
athermal regime, we find rapid conversions below a spinodal like temperature
and austenite-martensite conversion delays above it, as in the experiment. The
delays show early incubation behaviour, and at the transition to austenite the
delay times have Vogel-Fulcher divergences and are insensitive to Hamiltonian
energy scales, suggesting that entropy barriers are dominant.

influence of the independently identically distributed infection rates on the
average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state. The log-normal,
gamma and a newly designed distributions are considered for infection rates. We
find that, when the recovery rate is small, i.e.\ the epidemic spreads out in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases: 1) the heterogeneity of infection
rates on average retards the virus spreading, and 2) a larger even-order moment
of the infection rates leads to a smaller average fraction of infected nodes,
but the odd-order moments contribute in the opposite way; when the recovery
rate is large, i.e.\ the epidemic may die out or infect a small fraction of the
population, the heterogeneity of infection rates may enhance the probability
that the epidemic spreads out. Finally, we verify our conclusions via
real-world networks with their heterogeneous infection rates. Our results
suggest that, in reality the epidemic spread may not be so severe as the
classic SIS model indicates, but to eliminate the epidemic is probably more
difficult.

complementary combination of near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
spectroscopy (NEXAFS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy
electron diffraction (LEED). The oxide films have been prepared by molecular
beam epitaxy. Using NEXAFS, the identity of the Mn oxide has clearly been
determined as Mn$_3$O$_4$. For the initial stages of growth, oxide islands with
p(2$\times$1) and p(2$\times$2) structures are formed, which are embedded into
the substrate. For Mn$_3$O$_4$ coverages up to 1.5 unit cells a p(2$\times$1)
structure of the films is visible in STM and LEED. Further increase of the
thickness leads to a phase transition of the oxide films resulting in an
additional c(2$\times$2) structure with a 45$^\circ$ rotated atomic pattern.
The emerging film structures are discussed on the basis of a sublayer model of
the Mn$_3$O$_4$ spinel unit cell. While the polarity of the island edges
determines the structure of initial islands, the surface energy of thicker
layers is remarkably reduced by a film restructuring.

approximation to the set of quantum correlations which is contained in the
first level of the Navascu\'es, Pironio and Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy and also a
sufficient condition for the set of quantum correlations to be closed.
Furthermore, by our conic formulations, the value of a nonlocal game over the
sets of classical, quantum, no-signaling and unrestricted correlations can be
cast as a linear conic program. This allows us to show that a semidefinite
programming upper bound to the classical value of a nonlocal game introduced by
Feige and Lov\'asz is in fact an upper bound to the quantum value of the game
and moreover, it is at least as strong as optimizing over the first level of
the NPA hierarchy. Lastly, we show that deciding the existence of a perfect
quantum (resp. classical) strategy is equivalent to deciding the feasibility of
a linear conic program over the cone of completely positive semidefinite

topologically weakly mixing. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for

techniques for detecting and confirming extrasolar planetary candidates.
Unfortunately, stellar activity can induce RV variations which can drown out or
even mimic planetary signals - and it is notoriously difficult to model and
thus mitigate the effects of these activity-induced nuisance signals. This is
expected to be a major obstacle to using next-generation spectrographs to
detect lower mass planets, planets with longer periods, and planets around more
active stars. Enter Gaussian processes (GPs) which, we note, have a number of
attractive features that make them very well suited to disentangling stellar
activity signals from planetary signals. We present here a GP framework we
developed to model RV time series jointly with ancillary activity indicators
(e.g. bisector velocity spans, line widths, chromospheric activity indices),
allowing the activity component of RV time series to be constrained and
disentangled from e.g. planetary components. We discuss the mathematical
details of our GP framework, and present results illustrating its encouraging
performance on both synthetic and real RV datasets, including the
publicly-available Alpha Centauri B dataset.

brought about by each of three choices for the heliospheric magnetic field,
i.e. the unmodified Parker field, the Smith-Bieber modified field, and the

Parker field in the polar regions. In addition, it is argued that the
modification of Smith and Bieber is based on observational evidence and has a
firm physical basis, while these motivations are lacking in the case of the

the Smith-Bieber modification to be the most suitable choice for modifying the

shown how the Smith-Bieber modified field can be applied in cosmic ray

change in biology, in information and entropy descriptions of populations, and
in aspects of thermodynamics. The Price equation partitions the change in the
average value of a metric between two populations. A population may be composed
of organisms or particles or any members of a set to which we can assign
probabilities. A metric may be biological fitness or physical energy or the
output of an arbitrarily complicated function that assigns quantitative values
to members of the population. The first part of the Price equation describes
how directly applied forces change the probabilities assigned to members of the
population when holding constant the metrical values of the members---a fixed
metrical frame of reference. The second part describes how the metrical values
change, altering the metrical frame of reference. In canonical examples, the
direct forces balance the changing metrical frame of reference, leaving the
average or total metrical values unchanged. In biology, relative reproductive
success (fitness) remains invariant as a simple consequence of the conservation
of total probability. In physics, systems often conserve total energy.
Nonconservative metrics can be described by starting with conserved metrics,
and then studying how coordinate transformations between conserved and
nonconserved metrics alter the geometry of the dynamics and the aggregate
values of populations. From this abstract perspective, key results from
different subjects appear more simply as universal geometric principles for the
dynamics of populations subject to the constraints of particular conserved
quantities

quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at high energy, is applied to various scattering
processes. Higher order corrections to the CGC evolution equations, known as
the BK and JIMWLK equations, are also considered.
  It is shown that the leading order CGC calculations describe the experimental
data from electron-proton deep inelastic scattering (DIS), proton-proton and
proton-nucleus collisions. The initial condition for the BK evolution equation
is obtained by performing a fit to deep inelastic scattering data. The fit
result is used as an input to calculations of single particle spectra and
nuclear suppression in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, which are
shown to be in agreement with RHIC and LHC measurements. In particular, the
importance of a proper description of the nuclear geometry consistently with
the DIS data fits is emphasized, as it results in a nuclear suppression factor
$R_{pA}$ which is consistent with the available experimental data.
  In addition to single particle production, the correlations between two
hadrons at forward rapidity are computed. The RHIC measurements are shown to be
naturally explainable in the CGC framework, and the previous CGC calculations
are improved by including the so called inelastic and double parton scattering
contributions. This improvement is shown to be required in order to get results
compatible with the experimentally measured correlations.
  Exclusive vector meson production, which can be a powerful tool to study the
gluonic structure of nuclei at small Bjorken-$x$, is also considered. The cross
sections are calculated within the CGC framework in the context of a future
electron-ion collider. In particular, the cross section for incoherent
diffractive vector meson production is derived and a centrality estimator for
this process is proposed.

evolutionary change of a population into two components. The first component is
the partial change caused by the direct force of natural selection, holding
constant all aspects of the environment. The second component is the partial
change caused by the changing environment. I demonstrate that Fisher's
partition of total change into the direct force of selection and the forces
from the changing environmental frame of reference is identical to d'Alembert's
principle of mechanics, which separates the work done by the direct forces from
the work done by the inertial forces associated with the changing frame of
reference. In d'Alembert's principle, there exist inertial forces from a change
in the frame of reference that exactly balance the direct forces. I show that
the conservation of total probability strongly shapes the form of the balance
between the direct and inertial forces. I then use the strong results for
conserved probability to obtain general results for the change in any system
quantity, such as biological fitness or energy. Those general results derive
from simple coordinate changes between frequencies and system quantities.
Ultimately, d'Alembert's separation of direct and inertial forces provides deep
conceptual insight into the interpretation of forces and the unification of
disparate fields of study.

experimental studies in recent years. This interest is due to the fact that
these systems allow one to control their spin state by applying an external
photo-, thermo-, piezo-, or magnetic stimuli. The greatest amount of research
is currently devoted to the study the effect of the photoexcitation on the
bi-stable states of spin crossover single molecular magnets (SMMs). The main
limitation of photo-induced bi-stable states is their short lifetime. In this
paper we present the results of a study of the spin dynamics of the CoOEP
molecule in the Low Spin (LS) state and the High Spin (HS) state induced by
applying the magnetic pulse of 36.8 T. We show that the spin switching in case
of the HS state of the CoOEP molecule is characterized by a long lifetime and
is dependent on the magnitude and duration of the applied field. Thus, after
applying an external stimuli the system in the LS state after the spin
switching reverts to its ground state, whereas the system in the HS state
remains in the excited state for a long time. We found that the temperature
dependency of magnetic susceptibility shows an abrupt thermal spin transition
between two spin states at 40K. The proposed here theoretical approach opens
the way to create modern devices for spintronics with the controllable spin
switching process.

may operate as a nanoantenna for controlled and tunable directional emission.
Polar diagrams of the radiation intensity are presented showing that a constant
phase or amplitude difference at the positions of the emitters plays an
essential role in the directivity of the emission. We find that the radiation
patterns may differ dramatically for different phase and amplitude differences
at the positions of the emitters. As a result the system may operate as a two-
or one-sided nanoantenna. In particular, a two-sided highly focused directional
emission can be achieved when the emitters experience the same amplitude and a
constant phase difference of the driving field. We find a general directional
property of the emitted field that when the phase differences at the positions
of the emitters equal an even multiple of \pi/4, the system behaves as a
two-sided antenna. When the phase difference equals an odd multiple of \pi/4,
the system behaves as an one-sided antenna. The case when the emitters
experience the same phase but different amplitudes of the driving field is also

class is present in the $\log T_{90}$ distribution, or is it described by a
bimodal distribution. A standard $\chi^2$ fitting of a mixture of Gaussians is
applied to 25 histograms with different binnings. Different binnings give
various values of the fitting parameters, as well as the shape of the fitted
curve. Among five statistically significant fits none is trimodal. Locations of
the Gaussian components are in agreement with previous works. However, a
trimodal distribution, understood in the sense of having three separated peaks,
is not found for any binning. It is concluded that the duration distribution in
Fermi data is well described by a mixture of three log-normal distributions,
but it is intrinsically bimodal, hence no third class is present in the
$T_{90}$ data of Fermi. It is suggested that the log-normal fit may not be an
adequate model.

submodularity and convexity. Submodular functions have tight modular lower
bounds, and subdifferentials in a manner akin to convex functions. They also
admit poly-time algorithms for minimization and satisfy the Fenchel duality
theorem and the Discrete Seperation Theorem, both of which are fundamental
characteristics of convex functions. Submodular functions also show signs
similar to concavity. Submodular maximization, though NP hard, admits constant
factor approximation guarantees. Concave functions composed with modular
functions are submodular, and they also satisfy diminishing returns property.
This manuscript provides a more complete picture on the relationship between
submodularity with convexity and concavity, by extending many of the results
connecting submodularity with convexity to the concave aspects of
submodularity. We first show the existence of superdifferentials, and
efficiently computable tight modular upper bounds of a submodular function.
While we show that it is hard to characterize this polyhedron, we obtain inner
and outer bounds on the superdifferential along with certain specific and
useful supergradients. We then investigate forms of concave extensions of
submodular functions and show interesting relationships to submodular
maximization. We next show connections between optimality conditions over the
superdifferentials and submodular maximization, and show how forms of
approximate optimality conditions translate into approximation factors for
maximization. We end this paper by studying versions of the discrete seperation
theorem and the Fenchel duality theorem when seen from the concave point of
view. In every case, we relate our results to the existing results from the
convex point of view, thereby improving the analysis of the relationship
between submodularity, convexity, and concavity.

with memory that use reduced-size trellis descriptions for the received signal.
We assume an overall iterative receiver, and for the parts of the signal not
covered by the trellis description, we use interference cancelation based on
the soft information provided by the outer decoder. In order to reach a trellis
description, a linear filter is applied as front-end to compress the signal
structure into a small trellis. This process requires three parameters to be
designed: (i) the front-end filter, (ii) the feedback filter through which the
interference cancelation is done, and (iii) a target response which specifies
the trellis. Demodulators of this form have been studied before under then name
channel shortening (CS), but the interplay between CS and interference
cancelation has not been adequately addressed in the literature. In this paper,
we analyze two types of CS demodulators that are based on the Forney and
Ungerboeck detection models, respectively. The parameters are jointly optimized
based on a generalized mutual information (GMI) function. We also introduce a
third type of CS demodulator that is in general suboptimal but has closed form
solutions for all parameters. Moreover, signal to noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic
properties are analyzed and we show that the third CS demodulator
asymptotically converges to the optimal CS demodulator in the sense of
maximizing the GMI.

progression? Why do different tissues vary so much? There should, of course, be
no conflict between control and understanding. But the history of cancer
research seems to say that those different goals remain oddly estranged. Peto's
1977 article locates the seeds of this conflict most clearly. He describes what
is still the most powerful theoretical perspective for analyzing the causes of
cancer. He presents many key unsolved puzzles within that context. He also says
why most cancer researchers are not interested in these fundamental issues. The
subsequent decades of research grew around this rift, blindly, in the way that
research disciplines often grow. Let us revisit Peto, almost 40 years ago. We
can learn much about the current nature of cancer research.

associated switching rate may be described by a Neel-Brown-Arrhenius law, in
which the energy barrier is assumed as constant or a given temperature. Yet,
magnetic anisotropies in general depend on temperature themselves which is
known to modify the Neel-Brown-Arrhenius law. We illustrate quantitatively the
implications of a temperature-dependent anisotropy on the switching rate and in
particular for the interpretation of the prefactor as an attempt frequency. In
particular, we show that realistic numbers for the attempt frequency are

stellar irradiated discs. It is well known that thermal effects could reverse
the direction of planetary migration from inwards to outwards, potentially
saving planets in the inner, optically thick parts of the protoplanetary disc.
When considering stellar irradiation in addition to viscous friction as a
source of heating, the outer disc changes from a shadowed to a flared
structure. Using a suited analytical formula it has been shown that in the
flared part of the disc the migration is inwards; planets can migrate outwards
only in shadowed regions of the disc, { because the radial gradient of entropy
is stronger there}. In order to confirm this result numerically, we have
computed the total torque acting on planets held on fixed orbits embedded in
stellar irradiated 3D discs using the hydrodynamical code FARGOCA. We find
qualitatively good agreement between the total torque obtained with numerical
simulations and the one predicted by the analytical formula. For large masses
(>20 Earth masses) we find quantitative agreement, and we obtain outwards
migration regions for planets up to 60 Earth masses in the early stages of
accretional discs. We find nevertheless that the agreement with the analytic
formula is quite fortuitous because the formula underestimates the size of the
horseshoe region; this error is compensated by imperfect estimates of other
terms, most likely the cooling rate and saturation.

different altitudes of the observatory, three different telescope sizes and two
hadron interaction models (GHEISHA and FLUKA). More than 90% of the single
electromagnetic proton-induced subcascade events are showers with primary
energy below 200 GeV, regardless on the trigger threshold. The estimated
efficiency of the gamma/hadron separation using the FLUKA model is similar to
results obtained using the GHEISHA model. Nevertheless, for at least one
triggered telescope only, a higher fraction of single electromagnetic
subcascade events was obtained from the FLUKA model. Finally, the calculated
quality factors are anti-correlated with the contributions of the false
gamma-ray events in the proton initiated showers. Therefore, the occurrence of
single electromagnetic subcascade events is one of the main reasons of the
worsening of the primary gamma-ray selection efficiency at low energies.

molecular dynamics simulations, we have assessed the applicability of a new
class of carbon nanomaterials for the nanoresonator usage, i.e., the single
wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) network. It is found that the SWNT networks inherit
the excellent mechanical properties from the constituent SWNTs, possessing a
high natural frequency. However, although a high quality factor is suggested
from the simulation results, it is hard to obtain an unambiguous Q-factor due
to the existence of vibration modes in addition to the dominant mode. The
nonlinearities resulting from these extra vibration modes are found to exist
uniformly under various testing conditions including different initial
actuations and temperatures. Further testing shows that these modes can be
effectively suppressed through the introduction of axial strain, leading to an
extremely high quality factor in the order of 109 estimated from the SWNT
network with 2% tensile strain. Additional studies indicate that the carbon
rings connecting the SWNTs can also be used to alter the vibrational properties
of the resulting network. This study suggests that the SWNT network can be a
good candidate for the applications as nanoresonators.

drastically reduced, and the point-source sensitivity improved, by selecting a
narrow time window around possible neutrino production periods. Blazars, being
radio-loud active galactic nuclei with their jets pointing almost directly
towards the observer, are particularly attractive potential neutrino point
sources, since they are among the most likely sources of the very high-energy
cosmic rays. Neutrinos and gamma rays may be produced in hadronic interactions
with the surrounding medium. Moreover, blazars generally show high time
variability in their light curves at different wavelengths and on various time
scales. This paper presents a time-dependent analysis applied to a selection of
flaring gamma-ray blazars observed by the FERMI/LAT experiment and by TeV
Cherenkov telescopes using five years of ANTARES data taken from 2008 to 2012.
The results are compatible with fluctuations of the background. Upper limits on

downlink and uplink multicarrier transmission assisted by a shared user
equipment (UE)-side distributed antenna system (SUDAS). The proposed SUDAS
simultaneously utilizes licensed frequency bands and unlicensed frequency
bands, (e.g. millimeter wave bands), to enable a spatial multiplexing gain for
single-antenna UEs to improve energy efficiency and system throughput of $5$-th
generation (5G) outdoor-to-indoor communication. The design of the UE
selection, the time allocation to uplink and downlink, and the transceiver
processing matrix is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for the
maximization of the end-to-end system energy efficiency (bits/Joule). The
proposed problem formulation takes into account minimum data rate requirements
for delay sensitive UEs and the circuit power consumption of all transceivers.
In order to design a tractable resource allocation algorithm, we first show
that the optimal transmitter precoding and receiver post-processing matrices
jointly diagonalize the end-to-end communication channel for both downlink and
uplink communication via SUDAS. Subsequently, the matrix optimization problem
is converted to an equivalent scalar optimization problem for multiple parallel
channels, which is solved by an asymptotically globally optimal iterative
algorithm. Besides, we propose a suboptimal algorithm which finds a locally
optimal solution of the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results
illustrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithms for SUDAS achieve a
significant performance gain in terms of system energy efficiency and spectral
efficiency compared to conventional baseline systems by offering multiple
parallel data streams for single-antenna UEs.

angular momentum-based, quadratic intrinsic alignment model we derive
correlation functions of the ellipticity components and project them to yield
the four non-zero angular ellipticity spectra $C^\epsilon_E(\ell)$,
$C^\epsilon_B(\ell)$, $C^\epsilon_C(\ell)$ and $C^\epsilon_S(\ell)$ in their
generalisation to tomographic surveys. For a Euclid-like survey, these spectra
would have amplitudes smaller than the weak lensing effect on nonlinear
structures, but would constitute an important systematic. Computing estimation
biases for cosmological parameters derived from an alignment-contaminated
survey suggests biases of $+5\sigma_w$ for the dark energy equation of state
parameter $w$, $-20\sigma_{\Omega_m}$ for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and
$-12\sigma_{\sigma_8}$ for the spectrum normalisation $\sigma_8$. Intrinsic
alignments yield a signal which is easily observable with a survey similar to
Euclid: While not independent, significances for estimates of each of the four
spectra reach values of tens of $\sigma$ if weak lensing and shape noise are
considered as noise sources, which suggests relative uncertainties on alignment
parameters at the percent level.

  Games with Payoffs that are Probability-Distributions",,,,,"econ.GN math.ST q-fin.EC stat.AP stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal behavior in (competitive) situation is traditionally determined with
the help of utility functions that measure the payoff of different actions.
Given an ordering on the space of revenues (payoffs), the classical axiomatic
approach of von Neumann and Morgenstern establishes the existence of suitable
utility functions, and yields to game-theory as the most prominent
materialization of a theory to determine optimal behavior. Although this
appears to be a most natural approach to risk management too, applications in
critical infrastructures often violate the implicit assumption of actions
leading to deterministic consequences. In that sense, the gameplay in a
critical infrastructure risk control competition is intrinsically random in the
sense of actions having uncertain consequences. Mathematically, this takes us
to utility functions that are probability-distribution-valued, in which case we
loose the canonic (in fact every possible) ordering on the space of payoffs,
and the original techniques of von Neumann and Morgenstern no longer apply.
  This work introduces a new kind of game in which uncertainty applies to the
payoff functions rather than the player's actions (a setting that has been
widely studied in the literature, yielding to celebrated notions like the
trembling hands equilibrium or the purification theorem). In detail, we show
how to fix the non-existence of a (canonic) ordering on the space of
probability distributions by only mildly restricting the full set to a subset
that can be totally ordered. Our vehicle to define the ordering and establish
basic game-theory is non-standard analysis and hyperreal numbers.

iterative procedure for constructing Bell inequalities tailored for networks:
starting from a given network, and a corresponding Bell inequality, our
technique provides new Bell inequalities for a more complex network, involving
one additional source and one additional observer. The relevance of our method
is illustrated on a variety of networks, for which we demonstrate significant
quantum violations.

modulus of $(m-M)_0=11.17\pm0.08$, and a reddening of $E(B-V)=0.036\pm0.010$.
The radial surface density profile of NGC 188 is obtained by star count. By
fitting the King model, the structural parameters of NGC 188 are derived: a
core radius of $R_{c}=3.80'$, a tidal radius of $R_{t}=44.78'$, and a
concentration parameter of $C_{0}=\log(R_{t}/R_{c})=1.07$. Fitting the mass
function to a power-law function $\phi(m) \propto m^{\alpha}$, the slopes of

presents a slope break in the mass function. The break mass is $m_{\rm

the overall region is $\alpha=-0.76$. The slope of the core region is
$\alpha=1.09$, and the slopes of the external regions are $\alpha=-0.86$ and
$\alpha=-2.15$, respectively. In the mass range below $m_{\rm break}$, these
slopes are $\alpha=0.12$, $\alpha=4.91$, $\alpha=1.33$, and $\alpha=-1.09$,
respectively. The mass segregation in NGC 188 is reflected in the obvious
variation of the slopes in different spatial regions of this cluster.

inference can be decoupled for the separate components of the model. This
procedure can scale to very large datasets and allows for the use of standard,
existing, software from Bayesian nonparametric density estimation and
Plackett-Luce ranking estimation to be applied. As an illustration, we show an

between longitudinal markers and a time-to-event, and have been extended to
multiple markers and/or competing risks. The competing risk of death must be
considered in the elderly because death and dementia have common risk factors.
Moreover, in cohort studies, time-to-dementia is interval-censored because
dementia is only assessed intermittently. So subjects can become demented and
die between two follow-up visits without being diagnosed. To study pre-dementia
cognitive decline, we propose a joint latent class model combining a (possibly
multivariate) mixed model and an illness-death model handling both interval
censoring (by accounting for a possible unobserved transition to dementia) and
semi-competing risks. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood handling
interval censoring. The correlation between the marker and the times-to-events
is captured by latent classes, homogeneous groups with specific risks of death
and dementia and profiles of cognitive decline. We propose markovian and
semi-markovian versions. Both approaches are compared to a joint latent class
model for standard competing risks through a simulation study, and then applied
in a prospective cohort study of cerebral and functional ageing to distinguish
different profiles of cognitive decline associated with risks of dementia and
death. The comparison highlights that among demented subjects, mortality
depends more on age than duration of dementia. This model distinguishes the
so-called terminal pre-death decline (among non-demented subjects) from the
pre-dementia decline.

policy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then
identify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches
most frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative,
optimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the
full-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual
influences among agents and capture related self-reinforcing (positive
feedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and
path-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent
heterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling
approach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its
use in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption
and diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3)
interactions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and
(4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the
proposed methodology is discussed by reference to four applications: the
diffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on
income and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the
cross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. The article calls for a fundamental
methodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with
that of the climatic system, for a combined and realistic understanding of the
impact of sustainability policies.

shown to localize near the X-point, but does so asymmetrically in the poloidal

greater than the collisional resistivity used in the simulations.

usually analysed through solving the Chemical Master Equation (CME) or
performing extensive simulations. Analysing stochasticity is often needed,
particularly when some molecules occur in low numbers. Unfortunately, both
approaches become infeasible if the system is complex and/or it cannot be
ensured that initial populations are small. We develop a probabilistic logic
for CRNs that enables stochastic analysis of the evolution of populations of
molecular species. We present an approximate model checking algorithm based on
the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) of the CME, whose computational complexity
is independent of the population size of each species and polynomial in the
number of different species. The algorithm requires the solution of first order
polynomial differential equations. We prove that our approach is valid for any
CRN close enough to the thermodynamical limit. However, we show on four case
studies that it can still provide good approximation even for low molecule
counts. Our approach enables rigorous analysis of CRNs that are not analyzable
by solving the CME, but are far from the deterministic limit. Moreover, it can
be used for a fast approximate stochastic characterization of a CRN.

after Saturn encounter by Pioneer 11 is not necessarily due to mismodeling of
solar radiation pressure but instead reflects a physically relevant
characteristic of the anomaly itself. We employ the principles of a recently
proposed cosmological model termed ""the theory of inertial centers"" along with
an understanding of the fundamental assumptions taken by the Deep Space Network
(DSN) to attempt to model this sudden onset. Due to an ambiguity that arises
from the difference in the DSN definition of expected light-time with
light-time according to the theory of inertial centers, we are forced to adopt
a seemingly arbitrary convention to relate DSN-assumed clock-rates to physical
clock-rates for this model. We offer a possible reason for adopting the
convention employed in our analysis; however, we remain skeptical.
Nevertheless, with this convention, one finds that this theory is able to
replicate the previously reported Hubble-like behavior of the ""clock
acceleration"" for the Pioneer anomaly as well as the sudden onset of the
anomalous acceleration after Pioneer 11 Saturn encounter. While oscillatory
behavior with a yearly period is also predicted for the anomalous clock
accelerations of both Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, the predicted amplitude is an
order of magnitude too small when compared with that reported for Pioneer 10.

  ${\rm SOL}(P_{2,\lambda})$ of the minimization problems.} \\ {}& \text{2.

provides contributions to both tasks: Regarding the first task for a more
special setting we prove that there are intervals $(0,c)$ and $(0,d)$ such that
the setvalued curves \begin{align*}

Moreover we show that the solver sets are changing all the time while $\tau$
runs from $0$ to $c$ and $\lambda$ runs from $d$ to $0$.
  In the presence of lower semicontinuity the second task is done if we have
additionally coercivity. We regard lower semicontinuity and coercivity from a
topological point of view and develop a new technique for proving lower
semicontinuity plus coercivity.
  Dropping any lower semicontinuity assumption we also prove a theorem on the
coercivity of a sum of functions.

of all kinds of knots in links in hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, non Abelian
gauge field theories and gravity. Although knots and links are observables of
the Chern-Simons (C-S) functional, the dynamical conditions for their
generation lie outside of the scope of the C-S theory. The nontriviality of
dynamical generation of knotted structures is caused by the fact that the
complements of all knots/links, say, in S^3 are 3-manifolds which have
positive, negative or zero curvature. The ability to curve the ambient space
thus far is attributed to masses. The mass theorem of general relativity
requires the ambient 3-manifolds to be of non negative curvature. Recently, we
established that, in the absence of boundaries, complements of dynamically
generated knots/links are represented by 3-manifolds of non negative curvature.
This fact opens the possibility to discuss masses in terms of dynamically
generated knotted/ linked structures. The key tool is the notion of knot/link
concordance. The concept of concordance is an adaptation of the concept of
cobordism to knots and links. The logic of implementation of the concordance
concept to physical masses results in new interpretation of Casson's surgery
formula in terms of the Regge trajectories. The latest thoroughly examined
Chew-Frautschi (C-F) plots associated with these trajectories demonstrate that
the hadron mass spectrum for both mesons and baryons is nicely described by the
data on the corresponding C-F plots. The physics behind Casson's surgery
formula is similar but not identical to that described purely
phenomenologically by Keith Moffatt in 1990. The developed topological
treatment is fully consistent with available rigorous mathematical and
experimentally observed results related to physics of hadrons
