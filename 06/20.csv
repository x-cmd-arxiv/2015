exact in an asymptotic sense, are provided for the spectral efficiencies
(b/s/Hz) of links in these systems. It is also found that when the number of
base-station antennas is moderately large, and the number of mobiles in the
entire network is large, correlations between the transmit powers of mobiles
within a given cell do not significantly influence the spectral efficiency of
the system. As a result, mobiles can perform simple power control (e.g.
fractional power control) that does not depend on other users in the network,
reducing system complexity and improving the analytical tractability of such
systems.

points in a sparse yet effective structure, called the in-tree (IT) graph,
which is able to capture a wide class of underlying cluster structures in the
datasets, especially for the density-based datasets. Although there are some
redundant edges or lines between clusters requiring to be removed by computer,
this IT graph has a big advantage compared with the k-nearest-neighborhood
(k-NN) or the minimal spanning tree (MST) graph, in that the redundant edges in
the IT graph are much more distinguishable and thus can be easily determined by
several methods previously proposed by us.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework to re-construct the IT graph,
based on an initial neighborhood graph, such as the k-NN or MST, etc, and the
corresponding graph distances. For this general framework, our previous way of
constructing the IT graph turns out to be a special case of it. This general
framework 1) can make the IT graph capture a wider class of underlying cluster
structures in the datasets, especially for the manifolds, and 2) should be more
effective to cluster the sparse or graph-based datasets.

at quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion, to understand:
(i) whether positive conversations spread faster and/or broader than negative

conversations on social media; and, (iii) what type of sentiment is expressed
in conversations characterized by different temporal dynamics. Our findings
show that, at the level of contents, negative messages spread faster than
positive ones, but positive ones reach larger audiences, suggesting that people
are more inclined to share and favorite positive contents, the so-called
positive bias. As for the entire conversations, we highlight how different
temporal dynamics exhibit different sentiment patterns: for example, positive
sentiment builds up for highly-anticipated events, while unexpected events are
mainly characterized by negative sentiment. Our contribution is a milestone to
understand how the emotions expressed in short texts affect their spreading in

the response function around 10 A. One of them has a secondary smaller peak
around 170 A, which leads to a contamination of SXR images. The observed
darkening in both of these filters has a very large vertical extension. The
position and shape of the darkening corresponds nicely with the prominence
structure seen in SDO/AIA images. First we have investigated the possibility
that the darkening is caused by X-ray absorption. But detailed calculations of
the optical thickness in this spectral range show clearly that this effect is
completely negligible. Therefore the alternative is the presence of an extended
region with a large emissivity deficit which can be caused by the presence of
cool prominence plasmas within otherwise hot corona. To reproduce the observed
darkening one needs a very large extension along the line-of-sight of the
region amounting to around 10$^5$ km. We interpret this region as the
prominence spine, which is also consistent with SDO/AIA observations in EUV.

of air. In such environment, the exposure to particulate matter and other air
pollutants is enhanced, with a consequent worsening of both safety and health.
The main solution adopted by the international community is aimed at the
reduction of the emissions. In this theoretical study, we test a new solution:
the removal of air pollutants close to their sources by a network of Air
Pollution Abatement (APA) devices. The APA technology depletes gaseous and
particulate air pollutants by a portable and low-consuming scrubbing system,
that mimics the processes of wet and dry deposition. We estimate the potential
pollutant abatement efficacy of a single absorber by Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) method. The presence of the scrubber effectively creates an
additional sink at the bottom of the canyon, accelerating its cleaning process
by up to 70%, when an almost perfect scrubber (90% efficiency) is simulated.
The efficacy of absorber is not proportional to its internal abatement
efficiency, but it increases rapidly at low efficiencies, then tends to
saturate. In the particular configuration of the canyon we choose (aspect ratio
of 3) the upwind corner is the most favourable for the absorber application. In
the downwind corner the maximum pollutant abatement is -24%, while in the
upwind corner the maximum abatement is twice as much at -51%. The efficacy of
the absorber increases much faster at low efficiencies: at 25% efficiency, the
abatement is already about half that obtained with the 90% efficiency. These
first results, suggest strategies for the real-world application of a network
of absorbers, and motivates further theoretical study to better characterize
the details of the air flow inside and around the absorber.

as far as possible. Fundamental determinations of Teff and logg were obtained
in a systematic way from a compilation of angular diameter measurements and
bolometric fluxes, and from a homogeneous mass determination based on stellar
evolution models. The derived parameters were compared to recent spectroscopic
and photometric determinations and to gravity estimates based on seismic data.
Most of the adopted diameter measurements have formal uncertainties around 1%,
which translate into uncertainties in effective temperature of 0.5%. The
measurements of bolometric flux seem to be accurate to 5% or better, which
contributes about 1% or less to the uncertainties in effective temperature. The
comparisons of parameter determinations with the literature show in general
good agreements with a few exceptions, most notably for the coolest stars and
for metal-poor stars. The sample consists of 29 FGK-type stars and 5 M giants.
Among the FGK stars, 21 have reliable parameters suitable for testing,
validation, or calibration purposes. For four stars, future adjustments of the
fundamental Teff are required, and for five stars the logg determination needs
to be improved. Future extensions of the sample of Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars are
required to fill gaps in parameter space, and we include a list of suggested

that are characterized by moving 3D positions and color attributes. As
temporally successive point cloud frames are similar, motion estimation is key
to effective compression of these sequences. It however remains a challenging
problem as the point cloud frames have varying numbers of points without
explicit correspondence information. We represent the time-varying geometry of
these sequences with a set of graphs, and consider 3D positions and color
attributes of the points clouds as signals on the vertices of the graphs. We
then cast motion estimation as a feature matching problem between successive
graphs. The motion is estimated on a sparse set of representative vertices
using new spectral graph wavelet descriptors. A dense motion field is
eventually interpolated by solving a graph-based regularization problem. The
estimated motion is finally used for removing the temporal redundancy in the
predictive coding of the 3D positions and the color characteristics of the
point cloud sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able
to accurately estimate the motion between consecutive frames. Moreover, motion
estimation is shown to bring significant improvement in terms of the overall
compression performance of the sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper that exploits both the spatial correlation inside each frame
(through the graph) and the temporal correlation between the frames (through
the motion estimation) to compress the color and the geometry of 3D point cloud
sequences in an efficient way.

estimates, the resulting ""coarsened"" posterior can be approximated by simply
tempering the likelihood---that is, by raising it to a fractional power---thus,

entanglement among particles located in different cavities, which are important
for large-scale quantum information processing. We here consider a multi-cavity
system where cavities are coupled to a superconducting (SC) qubit and each
cavity hosts many SC qubits. We show that all intra-cavity SC qubits plus the
coupler SC qubit can be prepared in an entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) state, by using a single operation and without the need of measurements.
The GHZ state is created without exciting the cavity modes; thus greatly
suppressing the decoherence caused by the cavity-photon decay and the effect of
unwanted inter-cavity crosstalk on the operation. We also introduce two simple
methods for entangling the intra-cavity SC qubits in a GHZ state. As an
example, our numerical simulations show that it is feasible, with current
circuit-QED technology, to prepare high-fidelity GHZ states, for up to nine SC
qubits by using SC qubits distributed in two cavities. This proposal can in
principle be used to implement a GHZ state for {\it an arbitrary number} of SC
qubits distributed in multiple cavities. The proposal is quite general and can
be applied to a wide range of physical systems, with the intra-cavity qubits
being either atoms, NV centers, quantum dots, or various SC qubits.

direct numerical simulation. In this paper we consider a rich family of
continuum PDE models for which we rigorously study regimes where topologically
protected edge states exist. Our model is a class of Schroedinger operators on
$\mathbb{R}^2$ with a background 2D honeycomb potential perturbed by an
""edge-potential"". The edge potential is a domain-wall interpolation, transverse
to a prescribed ""rational"" edge, between two distinct periodic structures.
General conditions are given for the bifurcation of a branch of topologically
protected edge states from Dirac points of the background honeycomb structure.
The bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of a 1D effective Dirac operator. A
key condition is a spectral no-fold condition for the prescribed edge. We then
use this result to prove the existence of topologically protected edge states
along zigzag edges of certain honeycomb structures. Our results are consistent
with the physics literature and appear to be the first rigorous results on the
existence of topologically protected edge states for continuum 2D PDE systems
describing waves in a non-trivial periodic medium. We also show that the family
of Hamiltonians we study contains cases where zigzag edge states exist, but
which are not topologically protected.

novel, theoretically sound classifier --- the Extreme Value Machine (EVM). The

stretch at fluid interfaces. This deformation can increase adsorption energies
by orders of magnitude relative to rigid particles. The deformation of a
particle at an interface is governed by a competition of bulk elasticity and
surface tension. When particles are partially wet by the two liquids,
deformation is localized within a material-dependent distance $L$ from the
contact line. At the contact line, the particle morphology is given by a
balance of surface tensions. When the particle radius $R \ll L$, the particle
adopts a lenticular shape identical to that of an adsorbed fluid droplet.
Particle deformations can be elastic or plastic, depending on the relative
values of the Young modulus, $E$, and yield stress, $\sigma_p$. When surface
tensions favour complete spreading of the particles at the interface, plastic
deformation can lead to unusual fried-egg morphologies. When deformable
particles have surface properties that are very similar to one liquid phase,
adsorption can be extremely sensitive to small changes of their affinity for
the other liquid phase. These findings have implications for the adsorption of
microgel particles at fluid interfaces and the performance of
stimuli-responsive Pickering emulsions.

weak lensing signals at small radii $R<\sim 10~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. However, their
halo bias inferred from both the large-scale weak lensing and the projected
auto-correlation functions differs by a factor of $\sim$1.5, which is a
signature of assembly bias. The same bias hypothesis for the two subsamples is
excluded at 2.5$\sigma$ in the weak lensing and 4.4$\sigma$ in the
auto-correlation data, respectively. This result could bring a significant
impact on both galaxy evolution and precision cosmology.

no real pseudogap is generated. At low temperature spontaneous charge order
with a $d$-form factor can be stabilized for certain parameters. As long as the

efficiently as possible is a key requirement in many astrophysical simulations.
It is therefore important to continuously advance the numerical methods
implemented in current astrophysical codes, especially also in light of
evolving computer technology, which favours certain computational approaches
over others. Here we introduce the new adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code
TENET, which employs a high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for
hydrodynamics. The Euler equations in this method are solved in a weak
formulation with a polynomial basis by means of explicit Runge-Kutta time
integration and Gauss-Legendre quadrature. This approach offers significant
advantages over commonly employed second order finite volume (FV) solvers. In
particular, the higher order capability renders it computationally more
efficient, in the sense that the same precision can be obtained at
significantly less computational cost. Also, the DG scheme inherently conserves
angular momentum in regions where no limiting takes place, and it typically
produces much smaller numerical diffusion and advection errors than a FV
approach. A further advantage lies in a more natural handling of AMR refinement
boundaries, where a fall-back to first order can be avoided. Finally, DG
requires no wide stencils at high order, and offers an improved data locality
and a focus on local computations, which is favourable for current and upcoming
highly parallel supercomputers. We describe the formulation and implementation
details of our new code, and demonstrate its performance and accuracy with a
set of two- and three-dimensional test problems. The results confirm that DG
schemes have a high potential for astrophysical applications.

SUSY or composite Higgs theories, the partners carry SM color and are becoming
increasingly constrained by LHC searches. However, theories like Folded SUSY
(FS), Twin Higgs (TH) and Quirky Little Higgs (QLH) introduce uncolored top
partners, which can be SM singlets or carry electroweak charge. Their small
production cross section left doubt as to whether the LHC can effectively probe
such scenarios. Typically, these partners are charged under their own mirror
color gauge group. In FS and QLH, the absence of light mirror matter allows
glueballs to form at the bottom of the mirror spectrum. This is also the case
in some TH realizations. The Higgs can decay to these mirror glueballs, with
the glueballs decaying into SM particles with potentially observable lifetimes.
We undertake the first detailed study of this glueball signature and
quantitatively demonstrate the discovery potential of uncolored naturalness via
exotic Higgs decays at the LHC and a potential future 100 TeV collider. Our
findings indicate that mirror glueballs are the smoking gun signature of
natural FS and QLH type theories, in analogy to tree-level Higgs coupling
shifts for the TH. We show that glueball masses in the $\sim$ 10-60 GeV mass
range are theoretically preferred. Careful treatment of lifetime,
mirror-hadronization and nonperturbative uncertainties is required to perform
meaningful collider studies. We outline several new search strategies for
exotic Higgs decays of the form $h\to XX \to 4f$ at the LHC, with $X$ having
lifetimes in the $10 \mu m$ to $km$ range. We find that FS stops can be probed
with masses up to 600 (1100) GeV at the LHC with 300 (3000) /fb of data, and TH
top partners could be accessible with masses up to 900 (1500) GeV. This makes
exotic Higgs decays the prime discovery channel for uncolored naturalness at
the LHC.

observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton from 40 to 80 days after the flare
reveal a bright X-ray light echo in the form of four well-defined rings with
radii from 5 to 13 arcminutes, growing in radius with time. The large fluence
of the flare and the large column density of interstellar dust towards Circinus
X-1 make this the largest and brightest set of rings from an X-ray light echo
observed to date. By deconvolving the radial intensity profile of the echo with
the MAXI X-ray lightcurve of the flare we reconstruct the dust distribution
towards Circinus X-1 into four distinct dust concentrations. By comparing the
peak in scattering intensity with the peak intensity in CO maps of molecular
clouds from the Mopra Southern Galactic Plane CO Survey we identify the two
innermost rings with clouds at radial velocity ~ -74 km/s and ~ -81 km/s,
respectively. We identify a prominent band of foreground photoelectric
absorption with a lane of CO gas at ~ -32 km/s. From the association of the
rings with individual CO clouds we determine the kinematic distance to Circinus
X-1 to be $D_{Cir X-1} = 9.4^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ kpc. This distance rules out
earlier claims of a distance around 4 kpc, implies that Circinus X-1 is a
frequent super-Eddington source, and places a lower limit of $\Gamma \gtrsim

Sagittarius stream). Compared to BHB stars or RR Lyrae, giants are more readily
understood tracers of the overall halo star population, with less bias in age
or metallicity. The well-characterized selection function of the sample enables
forward modelling of those data, based on ellipsoidal stellar density models,
$\nu_* (R,z)$, with Einasto profiles and (broken) power laws for their radial
dependence, combined with a model for the metallicity gradient and the
flattening profile. Among models with constant flattening, these data are
reasonably well fit by an Einasto profile of $n=3.1\pm 0.5$ with an effective
radius $\rm r_{eff} = 15\pm2~$kpc and a flattening of $q=0.7\pm 0.02$; or
comparably well by an equally flattened broken power-law, with radial slopes of
$\alpha_{in}=2.1\pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{out}=3.8\pm 0.1$, with a break-radius of
$r_{break}=18\pm1$~kpc; this is largely consistent with earlier work. We find a
modest, but significant metallicity gradient within the ""outer"" stellar halo,
$\rm [Fe/H]$ decreasing outward. If we allow for a variable flattening $q =

flattened at small radii, $q({\rm 10~kpc})\sim 0.57$, compared to $q(>30{\rm

power-law of index $\rm \sim 4.2\pm0.1$ of the variable
$r_q\equiv\sqrt{R^2+(z/q(r))^2}$. In this simple and better fitting model,
there is a break in flattening at $\sim 20$~kpc, instead of a break in the

conjunction with DMFT to a number of heavy-fermion, actinide, transition metal

framework of impurity models pointed out to serious deficiencies of OCA and
raised questions regarding its reliability. Here we consider a single band
Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice at finite temperatures and compare the
results of OCA to those of a numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
method. The temperature-local repulsion U phase diagram for the particle-hole
symmetric case obtained by OCA is in good agreement with that of QMC, with the
metal-insulator transition captured very well. We find, however, that the
insulator to metal transition is shifted to higher values of U and,
simultaneously, correlations in the metallic phase are significantly
overestimated. This counter-intuitive behavior is due to simultaneous
underestimations of the Kondo scale in the metallic phase and the size of the
insulating gap. We trace the underestimation of the insulating gap to that of
the second moment of the high-frequency expansion of the impurity spectral
density. Calculations for the system away from the particle-hole symmetric case
are also presented and discussed.

recent years. The diversity of formats, genres, and producers makes it
difficult to formulate a universal definition of science web videos since not
every producer considers him- or herself to be a science communicator in an
institutional sense, and professionalism and success on video platforms no
longer depend exclusively on technical excellence or production costs.
Entertainment, content quality, and authenticity have become the keys to
community building and success. The democratization of science video production
allows a new variety of genres, styles, and forms. This article provides a
first overview of the typologies and characteristics of popular science web
videos. To avoid a misleading identification of science web videos with
institutionally produced videos, we steer clear of the term science
communication video, since many of the actual producers are not even familiar
with the academic discussion on science communication, and since the subject
matter does not depend on political or educational strategies. A content
analysis of 200 videos from 100 online video channels was conducted. Several
factors such as narrative strategies, video editing techniques, and design
tendencies with regard to cinematography, the number of shots, the kind of
montage used, and even the spread use of sound design and special FX point to
an increasing professionalism among science communicators independent of
institutional or personal commitments: in general, it can be said that supposed
amateurs are creating the visual language of science video communication. This
study represents an important step in understanding the essence of current
popular science web videos and provides an evidence-based definition as a
helpful cornerstone for further studies on science communication within this
kind of new media.

sensitive to large-scale structure on all baselines. This is due to the
inherent response of a wide-field instrument and is characterized by enhanced
power from foreground emission in Fourier modes adjacent to those considered to
be the most sensitive to the cosmological H I signal. In our recent paper, many
signatures from the simulation that predicted this feature were validated
against Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) data, but this key pitchfork signature
was close to the noise level. In this paper, we improve the data sensitivity
through the coherent averaging of 12 independent snapshots with identical
instrument settings and provide the first confirmation of the prediction with a

antenna designs that suppress sensitivity near the horizon. Simple models for
antenna apertures that have been proposed for future instruments such as the

they should suppress foreground leakage from the pitchfork by ~40 dB relative

  Our arguments build on work of Gustafson, Nakanishi, and Tsai on the
(defocusing) Gross--Pitaevskii equation. The presence of an energy-critical
nonlinearity and changes in the geometry of the energy functional add several
new complexities. One new ingredient in our argument is a demonstration that
solutions of such (perturbed) energy-critical equations exhibit continuous
dependence on the initial data with respect to the \emph{weak} topology on
$H^1_x$.

bosons arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking is an interesting hypothesis
which would provide a dynamical setting for the gauge principle. We investigate
this proposal in the framework of a general $% SO(N)$ non-abelian Nambu model
(NANM), effectively providing spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in terms of
the corresponding Goldstone bosons. Using a non-perturbative Hamiltonian
analysis, we prove that the $SO(N)$ Yang--Mills theory is equivalent to the
corresponding NANM, after current conservation together with the Gauss laws are
imposed as initial conditions for the latter. This equivalence is independent
of any gauge fixing in the YM theory. A substantial conceptual and practical
improvement in the analysis arises by choosing a particular parametrization
that solves the non-linear constraint defining the NANM. This choice allows us
to show that the relation between the NANM canonical variables and the
corresponding ones of the YM theory, $A_{i}^{a}$ and $E^{bj}$, is given by a
canonical transformation. In terms of the latter variables, the NANM
Hamiltonian has the same form as the YM Hamiltonian, except that the Gauss laws
do not arise as first class constraints. The dynamics of the NANM further
guarantees that it is sufficient to impose them only as initial conditions, in
order to recover the full equivalence. It is interesting to observe that this

dose calculation or in resourse allocation problems. But it is practical to
change control value in some time section that lead to stepwise control
function. We study some examples via classical Pontrya- gin Maximum

obtained during a cross-calibration campaign with the \textit{Chandra},

data from all observatories except \textit{INTEGRAL} over the 1--78\,keV band,
leaves significant residuals in the \textit{NuSTAR} data between 30--78\,keV.
The \nustar\ 3--78\,keV spectrum is well-described by an exponentially cutoff
power-law ($\Gamma = 1.646 \pm 0.006$, E$_\mathrm{cutoff} =
202_{-34}^{+51}$\,keV) with a weak reflection component from cold, dense
material. There is also evidence for a weak ($EW = 23 \pm 11$ eV) neutral iron
line. We interpret these features as arising from coronal emission plus
reflection off an accretion disk or distant material. Beyond 80\,keV
\textit{INTEGRAL} data show clear excess flux relative to an extrapolation of
the AGN model fit to \nustar. This high-energy power-law is consistent with the
presence of a beamed jet, which begins to dominate over emission from the inner
accretion flow at 30-40 keV. Modeling the jet locally (in the \textit{NuSTAR} +
\textit{INTEGRAL} band) as a power-law, we find the coronal component is fit by
$\Gamma_\mathrm{AGN} = 1.638 \pm 0.045$, $E_\mathrm{cutoff} = 47 \pm 15$\,keV,
and jet photon index by $\Gamma_\mathrm{jet} = 1.05 \pm 0.4$. We also consider

well as improve the resolution. But the method is limited by its huge
computation requirement and thus cannot be implemented in actual data
reduction. In this article, we develop a practical computation method to solve
the computation problem. The new computation method can deconvolve a 2D fiber
spectral image of any size with actual PSFs, which may vary with positions. Our
method does not require large amounts of memory and can extract a 4k multi 4k
noise-free CCD image with 250 fibers in 2 hr. To make our method more
practical, we further consider the influence of noise, which is thought to be
an intrinsic illposed problem in deconvolution algorithms. We modify our method
with a Tikhonov regularization item to depress the method induced noise.
Compared with the results of traditional extraction methods, our method has the
least residual and influence by cross talk and noise, even for extreme
situation. Our method can convergent in 2 to 4 iterations, and the computation
times are about 3.5 hr for the extreme fiber distance and about 2 hr for
nonextreme cases. Finally, we apply our method to real LAMOST (Large sky Area

random sample of sites is selected; the people in the sampled sites are
identified and are asked to name other members of the population which are
added to the sample. Those authors proposed maximum likelihood estimators of
the population size which derived from a multinomial model for the numbers of

purely photometric methods. Heartbeat stars in this sample have A- or F-type
primary components. Constraints on orbital inclinations indicate that four of

secondaries are probable M dwarfs or earlier. One system is an eclipsing,
double-lined spectroscopic binary with roughly equal-mass mid-A components

support the idea that photometric data are sufficient to derive reliable

transport through biological ion channels. Our goal is to deal with the finite
size of particle using a Fermi like distribution without calculating the forces
between the particles, because they are both expensive and tricky to compute.
We include the steric effect of ions and water molecules with nonuniform sizes
and interstitial voids, the correlation effect of crowded ions with different
valences, and the screening effect of water molecules in an inhomogeneous
aqueous electrolyte. Including the finite volume of water and the voids between
particles is an important new part of the theory presented here. Fermi like
distributions of all particle species are derived from the volume exclusion of
classical particles. The classical Gibbs entropy is extended to a new entropy
form --- called Gibbs-Fermi entropy --- that describes mixing configurations of
all finite size particles and voids in a thermodynamic system where microstates
do not have equal probabilities. The PNPF model describes the dynamic flow of
ions, water molecules, as well as voids with electric fields and protein
charges. The PNPF results are in good accord with experimental currents
recorded in a 10^8-fold range of Ca++ concentrations. The results illustrate
the anomalous mole fraction effect, a signature of L-type calcium channels.
Moreover, numerical results concerning water density, dielectric permittivity,
void volume, and steric energy provide useful details to study a variety of
physical mechanisms ranging from binding, to permeation, blocking, flexibility,
and charge/space competition of the channel.

object proposals is predicted as efficiently as possible, and (2) this set of
candidate proposals is then passed to an object classifier. Such approaches
have been shown they can be fast, while achieving the state of the art in
detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new way to generate object
proposals, introducing an approach based on a discriminative convolutional
network. Our model is trained jointly with two objectives: given an image
patch, the first part of the system outputs a class-agnostic segmentation mask,
while the second part of the system outputs the likelihood of the patch being
centered on a full object. At test time, the model is efficiently applied on
the whole test image and generates a set of segmentation masks, each of them
being assigned with a corresponding object likelihood score. We show that our
model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art object proposal
algorithms. In particular, compared to previous approaches, our model obtains
substantially higher object recall using fewer proposals. We also show that our
model is able to generalize to unseen categories it has not seen during

TeV cosmic ray (CR) data to probe possible foreground residuals in the WMAP
nine-year data. The correlation results between the CR and foreground-contained
maps (WMAP foreground-unreduced maps, WMAP template-based and MEM foreground

least some TeV CRs originate from the Milky Way; (3) foregrounds may be related
to the existence of CR anisotropy (loss-cone and tail-in structures); (4) there
exist differences among different types of foregrounds in the declination range
of $< 15^{\circ}$. Then, we generate 10,000 mock CMB sky maps to describe the
cosmic variance, which is used to measure the effect of the fluctuations of all
possible CMB maps to the correlations between CR and CMB maps. Finally, we do
correlation analysis between the CR and WMAP foreground-reduced maps, and find
that: (1) there are significant anticorrelations; and (2) the WMAP
foreground-reduced maps are credible. However, the significant anticorrelations
may be accidental, and the higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Planck SMICA map
cannot reject the hypothesis of accidental correlations. We therefore can only

  Cognitive Radio Networks",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a spectrum monitoring algorithm for Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based cognitive radios by which the primary user
reappearance can be detected during the secondary user transmission. The
proposed technique reduces the frequency with which spectrum sensing must be
performed and greatly decreases the elapsed time between the start of a primary
transmission and its detection by the secondary network. This is done by
sensing the change in signal strength over a number of reserved OFDM
sub-carriers so that the reappearance of the primary user is quickly detected.
Moreover, the OFDM impairments such as power leakage, Narrow Band Interference
(NBI), and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) are investigated and their impact
on the proposed technique is studied. Both analysis and simulation show that
the \emph{energy ratio} algorithm can effectively and accurately detect the
appearance of the primary user. Furthermore, our method achieves high immunity
to frequency-selective fading channels for both single and multiple receive
antenna systems, with a complexity that is approximately twice that of a
conventional energy detector.

to choose a relay node from a set of relays, as they ephemerally become
available (e.g., wake up from a sleep state). Each relay, when it arrives,
offers a (possibly different) ""reward"" to each forwarder. Each forwarder's
objective is to minimize a combination of the delay incurred in choosing a
relay and the reward offered by the chosen relay. As an example, we develop the
reward structure for the specific problem of geographical forwarding over a
network of sleep-wake cycling relays.
  We study two variants of the generic relay selection problem, namely, the
completely observable (CO) case where, when a relay arrives, both forwarders
get to observe both rewards, and the partially observable (PO) case where each
forwarder can only observe its own reward. Formulating the problem as a two
person stochastic game, we characterize solution in terms of Nash Equilibrium
Policy Pairs (NEPPs). For the CO case we provide a general structure of the
NEPPs. For the PO case we prove that there exists an NEPP within the class of
threshold policy pairs.
  We then consider the particular application of geographical forwarding of
packets in a shared network of sleep-wake cycling wireless relays. For this
problem, for a particular reward structure, using realistic parameter values
corresponding to TelosB wireless mote, we numerically compare the performance
(in terms of cost to both forwarders) of the various NEPPs and draw the
following key insight: even for moderate separation between the two forwarders,
the performance of the various NEPPs is close to the performance of a simple
strategy where each forwarder behaves as if the other forwarder is not present.
We also conduct simulation experiments to study the end-to-end performance of
the simple forwarding policy.

running of a coupling constant associated to the $R^2$ term in
higher-derivative gravity, which, depending on the UV completion of the theory,
can be asymptotically free in the ultraviolet and strongly coupled in the
infrared. In this scenario the mass scale $m$ of the non-local model emerges
from dimensional transmutation, similarly to $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ for strong
interactions, leading to a technically natural value and to a novel
understanding of the scale associated to dark energy. Motivated by these
findings, we then explore the possibility of generating strong infrared effects
in Einstein gravity, with no $R^2$ terms, as a consequence of the

characteristics of Landau levels, including the degeneracy, wave functions,
quantum numbers, onset energies, field-dependent energy spectra,
semiconductor-metal transitions, and crossing patterns, which are reflected in
the magneto-optical spectroscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and quantum
transport experiments. The Landau levels in AA-stacked graphene are responsible
for multiple Dirac cones, while in AB-stacked graphene the Dirac properties
depend on the number of graphene layers, and in ABC-stacked graphene the
low-lying levels are related to surface states. The Landau-level mixing leads
to anticrossings patterns in energy spectra, which are seen for intergroup
Landau levels in AB-stacked graphene, while in particular, a formation of both
intergroup and intragroup anticrossings is observed in ABC-stacked graphene.
The aforementioned magneto-electronic properties lead to diverse optical

for the Noordin Top terrorist network nodes yields more extreme differences

thorium nitrate on the surface of CaF2. The chemical state of the atoms and the
change of the band structure in the surface layers of Th/CaF2 system on CaF2
substrate were investigated by XPS and REELS techniques. It was found that
REELS spectra for Th/CaF2 system include peaks in the region of low energy
losses (3-7 eV) which are missing in the similar spectra for pure CaF2. It is
concluded that the presence of the observed features in the REELS spectra is
associated with the chemical state of thorium atoms and is caused by the
presence of uncompensated chemical bonds at the Th/CaF2 interface, and,
therefore, by the presence of unbound 6d- and 7s-electrons of thorium atoms.
Assuming the equivalence of the electronic configuration of thorium-229 and
thorium-232 atoms, an estimate was made on the time decay of the excited state
of thorium-229 nuclei through the channel of the electron conversion. It was
found that the relaxation time is about 40 {\mu}s for 6d-electrons, and about 1
{\mu}s for 7s-electrons.

describe the motion of a small compact object through a vacuum background to
any order in perturbation theory. The schemes are based on rigorous methods of
matched asymptotic expansions, which account for the object's finite size,
require no ""regularization"" of divergent quantities, and are valid for strong
fields and relativistic speeds. Up to couplings of the object's multipole
moments to the external background curvature, these schemes have established
that at least through second order in perturbation theory, the object's motion
satisfies a generalized equivalence principle: it moves on a geodesic of a
certain smooth metric satisfying the vacuum Einstein equation. I describe the
foundations of this result, particularly focusing on the fundamental notion of
how a small object's motion is represented in perturbation theory. The three
common representations of perturbed motion are (i) the ""Gralla-Wald""
description in terms of small deviations from a reference geodesic, (ii) the
""self-consistent"" description in terms of a worldline that obeys a
self-accelerated equation of motion, and (iii) the ""osculating geodesics""
description, which utilizes both (i) and (ii). Because of the coordinate
freedom in general relativity, any coordinate description of motion in
perturbation theory is intimately related to the theory's gauge freedom. In
this review I describe asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations adapted
to each of the three representations of motion, and I discuss the gauge freedom
associated with each. I conclude with a discussion of how gauge freedom must be
refined in the context of long-term dynamics.

moonlight. Observations with the VERITAS telescopes in the standard
configuration are performed only with a moon illumination less than 35$\%$ of
full moon. Since 2012, the VERITAS collaboration has implemented a new
observing mode under bright moonlight, by either reducing the voltage applied
to the PMTs (reduced-high-voltage configuration, RHV), or by utilizing
UV-transparent filters. While these operating modes result in lower sensitivity
and increased energy thresholds, the extension of the available observing time
is useful for monitoring variable sources such as blazars and sources requiring
spectral measurements at the highest energies. In this paper we report the
detection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the BL Lac object 1ES 1727+502

variability from this blazar. The integral flux is
$(1.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 250 GeV, which is about
five times higher than the low-flux state. The detection triggered additional
\veritas\ observations during standard dark-time. Multiwavelength observations
with the FLWO 48"" telescope, and the Swift and Fermi satellites are presented
and used to produce the first spectral energy distribution (SED) of this object
during $\gamma$-ray flaring activity. The SED is then fitted with a standard
synchrotron-self-Compton model, placing constraints on the properties of the
emitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of the
relativistic particle population in the jet.

hardware it will eventually run on in numerous mobile phones, tablets,
desktops, laptops, data centers, supercomputers and cloud services.
Unfortunately, optimizing compilers are not keeping pace with ever increasing
complexity of computer systems anymore and may produce severely underperforming
executable codes while wasting expensive resources and energy.
  We present our practical and collaborative solution to this problem via
light-weight wrappers around any software piece when more than one
implementation or optimization choice available. These wrappers are connected
with a public Collective Mind autotuning infrastructure and repository of
knowledge (c-mind.org/repo) to continuously monitor various important
characteristics of these pieces (computational species) across numerous
existing hardware configurations together with randomly selected optimizations.
Similar to natural sciences, we can now continuously track winning solutions
(optimizations for a given hardware) that minimize all costs of a computation
(execution time, energy spent, code size, failures, memory and storage
footprint, optimization time, faults, contentions, inaccuracy and so on) of a
given species on a Pareto frontier along with any unexpected behavior. The
community can then collaboratively classify solutions, prune redundant ones,
and correlate them with various features of software, its inputs (data sets)
and used hardware either manually or using powerful predictive analytics
techniques. Our approach can then help create a large, realistic, diverse,
representative, and continuously evolving benchmark with related optimization
knowledge while gradually covering all possible software and hardware to be
able to predict best optimizations and improve compilers and hardware depending
on usage scenarios and requirements.

simulations requires a distance metric that can distinguish

define a kinetic distance for irreducible Markov processes that quantifies how
slowly molecular conformations interconvert. The kinetic distance can be
computed given a model that approximates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
(reaction coordinates) of the MD Markov operator. Here we employ the
time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA). The TICA components can be
scaled to provide a kinetic map in which the Euclidean distance corresponds to
the kinetic distance. As a result, the question of how many TICA dimensions
should be kept in a dimensionality reduction approach becomes obsolete, and one
parameter less needs to be specified in the kinetic model construction. We
demonstrate the approach using TICA and Markov state model (MSM) analyses for
illustrative models, protein conformation dynamics in bovine pancreatic trypsin
inhibitor and protein-inhibitor association in trypsin and benzamidine.

fields of one SU(2) doublet ($\phi_1$) act in an identical way to the standard
model Higgs while the component fields of the second SU(2) doublet ($\phi_2$)
are taken to be the dark energy candidate (which is done by assuming that the

arrange for late time acceleration (dark energy) by using an SU(2) Higgs

zero, in the quintessential regime.
