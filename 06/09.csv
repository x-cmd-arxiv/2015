free energy of the system with respect to the mean atomic coordinates

step where atoms and vacancies (or two species in a binary alloy) flow on a
diffusive time scale via a master equation. We present a mathematical framework
for studying this algorithm based upon relative entropy, or Kullback-Leibler
divergence. This adds flexibility in how the algorithm is implemented and

expense of the optimal Bayesian multi-target filtering by approximating the

as a powerful decluttering algorithm, it suffers from lack of the precise
estimation of the expected number of targets. The cardinalized PHD (CPHD)
recursion, as a generalization of the PHD recursion, is to remedy this flaw,
which jointly propagates the intensity function and the posterior cardinality
distribution. While there are a few new approaches to enhance the Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC) implementation of the PHD filter, current SMC implementation
for the CPHD filter suffers from poor performance in terms of accuracy of
estimate. In this paper, based on the unscented transform (UT), we propose an
auxiliary implementation of the CPHD filter for highly nonlinear systems. To
that end, we approximate the elementary symmetric functions both with the
predicted and with the update estimate of the linear functional. We
subsequently demonstrate via numerical simulations that our algorithms
significantly out performs both the SMC-CPHD filter and the auxiliary particle

reconstructing geometric objects with probing devices. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of using an $\omega$-wedge probing tool to determine
the exact shape and orientation of a convex polygon. An $\omega$-wedge consists
of two rays emanating from a point called the apex of the wedge and the two
rays forming an angle $\omega$. To probe with an $\omega$-wedge, we set the
direction that the apex of the probe has to follow, the line $\overrightarrow
L$, and the initial orientation of the two rays. A valid $\omega$-probe of a
convex polygon $O$ contains $O$ within the $\omega$-wedge and its outcome
consists of the coordinates of the apex, the orientation of both rays and the
coordinates of the closest (to the apex) points of contact between $O$ and each
of the rays.
  We present algorithms minimizing the number of probes and prove their
optimality. In particular, we show how to reconstruct a convex $n$-gon (with
all internal angles of size larger than $\omega$) using $2n-2$ $\omega$-probes;
if $\omega = \pi/2$, the reconstruction uses $2n-3$ $\omega$-probes. We show
that both results are optimal. Let $N_B$ be the number of vertices of $O$ whose
internal angle is at most $\omega$, (we show that $0 \leq N_B \leq 3$). We
determine the shape and orientation of a general convex $n$-gon with $N_B=1$
(respectively $N_B=2$, $N_B=3$) using $2n-1$ (respectively $2n+3$, $2n+5$)
$\omega$-probes. We prove optimality for the first case. Assuming the algorithm
knows the value of $N_B$ in advance, the reconstruction of $O$ with $N_B=2$ or
$N_B=3$ can be achieved with $2n+2$ probes,- which is optimal.

histograms. Existing notions of distances between distributions are not
suitable, since they ignore infrequent degrees in the tail. The Relative
Hausdorff distance measures deviations at all scales, and is a more suitable
distance for comparing degree distributions. By tracking this new measure, we

regarding the role of the beam coherence in the formation of the diffraction

simulate the diffraction patterns of dense two-dimensional monodisperse systems
of different symmetries, varying the transverse coherence of the probing wave,
and analyze their CCF. We study samples with different symmetries at different
size scale, as for example, pentamers arranged into a four-fold lattice where
each pentamer is surrounded by triangular lattices, both ordered and
disordered. In such systems, different symmetry modulations are arising in the
CCF at specific scattering vectors. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the
CCF is a fingerprint of the degree of the ordering in the sample and that at
partial transverse coherence, the CCF of a dense sample corresponds to that of
an individual scattering object.

Data Description (SVDD) based anomaly detection is presented. In this work,
optimal sparse feature selection for anomaly detection is first modeled as a
Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Due to the prohibitively high
computational complexity of the MIP, it is relaxed into a Quadratically
Constrained Linear Programming (QCLP) problem. The QCLP problem can then be
practically solved by using an iterative optimization method, in which multiple
subsets of features are iteratively found as opposed to a single subset. The
QCLP-based iterative optimization problem is solved in a finite space called
the \emph{Empirical Kernel Feature Space} (EKFS) instead of in the input space
or \emph{Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space} (RKHS). This is possible because of
the fact that the geometrical properties of the EKFS and the corresponding RKHS
remain the same. Now, an explicit nonlinear exploitation of the data in a
finite EKFS is achievable, which results in optimal feature ranking.
Experimental results based on a hyperspectral image show that the proposed
method can provide improved performance over the current state-of-the-art
techniques.

self-gravity forming sink particles, adopting an isothermal equation of state
to isolate the effects of gravity from thermal physics on the resulting sink
mass distributions. Simulations starting with supersonic velocity fluctuations
develop sink mass functions with a high-mass power-law tail $dN/d\log M \propto
M^{\Gamma}$, $\Gamma = -1 \pm 0.1$, independent of the initial Mach number of
the velocity field. Similar results but with weaker statistical significance
hold for a simulation starting with initial density fluctuations. This mass
function power-law dependence agrees with the asymptotic limit found by
Zinnecker assuming Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton (BHL) accretion, even though the mass
accretion rates of individual sinks show significant departures from the
predicted $\mdot \propto M^2$ behavior. While BHL accretion is not strictly
applicable due to the complexity of the environment, we argue that the final
mass functions are the result of a {\em relative} $M^2$ dependence resulting
from gravitationally-focused accretion. Our simulations may show the power-law
mass function particularly clearly compared with others because our adoption of
an isothermal equation of state limits the effects of thermal physics in
producing a broad initial fragmentation spectrum; $\Gamma \rightarrow -1$ is an
asymptotic limit found only when sink masses grow well beyond their initial
values. While we have purposely eliminated many additional physical processes
(radiative transfer, feedback) which can affect the stellar mass function, our
results emphasize the importance of gravitational focusing for massive star
formation.

Treating Interference as Noise without Time Sharing (TINnoTS) achieves the
closure of the capacity region to within either a constant gap, or to within a
gap of the order O(logln(min(S,I))) where S is the largest Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) on the direct links and I is the largest Interference to Noise
Ratio (INR) on the cross links. As a consequence, TINnoTS is optimal from a
generalized Degrees of Freedom (gDoF) perspective for all channel gains except
for a subset of zero measure. TINnoTS with Gaussian inputs is known to be
optimal to within 1/2 bit for a subset of the weak interference regime.
Surprisingly, this paper shows that TINnoTS is gDoG optimal in all parameter
regimes, even in the strong and very strong interference regimes where joint
decoding of Gaussian inputs is optimal. For approximate optimality of TINnoTS
in all parameter regimes it is critical to use non-Gaussian inputs. This work
thus proposes to use mixed inputs as channel inputs where a mixed input is the
sum of a discrete and a Gaussian random variable. Interestingly, compared to
the Han-Kobayashi inner bound, the discrete part of a mixed input is shown to
effectively act as a common message in the sense that, although treated as
noise, its effect on the achievable rate region is as if it were jointly
decoded together with the desired messages at a non-intended receiver. The
practical implication is that a discrete interfering input is a 'friend', while
a Gaussian interfering input is in general a 'foe'. Since TINnoTS requires
neither joint decoding nor time sharing, the results of this paper are
applicable to a variety of oblivions or asynchronous channels, such as the
block asynchronous G-IC (which is not an information stable) and the G-IC with
partial codebook knowledge at one or more receivers.

analysis of the data of the three Micromegas detectors during the 2011 data
taking campaign at CAST is presented in this thesis, obtaining a limit on the
coupling constant of g$_{a \gamma}$ < 3.90 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at a
95$\%$ of confidence level, for axion masses from 1 to 1.17 eV. CAST Micromegas
detectors exploit different strategies developed for the reduction of the
background level. Moreover, different test benches have been developed in order
to understand the origin of the background. The state of art in low background
techniques is shown in the upgrades of the Micromegas detectors at CAST, which
has led to a reduction of the background in a factor $\sim$6. It translates in
an improvement of the sensitivity of CAST in a factor $\sim$2.5. Beyond CAST a
new generation axion helioscope has been proposed: IAXO-the International Axion
Observatory. IAXO will enhance the helioscope technique by exploiting all the
singularities of CAST implemented into a large superconducting toroidal magnet,
dedicated X-ray optics and ultra-low background detectors. A description of the
IAXO proposal and the study of the sensitivity of IAXO are presented in this

the mixing angles of the leptonic sector are proportional to that of the quark

leptonic mixing angles are proportional to the quark mixing angles at the
unification scale by taking into account the latest experimental constraints
from the neutrino sector. These relations are able to explain the pattern of
leptonic mixing at the low scale and thereby hint that these relations could be

subfactor $N\subset M$, or equivalently the Drinfeld center of the even part
fusion category, is a unitary modular tensor category. Thus should arise in
conformal field theory. We show that for every subfactor $N\subset M$ with
index $[M:N]<4$ the quantum double $D(N\subset M)$ is realized as the
representation category of a completely rational conformal net. In particular,
the quantum double of $E_6$ can be realized as a $\mathbb Z_2$-simple current
extension of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{10}\times \mathrm{Spin}(11)_1$ and thus is not
exotic in any sense. As a byproduct we obtain a vertex operator algebra for
every such subfactor.
  We obtain the result by showing that if a subfactor $N\subset M $ arises from
$\alpha$-induction of completely rational nets $\mathcal A\subset \mathcal B$
and there is a net $\tilde{\mathcal A}$ with the opposite braiding, then the
quantum $D(N\subset M)$ is realized by completely rational net. We construct
completely rational nets with the opposite braiding of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and
use the well-known fact that all subfactors with index $[M:N]<4$ arise by
$\alpha$-induction from $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$.

and most importantly, we have calculated the scalability of the spectra. To do
this, we implement and propose scaling rules for each one of the fundamental
parameters: generation number, height of the barriers and length of the system.
With this in mind we have been able to reproduce the reference transmission
spectrum, applying the appropriate scaling rule, by means of the scaled
transmission spectrum. These scaling rules are valid for both normal and
oblique incidence, and as far as we can see the basic ingredients to obtain
self-similar characteristics are: relativistic Dirac electrons, a self-similar
structure and the non-conservation of the pseudo-spin. This constitutes a
reduction of the number of conditions needed to observe self-similarity in
graphene-based structures, see D\'iaz-Guerrero et al. [D. S. D\'iaz-Guerrero,

introduced in previous works, is considered here to just propose a theory which
includes Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) terms in its defining action in a
renormalizable form. The Lagrangian includes a special kind of new vertices
which at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability.
However, these terms also modify the quark propagators, to become more
decreasing that the Dirac propagator at large momenta, indicating that the
theory is renormalizable. Therefore, it follows the surprising conclusion that
the added NJL four fermions terms does not break renormalizability. The
approach, can also be interpreted as a slightly generalized renormalization
procedure for massless QCD, which seems able to incorporate the mass generating
properties for the quarks of the NJL model, in a renormalizable way. The
structure of the free propagator, given by the substraction between a massive
and a massless Dirac one in the Lee-Wick form, also suggests that the theory
retains unitarity, if the radiative corrections make the massless quarks become
non propagating. The appearance of finite masses in the theory is justified by
the fact that the new action terms break chiral invariance. The scheme looks as
being able to implement the Fritzsch Democratic Symmetry breaking approach to
quark mass hierarchy. It seems also possible to further link the theory with
the SM after employing the Zimmermann's coupling constant reduction scheme in a
similar way as the Top quark condensation model had been approximately
reformulated as a Higgs field one.

the relationships among the turnoff wave bands lambda_turnoff (longward of

excess spectral index alpha_excess at lambda <~ 24 microns, and the disk inner
radius R_in (from SED modeling) for YSOs of different evolutionary stages, we
found that the median and standard deviation of alpha_excess of YSOs with
optically thick disks tend to increase with lambda_turnoff, especially at
lambda_turnoff >= 5.8 microns, whereas the median fractional dust luminosities
L_dust/L_star tend to decrease with lambda_turnoff. This points to an
inside-out disk clearing of small dust grains. Moreover, a positive correlation
between alpha_excess and R_in was found at alpha_excess > ~0 and R_in > ~10
$\times$ the dust sublimation radius R_sub, irrespective of lambda_turnoff,
L_dust/L_star and disk flaring. This suggests that the outer disk flaring
either does not evolve synchronously with the inside-out disk clearing or has
little influence on alpha_excess shortward of 24 microns. About 23% of our YSO
disks are classified as transitional disks, which have lambda_turnoff >= 5.8
microns and L_dust/L_star >10^(-3). The transitional disks and full disks
occupy distinctly different regions on the L_dust/L_star vs. alpha_excess
diagram. Taking L_dust/L_star as an approximate discriminator of disks with
(>0.1) and without (<0.1) considerable accretion activity, we found that 65%

of quality of equilibria. Our main contribution is a new and more optimistic
view on locality: agents are limited in their knowledge and actions to their
local view ranges, but can probe different strategies and finally choose the
best. We study the influence of our locality notion on the hardness of

Moreover, we compare the strength of local versus non-local strategy-changes.

tensor equivalent to the well known quotient C^*-category of the category of
tilting modules of the non-semisimple quantum group U_q({\mathfrak sl}_N) of
Drinfeld, Jimbo and Lusztig.
  As an algebra, the C^*-groupoid is a quotient of U_q({\mathfrak sl}_N). As a
coalgebra, it naturally reflects the categorical quotient construction. In
particular, it is not coassociative, but satisfies axioms of the weak
quasi-Hopf C^*-algebras: quasi-coassociativity and non-unitality of the
coproduct. There are also a multiplicative counit, an antipode, and an
R-matrix.
  For this, we give a general construction of quantum groupoids for complex

tools here are Drinfeld's coboundary associated to the R-matrix, related to the
algebra involution, and certain canonical projections introduced by Wenzl,

Tensorial properties of the negligible modules reflect in a rather special
nature of the associator. We next reduce the proof of the categorical
equivalence to the problems of establishing semisimplicity and computing
dimension of the groupoid. In the case {\mathfrak g}={\mathfrak sl}_N we
construct a (non-positive) Haar-type functional on an associative version of

corresponding scientific benefits, including revealing the central engine
powering the gamma-ray burst, enhanced confidence in the event as a genuine
astrophysical detection, and a determination of the relative speed of the

Formal approaches to understanding this problem focus on statistical inference
and generalization of individual analysis procedures. Yet the practice of data
analysis is an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and
hypotheses are proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters
are tuned on the basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused.
An investigation of this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in
(Dwork et al., 2014), where we focused on the problem of estimating
expectations of adaptively chosen functions.
  In this paper, we give a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout
(or testing) set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning
algorithm operating on a training set. Reusing a holdout set adaptively
multiple times can easily lead to overfitting to the holdout set itself. We
give an algorithm that enables the validation of a large number of adaptively
chosen hypotheses, while provably avoiding overfitting. We illustrate the
advantages of our algorithm over the standard use of the holdout set via a
simple synthetic experiment.
  We also formalize and address the general problem of data reuse in adaptive
data analysis. We show how the differential-privacy based approach given in
(Dwork et al., 2014) is applicable much more broadly to adaptive data analysis.
We then show that a simple approach based on description length can also be
used to give guarantees of statistical validity in adaptive settings. Finally,
we demonstrate that these incomparable approaches can be unified via the notion
of approximate max-information that we introduce.

results permit to obtain simple expressions for the matrix elements of local
operators (form factors). However, these representations have been obtained up
to now only for the completely inhomogeneous versions of the lattice models
considered. In this article we give a simple algebraic procedure to rewrite the
scalar products (and hence the form factors) for the SoV related models as
Izergin or Slavnov type determinants. This new form leads to simple expressions
for the form factors in the homogeneous and thermodynamic limits. To make the
presentation of our method clear, we have chosen to explain it first for the
simple case of the $XXX$ Heisenberg chain with anti-periodic boundary

The RL setting presents two particular challenges when CPT is applied:
estimating the CPT objective requires estimations of the entire distribution of
the value function and finding a randomized optimal policy. The estimation
scheme that we propose uses the empirical distribution to estimate the
CPT-value of a random variable. We then use this scheme in the inner loop of a
CPT-value optimization procedure that is based on the well-known simulation

redistribution, coherent state merging, quantum state splitting, measurement
compression with quantum side information, randomness extraction against
quantum side information, and data compression with quantum side information.
The method we employ in proving these results extends ideas developed by Sharma
[arXiv:1404.5940], which he used to give a new proof of the strong converse
theorem for state merging. For state redistribution, we prove the strong
converse property for the boundary of the entire achievable rate region in the
$(e,q)$-plane, where $e$ and $q$ denote the entanglement cost and quantum
communication cost, respectively. In the case of measurement compression with
quantum side information, we prove a strong converse theorem for the classical
communication cost, which is a new result extending the previously known weak
converse. For the remaining tasks, we provide new proofs for strong converse
theorems previously established using smooth entropies. For each task, we
obtain the strong converse theorem from explicit bounds on the figure of merit
of the task in terms of a R\'enyi generalization of the optimal rate. Hence, we
identify candidates for the strong converse exponents for each task discussed
in this paper. To prove our results, we establish various new entropic
inequalities, which might be of independent interest. These involve conditional
entropies and mutual information derived from the sandwiched R\'enyi
divergence. In particular, we obtain novel bounds relating these quantities, as
well as the R\'enyi conditional mutual information, to the fidelity of two
quantum states.

nontrivial elements. A group $G$ is CSA or conjugately separated abelian if
maximal abelian subgroups are malnormal. These concepts have played a prominent
role in the studies of fully residually free groups, limit groups and
dicriminating groups. They were especially important in the solution to the
Tarski problems. CSA always implies CT however the class of CSA groups is a
proper subclass of the class of CT groups. For limit groups and finitely
generated elementary free groups they are equivalent. In this paper we examine
the relationship between the two concepts. In particular we show that a finite
CSA group must be abelian. If $G$ is CT then we prove that $G$ is not CSA if
and only if $G$ contains a nonabelian subgroup $G_0$ which contains a
nontrivial abelian subgroup $H$ that is normal in $G_0$. For $K$ a field the
group $PSL(2,K)$ is never CSA but is CT if char$(K) = 2$ and for fields $K$ of

characteristic $p$, for an odd prime $p$, $PSL(2,K)$ is never CT. Infinite CT

if a group $G$ is monolithic with monolith $N$ isomorphic to $PSL(2,K)$ for a

the local star formation measured by GALEX in Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host

these effects by using data from recent cosmological analyses to greatly
increase the SN Ia sample; we include 179 GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with
distances from the JLA and Pan-STARRS SN Ia cosmology samples and 157
GALEX-imaged SN Ia hosts with distances from the Riess et al. (2011) H$_0$
measurement. We find little evidence that SNe Ia in locally star-forming
environments are fainter after light curve correction than SNe Ia in locally
passive environments. We find a difference of only 0.000$\pm$0.018 (stat+sys)
mag for SNe fit with SALT2 and 0.029$\pm$0.027 (stat+sys) mag for SNe fit with
MLCS2k2 (R$_V$ = 2.5), which suggests that proposed changes to recent
measurements of H$_0$ and w are not significant and numerically smaller than
the parameter measurement uncertainties. We find the greatly reduced
significance of these distance modulus differences compared to Rigault et al.
(2013) and Rigault et al. (2015) result from two improvements with fairly equal
effects, our larger sample size and the use of JLA and Riess et al. (2011)
sample selection criteria. Without these improvements, we recover the results
of Rigault et al. (2015). We find that both populations have more similar
dispersion in distance than found by Rigault et al. (2013), Rigault et al.

passive SNe Ia fit with MLCS, the opposite of the effect seen by Rigault et al.

environments in the future may require a higher-resolution instrument than
GALEX and that SN sample selection has a significant effect on local star
formation biases.

perturbative gauge-Yukawa theories can have a strongly coupled limit at
high-energy, that can be mapped into a four-fermion theory. Interestingly, we
are able to precisely carve out a region of the perturbative parameter space
supporting such a composite limit. This has interesting implications on our
current view on models of particle physics. As a template model we use an
$SU(N_C)$ gauge theory with $N_F$ Dirac fermions transforming according to the
fundamental representation of the gauge group. The fermions further interact
with a gauge singlet complex $N_F\times N_F$ Higgs that ceases to be a physical
degree of freedom at the ultraviolet composite scale, where it gives away to
the four-fermion interactions. We compute the hierarchy between the ultraviolet
and infrared composite scales of the theory and show that they are naturally
large and well separated. Our results show that some weakly coupled

gradual increase through the bulge towards the centre. M32 displays flat

population models. We find that M31 is well described on all scales by a
Chabrier IMF, with a gradient in sodium enhancement of [Na/Fe] ~ +0.3 dex in
the outer bulge, rising within the central 10"" to perhaps [Na/Fe] ~ +1.0 dex in
the nuclear region. We find M32 is described by a Chabrier IMF and young
stellar age in line with other studies. Models show that CaT is much more
sensitive to metallicity and [{\alpha}/Fe] than to IMF. We note that the
centres of M31 and M32 have very high stellar densities and yet we measure
Chabrier IMFs in these regions.

following the collapse of the stars' iron cores. Poznanski (2013) has recently
suggested an observational correlation between the ejecta velocities and the
inferred masses of the red supergiant progenitors of type II-P explosions,
which implies that the kinetic energy of the ejecta ($E_{\textrm{kin}}$)
increases with the mass of the progenitor. I point out that the same conclusion
can be reached from the model-free observed correlation between the ejected
$^{56}$Ni masses ($M_{\textrm{Ni}}$) and the luminosities of the progenitors
for type II supernovae, which was reported by Fraser et al. (2011). This
correlation is in an agreement with the predictions of the collapse-induced
thermonuclear explosions (CITE) for CCSNe and in a possible contradiction with
the predictions of the neutrino mechanism. I show that a correlation between
$M_{\textrm{Ni}}$ and $E_{\textrm{kin}}$ holds for all types of CCSNe
(including type Ibc). This correlation suggests a common mechanism for all
CCSNe, which is predicted for CITE, but is not produced by current simulations
of the neutrino mechanism. Furthermore, the typical values of
$E_{\textrm{kin}}$ and $M_{\textrm{Ni}}$ for type Ibc explosions are larger by
an order of a magnitude than the typical values for II-P explosions, a fact
which disfavors progenitors with the same initial mass range for these
explosions. Instead, the progenitors of type Ibc explosions could be massive
Wolf-Rayet stars, which are predicted to yield strong explosions with low
ejecta masses (as observed) according to CITE. In this case, there is no
deficit of high mass progenitors for CCSNe, which was suggested under the
assumption of a similar mass range for the progenitors of types II-P and Ibc
supernovae.

common to known forms of hadronic calorimeters (HCAL). We argue that
substructure variables cannot use HCAL information to access the microscopic
nature of jets much narrower than the hadronic shower size, which we call
superboosted massive jets. It implies that roughly 15% of their transverse
energy profile remains inaccessible due to the presence of long-lived neutral
hadrons. This part of the jet substructure is also subject to order-one
fluctuations. We demonstrate that the effects of the fluctuations are not
reduced when a global correction to jet variables is applied. The above leads
to fundamental limitations in the ability to extract intrinsic information from
jets in the superboosted regime. The neutral fraction of a jet is correlated
with its flavor. This leads to an interesting and possibly useful difference
between superboosted W/Z/h/t jets and their corresponding backgrounds. The QCD
jets that form the background to the signal superboosted jets might also be
qualitatively different in their substructure as their mass might lie at or
below the Sudakov mass peak. Finally, we introduce a set of zero-cone
longitudinal jet substructure variables and show that while they carry
information that might be useful in certain situations, they are not in general
sensitive to the jet substructure.

Two of these galaxies are confirmed to host extremely large super massive black

formation histories and their structural properties we find that all these
extreme outliers can be considered as relic galaxies from the early (z$\sim$2)

stellar populations (t$\gtrsim$10 Gyr). In order to explain the nature of such

of these \""uber-massive SMBHs are galaxies that have followed a different
evolutionary path than the two-phase growth channel assumed for massive
galaxies. Once the SMBH and the core of the galaxy are formed at z$\sim$2, the
galaxy skips the second phase, remaining structurally untouched and without
further mass and size increase. We show that if the outliers had followed the
normal evolutionary path by growing in size via merger activity, the expected
(mild) growth in mass would place them closer to the observed local relations.
Our results suggest that the SMBH growth epoch for the most massive galaxies

This analytical result affirms a recent nonlinear, but mainly numerical

  The main result is that the ghost is absent for a sufficiently large brane

is either ruled out phenomenologically or becomes unstable for nontrivial
cosmologies. We argue that super-critical brane backgrounds constitute the

includes test particle simulations that follow a quasi-stationary density
wave-like scenario with rigidly rotating spiral arms, and $N$-body simulations
that host a bar and transient, co-rotating spiral arms. From a location similar
to that of the Sun, we calculate the radial, tangential and line-of-sight
peculiar velocity fields of a patch of the disc and quantify the fluctuations
by computing the power spectrum from a two-dimensional Fourier transform. We
find that the peculiar velocity power spectrum of the simulation with a bar and
transient, co-rotating spiral arms fits very well to that of APOGEE red clump
star data, while the quasi-stationary density wave spiral model without a bar
does not. We determine that the power spectrum is sensitive to the number of
spiral arms, spiral arm pitch angle and position with respect to the spiral
arm. However, it is necessary to go beyond the line of sight velocity field in
order to distinguish fully between the various spiral models with this method.
We compute the power spectrum for different regions of the spiral discs, and
discuss the application of this analysis technique to external galaxies.

$\sigma$ in Planck units, plus the von Neumann entropy of its exterior. Given a
null congruence $N$ orthogonal to $\sigma$, the rate of change of
$S_\text{gen}$ per unit area defines a quantum expansion. We conjecture that
the quantum expansion cannot increase along $N$. This extends the notion of
universal focussing to cases where quantum matter may violate the null energy
condition. Integrating the conjecture yields a precise version of the
Strominger-Thompson Quantum Bousso Bound. Applied to locally parallel
light-rays, the conjecture implies a Quantum Null Energy Condition: a lower
bound on the stress tensor in terms of the second derivative of the von Neumann
entropy. We sketch a proof of this novel relation in quantum field theory.

of narrow-band (NB) selected, star-forming (SF) H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at $z
\sim 2.23$ taken from the High Redshift(Z) Emission Line Survey (HiZELS). We
find that HAEs have similar SED-derived properties and colors to $sBzK$
galaxies and probe a well-defined portion of the SF population at $z \sim 2$.
This is not true for Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs), which are strongly biased
towards blue, less massive galaxies (missing a significant percentage of the SF
population). Combining our H$\alpha$ observations with matched, existing
Ly$\alpha$ data we determine that the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{\rm
esc}$) is low (only $\sim$ 4.5\% of HAEs show Ly$\alpha$ emission) and
decreases with increasing dust attenuation, UV continuum slope, stellar mass,
and star formation rate (SFR). This suggests that Ly$\alpha$ preferentially
escapes from blue galaxies with low dust attenuation. However, a small
population of red and massive LAEs is also present in agreement with previous
works. This indicates that dust and Ly$\alpha$ are not mutually exclusive.
Using different and completely independent measures of the total SFR we show
that the H$\alpha$ emission is an excellent tracer of star formation at $z \sim
2$ with deviations typically lower than 0.3 dex for individual galaxies. We
find that the slope and zero-point of the HAE main-sequence (MS) at $z \sim 2$
strongly depend on the dust correction method used to recover SFR, although
they are consistent with previous works when similar assumptions are made.

shapes offer a new probe of primordial non-Gaussianity and inflationary physics
which is complementary to galaxy number counts. Specifically, intrinsic
alignment correlations are sensitive to an anisotropic squeezed limit
bispectrum of the primordial perturbations. Such a feature arises in solid
inflation, as well as more broadly in the presence of light higher spin fields
during inflation (as pointed out recently by Arkani-Hamed and Maldacena). We
present a derivation of the all-sky two-point correlations of intrinsic shapes
and number counts in the presence of non-Gaussianity with general angular
dependence, and show that a quadrupolar (spin-2) anisotropy leads to the analog
in galaxy shapes of the well-known scale-dependent bias induced in number
counts by isotropic (spin-0) non-Gaussianity. Moreover, in presence of non-zero
anisotropic non-Gaussianity, the quadrupole of galaxy shapes becomes sensitive
to far superhorizon modes. These effects come about because long-wavelength
modes induce a local anisotropy in the initial power spectrum, with which
galaxies will correlate. We forecast that future imaging surveys could provide
constraints on the amplitude of anisotropic non-Gaussianity that are comparable
to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). These are complementary as
they probe different physical scales. The constraints, however, depend on the
sensitivity of galaxy shapes to the initial conditions which we only roughly
estimate from observed tidal alignments.

has a transverse component with respect to the local easy-axis of the crystal

non-locality, generalising Mermin's argument on the GHZ state. Using strongly
complementary observables, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for
Mermin non-locality in abstract process theories. We show that the existence of
more phases than classical points (aka eigenstates) is not sufficient, and that
the key to Mermin non-locality lies in the presence of certain algebraically
non-trivial phases. This allows us to show that fRel, a favourite toy model for
categorical quantum mechanics, is Mermin local. We show Mermin non-locality to
be the key resource ensuring the device-independent security of the HBB CQ

unspoken assumption that the measurements involved in Mermin-type scenarios
should be complementary (like the pair X,Y), opening the doors to a much wider
class of potential experimental setups than currently employed. In short, we
give conditions for Mermin non-locality tests on any number of systems, where
each party has an arbitrary number of measurement choices, where each
measurement has an arbitrary number of outcomes and further, that works in any

inertial confinement fusion capsules, sonoluminescent bubbles and the
gravitational collapse of astrophysical gases. For oblate modes under a
homologous flow, a monatomic gas is governed by the Schwarzschild criterion for
buoyant stability. Under buoyantly unstable conditions, fluctuations experience
power-law growth in time, with a growth rate that depends upon mean flow
gradients and is independent of mode number. If the flow accelerates throughout
the implosion, oblate modes amplify by a factor (2C)^(|N0| ti)$, where C is the
convergence ratio of the implosion, N0 is the initial buoyancy frequency and ti
is the implosion time scale. If, instead, the implosion consists of a coasting
phase followed by stagnation, oblate modes amplify by a factor exp(pi |N0| ts),
where N0 is the buoyancy frequency at stagnation and ts is the stagnation time
scale. Even under stable conditions, vorticity fluctuations grow due to the
conservation of angular momentum as the gas is compressed. For non-monatomic
gases, this results in weak oscillatory growth under conditions that would
otherwise be buoyantly stable; this over-stability is consistent with the
conservation of wave action in the fluid frame. By evolving the complete set of
linear equations, it is demonstrated that oblate modes are the fastest-growing
modes and that high mode numbers are required to reach this limit (Legendre
mode l > 100 for spherical flows). Finally, comparisons are made with a
Lagrangian hydrodynamics code, and it is found that a numerical resolution of
~30 zones per wavelength is required to capture these solutions accurately.
This translates to an angular resolution of ~(12/l) degrees, or < 0.1 degree to
resolve the fastest-growing modes.

interaction energy between the induced dipole and fluctuating virtual field of
the incident light can reach a few tenths of an eV. Therefore, the classical
electromagnetism dominating the field becomes inadequate. We argue that quantum

has made it possible to probe the internal rotation profiles of these stars,
which brings new constraints on the transport of angular momentum in stars.
Mosser et al. (2012) have measured the rotation rates in the central regions of
intermediate-mass core helium burning stars (secondary clump stars). Our aim
was to exploit& the rotational splittings of mixed modes to estimate the amount
of radial differential rotation in the interior of secondary clump stars using
Kepler data, in order to place constraints on angular momentum transport in
intermediate-mass stars. We selected a subsample of Kepler secondary clump
stars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. By applying a
thorough statistical analysis, we showed that the splittings of both
gravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and p-dominated modes
(trapped in the envelope) can be measured. We then used these splittings to
estimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques and
by applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory (Goupil et al.
2013). We obtained evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six of
the seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating
$1.8\pm0.3$ to $3.2\pm1.0$ times faster than the envelope. The last target was
found to be consistent with a solid-body rotation. This demonstrates that an
efficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the main
sequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during the
short-lived subgiant phase, or once He-burning has started in the core. In
either case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transport
mechanisms that are at work.

motivation is to compare the results with a recent theory, which shows that the
fluctuations in a generic anti-ferromagnetic model for itinerant fermions map
to those in the universality class of the dissipative quantum-XY model. The
quantum-critical fluctuations in this model, in a range of parameters, are
given by the correlations of spatial and of temporal topological defects. The
theory predicts a $\chi''({\bf q}, E, T)$ (i) which is a separable function of
$({\bf q -Q})$ and of ($E$,$T$), (ii) at crticality, the energy dependent part
is $\propto \tanh (E/2T)$ below a cut-off energy, (iii) the correlation time
departs from its infinite value at criticality on the disordered side by an
essential singularity, and (iv) the correlation length depends logarithmically
on the correlation time, so that the dynamical critical exponent $z$ is
$\infty$ . The limited existing experimental results are found to be consistent
with the first two unusual predictions from which the linear dependence of the

Gaussian noise $\alpha = 1/(\sqrt{n/\pi} \log^2 n)$ and binary secret, using
$2^{28}$ samples, while the previous best result based on BKW claims a time
complexity of $2^{74}$ with $2^{60}$ samples for the same parameters. We then
introduce variants of BDD, GapSVP and UniqueSVP, where the target point is
required to lie in the fundamental parallelepiped, and show how the previous
algorithm is able to solve these variants in subexponential time. Moreover, we
also show how the previous algorithm can be used to solve the BinaryLWE problem
with n samples in subexponential time $2^{(\ln 2/2+o(1))n/\log \log n}$. This
analysis does not require any heuristic assumption, contrary to other algebraic
approaches; instead, it uses a variant of an idea by Lyubashevsky to generate
many samples from a small number of samples. This makes it possible to
asymptotically and heuristically break the NTRU cryptosystem in subexponential
time (without contradicting its security assumption). We are also able to solve
subset sum problems in subexponential time for density $o(1)$, which is of
independent interest: for such density, the previous best algorithm requires
exponential time. As a direct application, we can solve in subexponential time
the parameters of a cryptosystem based on this problem proposed at TCC 2010.

extra pair of merging images, which was previously thought to be an unrelated
galaxy in seeing limited data. Owing to the peculiar geometry, the lens acts as
a natural coronagraph on the broad-line region of the quasar so that only
narrow [O III] emission is found in the fold arc. We use the data to
reconstruct the source structure and deflector potential, including nearby
perturbers. We reconstruct the point-spread function (PSF) from the quasar
images themselves, since no additional point source is present in the field of
view. From gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics, we find the slope of the
total mass density profile to be $\gamma^{\prime}=-\log\rho/\log r
=1.93\pm0.09.$ We discuss the potential of SDSS J1206+4332 for measuring time
delay distance (and thus H$_0$ and other cosmological parameters), or as a
standard ruler, in combination with the time delay published by the COSMOGRAIL

However, in order to achieve competitive precision and accuracy, an independent

by treating them as conformal infinities of conformally compact manifolds. This
involves the Loewner--Nirenberg-type problem of finding on the interior a
metric that is both conformally compact and of constant scalar curvature. Our
first result is an asymptotic solution to all orders. This involves log terms.
We show that the coefficient of the first of these is a new hypersurface
conformal invariant which generalises to higher dimensions the important
Willmore invariant of embedded surfaces. We call this the obstruction density.
For even dimensional hypersurfaces it is a fundamental curvature invariant. We
make the latter notion precise and show that the obstruction density and the
trace-free second fundamental form are, in a suitable sense, the only such
invariants. We also show that this obstruction to smoothness is a scalar
density analog of the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor for Poincare-Einstein
metrics; in part this is achieved by exploiting Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand
machinery. The solution to the constant scalar curvature problem provides a
smooth hypersurface defining density determined canonically by the embedding up
to the order of the obstruction. We give two key applications: the construction
of conformal hypersurface invariants and the construction of conformal
differential operators. In particular we present an infinite family of
conformal powers of the Laplacian determined canonically by the conformal
embedding. In general these depend non-trivially on the embedding and, in
contrast to Graham-Jennes-Mason-Sparling operators intrinsic to even
dimensional hypersurfaces, exist to all orders. These extrinsic conformal
Laplacian powers determine an explicit holographic formula for the obstruction
density.

square of the curvature radius, $ l $, of the anti-de Sitter space. On
increasing $l$ beyond a critical value $l_{c}$, the equilibrium radius of the

for radial distortions that, using only Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the
overdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the power
spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators
to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise
of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different
number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and
hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. for the BOSS
survey requires about three minutes for $\ell=0,2,4$ power spectra for scales
up to $k=0.3~h/$Mpc and about fifteen additional minutes for $\ell=0,2,4$
bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to $k=0.2~h/$Mpc on a single
core. The speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible to
compute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogs
with realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improved
constrains of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.

the framework of nonrelativistic second-order perturbation theory. Due to its
experimental interest, calculations are performed for muonic hydrogen,

scattering by incident linear polarized photons and the polarization of the

interference effects can be safely neglected in muonic hydrogen and helium-3,
in the case of muonic deuterium there are resonances with close proximity,
where quantum interference effects can induce shifts up to a few percent of the
linewidth, assuming a pointlike detector. However, by taking into account the
geometry of the setup used by the CREMA collaboration, this effect is reduced
to less than 0.2% of the linewidth in all possible cases, which makes it
irrelevant at the present level of accuracy.

Particularly, it remains unclear how variations in the population size across
cities impact the health of the population. We analyze the deviations from
linearity of the scaling of several health-related quantities, such as the
incidence and mortality of diseases, external causes of death, wellbeing, and
health-care availability, in respect to the population size of cities in
Brazil, Sweden and the USA. We find that deaths by non-communicable diseases
tend to be relatively less common in larger cities, whereas the per-capita
incidence of infectious diseases is relatively larger for increasing population
size. Healthier life style and availability of medical support are
disproportionally higher in larger cities. The results are connected with the
optimization of human and physical resources, and with the non-linear effects
of social networks in larger populations. An urban advantage in terms of health
is not evident and using rates as indicators to compare cities with different

the redshift of the end of the epoch of reionization, ii) the cosmology, iii)
the supernovae feedback prescription, and iv) the efficiency of star formation.
We find that the shape of the low-mass end of the HI mass function is most
affected by the critical halo mass below which galaxy formation is suppressed
by photoionisation heating of the intergalactic medium. We model the redshift
dependence of this critical dark matter halo mass by requiring a match to the
low-mass end of the HI mass function. The best fitting critical dark matter
halo mass decreases as redshift increases in this model, corresponding to a
circular velocity of $\sim 50 \, {\rm km \,s}^{-1}$ at $z=0$, $\sim 30 \, {\rm
km\, s}^{-1}$ at $z \sim 1$ and $\sim 12 \, {\rm km \, s}^{-1}$ at $z=6$. We
find that an evolving critical halo mass is required to explain both the shape
and abundance of galaxies in the HI mass function below $M_{\rm HI} \sim 10^{8}
h^{-2} {\rm M_{\odot}}$. The model makes specific predictions for the
clustering strength of HI-selected galaxies with HI masses > $10^{6} h^{-2}
{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $> 10^{7} h^{-2} {\rm M_{\odot}}$ and for the relation
between the HI and stellar mass contents of galaxies which will be testable
with upcoming surveys with the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders. We
conclude that measurements of the HI mass function at $z \ge 0$ will lead to an
improvement in our understanding of the net effect of photoionisation feedback

to begin with. A mean-field picture suggests two Fermi seas, of composite
fermions made from electrons or holes in the lowest Landau level, which occupy
different areas away from half filling and thus appear to represent distinct
states. We show that in the microscopic theory of composite fermions, which
satisfies particle-hole symmetry in the lowest Landau level to an excellent
degree, the Fermi wave vectors at filling factors $\nu$ and $1-\nu$ are the
same, and are generally consistent with the experimental findings of Kamburov
{\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 113}, 196801 (2014)]. Our calculations
suggest that the area of the CF Fermi sea may slightly violate the Luttinger
area rule.

motivated by the fact that neutrino oscillation experiments depend critically
on an accurate models of neutrino interactions. These models have to predict
not only the signal and background populations that oscillation experiments see
at near and far detectors, but they must also predict how the neutrino's energy
which enters a nucleus gets transferred to energies of the particles that leave
the nucleus after the neutrino interacts. Over the past year there have been a
number of new results on many different neutrino (and antineutrino) interaction
channels using several different target nuclei. These results are often not in
agreement with predictions extraolated from charged lepton scattering
measurements, or even from predictions anchored to neutrino measurements on
deuterium. These new measurements are starting to give the community the
handles needed to improve the theoretical description of neutrino interactions,
which ultimately pave the way for precision oscillation measurements. This
report briefly summarizes recent results and points out where those results
differ from the predictions based on current models.

interactions with the environment. Over evolutionary timescales, these
constraints feed back onto smaller molecular subnetworks comprising the
organism. The evolution of biological networks is studied by considering a
network of a few nodes embedded in a larger context. Taking into account this
fact that any network under study is actually embedded in a larger context, we
define network architecture, not on the basis of physical interactions alone,
but rather as a specification of the manner in which constraints are placed
upon the states of its nodes. We show that such network architectures
possessing cycles in their topology, in contrast to those that do not, may be
subjected to unsatisfiable constraints. This may be a significant factor
leading to selection biased against those network architectures where such
inconsistent constraints are more likely to arise. We proceed to quantify the
likelihood of inconsistency arising as a function of network architecture
finding that, in the absence of sampling bias over the space of possible
constraints and for a given network size, networks with a larger number of
cycles are more likely to have unsatisfiable constraints placed upon them. Our
results identify a constraint that, at least in isolation, would contribute to
a bias in the evolutionary process toward more hierarchical-modular versus
completely connected network architectures. Together, these results highlight
the context-dependence of the functionality of biological networks.

concepts of growing the SOM and updating it have been studied, the whole issue
of using a self-organizing Adaptive Data Structure (ADS) to further enhance the
properties of the underlying SOM, has been unexplored. In an earlier work, we
impose an arbitrary, user-defined, tree-like topology onto the codebooks, which
consequently enforced a neighborhood phenomenon and the so-called tree-based
Bubble of Activity. In this paper, we consider how the underlying tree itself
can be rendered dynamic and adaptively transformed. To do this, we present
methods by which a SOM with an underlying Binary Search Tree (BST) structure
can be adaptively re-structured using Conditional Rotations (CONROT). These
rotations on the nodes of the tree are local, can be done in constant time, and
performed so as to decrease the Weighted Path Length (WPL) of the entire tree.
In doing this, we introduce the pioneering concept referred to as Neural
Promotion, where neurons gain prominence in the Neural Network (NN) as their
significance increases. We are not aware of any research which deals with the
issue of Neural Promotion. The advantages of such a scheme is that the user
need not be aware of any of the topological peculiarities of the stochastic
data distribution. Rather, the algorithm, referred to as the TTOSOM with
Conditional Rotations (TTOCONROT), converges in such a manner that the neurons
are ultimately placed in the input space so as to represent its stochastic
distribution, and additionally, the neighborhood properties of the neurons suit
the best BST that represents the data. These properties have been confirmed by
our experimental results on a variety of data sets.

is of great interest to accurately resolve the spike signal from as few samples

this problem is terribly ill-posed. This paper proposes a convex optimization
framework to simultaneously estimate the point spread function as well as the

known low-dimensional subspace. By applying the lifting trick, we obtain an
underdetermined linear system of an ensemble of signals with joint spectral
sparsity, to which atomic norm minimization is applied. Under mild randomness
assumptions of the low-dimensional subspace as well as a separation condition
of the spike signal, we prove the proposed algorithm, dubbed as AtomicLift, is

attachment to particles below the outer surface. For small values of $a$, a
crossover from uncorrelated deposition (UD) to correlated growth is observed.
Simulations are performed in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions. Extrapolation of effective

roughening of the outer surface for $a>0$. A scaling approach for small $a$
predicts crossover times as $a^{-2/3}$ and local height fluctuations as
$a^{-1/3}$ at the crossover, independently of substrate dimension. These
relations are different from all previously studied models with crossovers from
UD to correlated growth due to subsurface aggregation, which reduces scaling
exponents. The same approach predicts the porosity and average pore height
scaling as $a^{1/3}$ and $a^{-1/3}$, respectively, in good agreement with

relations of simulated galaxies in the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium
Interaction Calculation suite of cosmological simulations. We make comparisons
to observations of the correlation of gas-phase abundances with M* (the
mass-metallicity relation, MZR), as well as with both M* and SFR or gas mass
fraction (the so-called 3D fundamental metallicity relations, FMRs). The
simulated galaxies follow the observed local MZR and FMRs over an order of
magnitude in M*, but overpredict the metallicity of massive galaxies (log M* >
10.5), plausibly due to inefficient feedback in this regime. We discuss the
origin of the MZR and FMRs in the context of galactic outflows and gas
accretion. We examine the evolution of mass-metallicity relations defined using
different elements that probe the three enrichment channels (SNII, SNIa, and
AGB stars). Relations based on elements produced mainly by SNII evolve weakly,
whereas those based on elements produced preferentially in SNIa/AGB exhibit
stronger evolution, due to the longer timescales associated with these
channels. Finally, we compare the relations of central and satellite galaxies,
finding systematically higher metallicities for satellites, as observed. We
show this is due to the removal of the metal poor gas reservoir that normally
surrounds galaxies and acts to dilute their gas-phase metallicity (via
cooling/accretion onto the disk), but is lost due to ram pressure stripping for
satellites.

at every position of a Sturmian word starts an abelian power of exponent $k$

of abelian powers and abelian repetitions (an abelian repetition is an analogue
of a fractional power) in Sturmian words. We give a formula for computing the
maximum exponent of an abelian power of abelian period $m$ starting at a given
position in any Sturmian word of rotation angle $\alpha$. vAs an analogue of
the critical exponent, we introduce the abelian critical exponent $A(s_\alpha)$

that $A(s_\alpha)$ equals the Lagrange constant of the number $\alpha$. This
yields a formula for computing $A(s_\alpha)$ in terms of the partial quotients

that $A(s_\alpha) \geq \sqrt{5}$ and that the equality holds for the Fibonacci

  Communication",,,"10.1109/TNET.2016.2587579",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the presence of buffers in the inner network nodes, each congestion
event leads to buffer queueing and thus to an increasing end-to-end delay. In
the case of delay sensitive applications, a large delay might not be acceptable
and a solution to properly manage congestion events while maintaining a low
end-to-end delay is required. Delay-based congestion algorithms are a viable
solution as they target to limit the experienced end-to-end delay.
Unfortunately, they do not perform well when sharing the bandwidth with
congestion control algorithms not regulated by delay constraints (e.g.,
loss-based algorithms). Our target is to fill this gap, proposing a novel
congestion control algorithm for delay-constrained communication over best
effort packet switched networks. The proposed algorithm is able to maintain a
bounded queueing delay when competing with other delay-based flows, and avoid
starvation when competing with loss-based flows. We adopt the well-known
price-based distributed mechanism as congestion control, but: 1) we introduce a
novel non-linear mapping between the experienced delay and the price function
and 2) we combine both delay and loss information into a single price term
based on packet interarrival measurements. We then provide a stability analysis
for our novel algorithm and we show its performance in the simulation results
carried out in the NS3 framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm is able to: achieve good intra-protocol fairness properties,
control efficiently the end-to-end delay, and finally, protect the flow from
starvation when other flows cause the queuing delay to grow excessively.

  Applications, pp.NA",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The class of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces,
first introduced by Chern and Tenenblat [3], is characterized by the property
that to each solution of a differential equation, within the class, there
corresponds a 2-dimensional Riemannian metric of curvature equal to $-1$. The
class of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces carries
close ties to the property of complete integrability, as manifested by the
existence of infinite hierarchies of conservation laws and associated linear
problems. As such, it contains many important known examples of integrable
equations, like the sine-Gordon, Liouville and KdV equations. It also gives
rise to many new families of integrable equations. The question we address in
this paper concerns the local isometric immersion of pseudo-spherical surfaces
in ${\bf E}^{3}$ from the perspective of the differential equations that give
rise to the metrics. Indeed, a classical theorem in the differential geometry
of surfaces states that any pseudo-spherical surface can be locally
isometrically immersed in ${\bf E}^{3}$. In the case of the sine-Gordon
equation, one can derive an expression for the second fundamental form of the
immersion that depends only on a jet of finite order of the solution of the
pde. A natural question is to know if this remarkable property extends to
equations other than the sine-Gordon equation within the class of differential
equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces. In an earlier paper [11], we
have shown that this property fails to hold for all other second order
equations, except for those belonging to a very special class of evolution
equations. In the present paper, we consider a class of evolution equations for
$u(x,t)$ of order $k\geq 3$ describing pseudo-spherical surfaces. We show that
whenever an isometric immersion in ${\bf E}^3$ exists, depending on a jet of
finite order of $u$, then the coefficients of the second fundamental forms are
functions of the independent variables $x$ and $t$ only.

properties of 300 galaxies in the nearby universe, observed with integral field
spectroscopy in the CALIFA survey. The sample covers a wide range of Hubble
types, from spheroidal to spiral galaxies, ranging in stellar masses from
$M_\star \sim 10^9$ to $7 \times 10^{11}$ $M_\odot$. We derive the stellar mass
surface density ($\mu_\star$), light-weighted and mass-weighted ages ($\langle
{\rm log}\,age\rangle _L$, $\langle {\rm log}\,age\rangle _M$), and
mass-weighted metallicity ($\langle {\rm log}\,Z_\star\rangle _M$), applying
the spectral synthesis technique. We study the mean trends with galaxy stellar
mass, $M_\star$, and morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc and Sd). We confirm
that more massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and less
reddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved
spatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these
relations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact,
older, and more metal rich for a given M$_\star$, which evidences that
quenching is related to morphology, but not driven by mass.

and the centrifugal deformation of the portion of the Earth's mass contained in
circulating fluids. The wobble may thus run like a heat engine, extracting
energy from heat-powered geophysical circulations whose natural periods would
otherwise be unrelated to the wobble's observed period of about fourteen
months. This can explain, more plausibly than previous models based on
stochastic perturbations or forced resonance, how the wobble is maintained
against viscous dissipation. The self-oscillation is a deterministic process,
but stochastic variations in the magnitude and distribution of the circulations
may turn off the positive feedback (a Hopf bifurcation), accounting for the
occasional extinctions, followed by random phase jumps, seen in the data. This
model may have implications for broader questions about the relation between
stochastic and deterministic dynamics in complex systems, and the statistical
analysis thereof.

provide a general result for the superfluid weight $D_{\rm s}$ of a multiband

nonzero Chern number $C$. We find that the integral over the Brillouin zone of
the quantum metric, an invariant calculated from the Bloch functions, gives the
superfluid weight in a flat band, with the bound $D_{\rm s} \geq |C|$. Thus,
even a flat band can carry finite superfluid current, provided the Chern number

invariant attractive Harper-Hubbard model that can be experimentally tested in
ultracold gases. In general, our results establish that a topologically

studied in a model of entropy deposition in the longitudinal direction
involving fluctuations of the longitudinal source profile on large scales. The
radiation from a single wounded nucleon is asymmetric in space-time rapidity.
It is assumed that the extent in rapidity of the region of deposited entropy is
random. Fluctuations in the deposition of entropy from each source increase the
event-plane decorrelation: for Pb-Pb collisions they improve the description of
the data, while for p-Pb collisions the mechanism is absolutely essential to
generate any sizable decorrelation. We also show that the experimental data for
rank-four flow may be explained via folding of the elliptic flow. The results

experiments is to assign treatments in fixed proportions within groups of
similar units: blocking. Previous results indicate that one can expect
substantial reductions in variance if these groups are formed so to contain
exactly as many units as treatment conditions. This approach can be contrasted
to threshold blocking which, instead of specifying a fixed size, requires that
the groups contain a minimum number of units. In this paper, I investigate the
advantages of respective method. In particular, I show that threshold blocking
is superior to fixed-sized blocking in the sense that it always finds a weakly
better grouping for any objective and sample. However, this does not
necessarily hold when the objective function of the blocking problem is
unknown, and a fixed-sized design can perform better in that case. I
specifically examine the factors that govern how the methods perform in the
common situation where the objective is to reduce the estimator's variance, but
where groups are constructed based on covariates. This reveals that the
relative performance of threshold blocking improves when the covariates become
more predictive of the outcome.

provides a high-resolution reconstruction of nerve fibres in human post-mortem
brains. The orientations of the fibres are derived from birefringence
measurements of histological brain sections assuming that the nerve fibres -
consisting of an axon and a surrounding myelin sheath - are uniaxial
birefringent and that the measured optic axis is oriented in direction of the
nerve fibres (macroscopic model). Although experimental studies support this
assumption, the molecular structure of the myelin sheath suggests that the
birefringence of a nerve fibre can be described more precisely by multiple
optic axes oriented radially around the fibre axis (microscopic model). In this
paper, we compare the use of the macroscopic and the microscopic model for
simulating 3D-PLI by means of the Jones matrix formalism. The simulations show
that the macroscopic model ensures a reliable estimation of the fibre
orientations as long as the polarimeter does not resolve structures smaller
than the diameter of single fibres. In the case of fibre bundles, polarimeters
with even higher resolutions can be used without losing reliability. When
taking the myelin density into account, the derived fibre orientations are
considerably improved.

the initial time $\tau_0$. A phenomenological study of the experimental data
for $R_{AA}(p_{T})$ is performed to constrain the two parameters with
simultaneous $\chi^2/{\rm d.o.f}$ fits to RHIC as well as LHC data. We obtain
for energetic quarks $\hat q_{0}\approx 1.1 \pm 0.2$ GeV$^2$/fm and

multiple scattering picture for the energetic jets propagating through the bulk

constraints for $\lambda_{0}$ and $\tau_0$, the estimated value for the
mean-squared transverse momentum broadening is moderate which implies that the
hard jets go through the medium with small reflection.

coefficient 1/4 and 1/2 respectively. Recent papers have presented
constructions which increase the coefficient of the lower bound to be at or
just below 3/8, but only for sparse sets of degree d related to primes of
specific congruence classes. By applying results from number theory these
constructions can be extended to be valid for every degree above some
threshold, establishing an improved asymptotic lower bound approaching 3/8. The
constructions use the direct product of the multiplicative and additive
subgroups of a Galois field and a specific coprime cyclic group. By
generalising this method an improved upper bound, with quadratic coefficient
3/8, is established for this class of construction of Abelian Cayley and
circulant graphs. Analysis of the order of the known extremal diameter 2
circulant graphs, up to degree 23, is shown to provide tentative support for a
quadratic coefficient of 3/8 for the asymptotic upper bound for the order of

surveillance of every area is not affordable. To cope with this issue, a common
countermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect
suspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve
the effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly
affected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain
alarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is
uncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is
common when the area to be secured is wide such as in border patrolling and
fair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first
Patrolling Security Game model where a Defender is supported by a spatially
uncertain alarm system which non-deterministically generates signals once a
target is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy in arbitrary
graphs is APX-hard even in zero-sum games and we provide two (exponential time)
exact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms.
Furthermore, we analyse what happens in environments with special topologies,
showing that in linear and cycle graphs the optimal patrolling strategy can be
found in polynomial time, de facto allowing our algorithms to be used in
real-life scenarios, while in trees the problem is NP-hard. Finally, we show
that without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling
strategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at
best. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates,
which, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system. We evaluate our
methods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

agreement with values from the literature. The AGB stars exhibit a range of
ages. A comparison with theoretical isochrones suggests that four luminous
O-rich Miras are as young as $2\times 10^8$ yrs. One of these has a lithium
absorption line in its spectrum, demonstrating that it is undergoing hot bottom
burning (HBB). This supports the idea that HBB is the cause of the high
luminosity of these AGB stars, which puts them above the fundamental
period-luminosity (PL) relation. Further studies of similar stars, selected
from their positions in the PL diagram, could provide insight into HBB. A much
fainter, presumed O-rich, Mira is similar to those found in Galactic globular
clusters. The C Miras are of intermediate age.

Among various 2D-carrier systems, such as field effect transistors and
heterostructures, polar materials hold a unique potential; the spontaneous
electric polarization in the bulk could generate positive and negative 2D
carriers at the surface. Although several experiments have shown ambipolar
carriers at the surface of a polar semiconductor BiTeI, their origin is yet to
be specified. Here we provide compelling experimental evidences that the
ambipolar 2D carriers at the surface of BiTeI are induced by the spontaneous
electric polarization. By imaging electron standing waves with spectroscopic
imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we find that positive or negative
carriers with Rashba-type spin splitting emerge at the surface correspondingly
to the polar directions in the bulk. The electron densities at the surface are
constant independently of those in the bulk, corroborating that the 2D carriers
are induced by the spontaneous electric polarization. We also successfully
image that lateral $p$-$n$ junctions are formed along the boundaries of
submicron-scale domains with opposite polar directions. Our study presents a
novel means to endow non-volatile, spin-polarized, and ambipolar 2D carriers as
well as, without elaborate fabrication, lateral $p$-$n$ junctions of those
carriers at atomically-sharp interfaces.

performed within the Local Pair (LP) model based on the assumption of the LP
formation in cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors (cuprates) below the pseudogap
(PG) temperature $T^*\gg T_c$. Similarly to the cuprates, near $T_c$
$\sigma'(T)$ is adequately described by the 3D term of the Aslamasov-Larkin
(AL) theory but the range of the 3D-AL fluctuations, $\Delta T_{3D}$, is
relatively short. Above the crossover temperature $T_0 \approx 11.7\,K$
$\sigma'(T)$ is described by the 2D Maki-Thompson (MT) fluctuation term of the
Hikami-Larkin (HL) theory. But enhanced 2D-MT fluctuation contribution, being
typical for the magnetic superconductors, is observed. Within the LP model
approach the PG parameter, $\Delta^*(T)$, was determined for the first time.
$\Delta^*(T)$ shows the narrow maximum at $T_s \approx 160\,K$ followed by the
linear drop down to $T_{SDW}=T_{NFe}\approx 133\,K$. Both small $\Delta T_{3D}$
and enhanced $\sigma'(T)$, including linear $\Delta^*(T)$ drop, are considered
to be the evidence of the enhanced magnetic interaction in
$EuFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15}$. Importantly, the slop of the linear $\Delta^*(T)$ and
its length are found to be the same as observed for $SmFeAsO_{0.85}$. The

different Fe-pnictides and applicability of the LP model approach to the

treat the incompressibility in the Navier-Stokes equations. The hyperbolic part
of the system is approximated using a kinetic finite volume solver and the
correction step implies to solve a mixed problem where the velocity and the
pressure are defined in compatible finite element spaces. The resolution of the
incompressibility constraint leads to an elliptic problem involving the
non-hydrostatic part of the pressure. This step uses a variational formulation
of a shallow water version of the incompressibility condition. Several
numerical experiments are performed to confirm the relevance of our approach.

radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts >=2. This work explores
the far-infrared emission of IFRS, providing crucial information on the star
forming and AGN activity of IFRS and on the potential link between IFRS and
high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs). A sample of six IFRS was observed with
the Herschel Space Observatory between 100 um and 500 um. Using these results,
we constrained the nature of IFRS by modelling their broad-band spectral energy
distribution (SED). Furthermore, we set an upper limit on their infrared SED
and decomposed their emission into contributions from an AGN and from star
forming activity. All six observed IFRS were undetected in all five Herschel
far-infrared channels (stacking limits: sigma = 0.74 mJy at 100 um, sigma =
3.45 mJy at 500 um). Based on our SED modelling, we find that the IFRS analysed
in this work can only be explained by objects that fulfil the selection
criteria of HzRGs. More precisely, IFRS could be (a) known HzRGs at very high
redshifts (z >= 10.5), (b) low-luminosity siblings of HzRGs with additional
dust obscuration at lower redshifts, (c) scaled or unscaled versions of Cygnus
A at any redshift, and (d) scaled and dust-obscured radio-loud quasars or
compact steep spectrum sources. We estimated upper limits on the infrared
luminosity, the black hole accretion rate, and the star formation rate of IFRS,
which all agreed with corresponding numbers of HzRGs.

protocols, quantum key distribution was first designed for qubits, the

bimatrix games it is no longer required that the sum of the players' utilities
to be zero or constant, thus, can be used to model a much larger class of
jamming problems. Additionally, in contrast to the standard bimatrix games, in
constrained bimatrix games the players' strategies must satisfy some linear
constraint/inequality, consequently, not all strategies are feasible and the
existence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) is not guaranteed anymore. We provide
the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the existence of the Nash
equilibrium is guaranteed, and show that the equilibrium pairs and the Nash
equilibrium solution of the constrained game corresponds to the global maximum
of a quadratic program. Finally, we use our game theoretic framework to find
the optimal transmission and jamming strategies for a typical wireless link
under power limited jamming.

efficient current-controlled spintronic devices. Much work has focused on the
role of spin-orbit coupling at heavy metal/ferromagnet interfaces in generating
current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, the strong influence of the
spin-orbit-derived Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on spin textures in
these materials is now becoming apparent. Recent reports suggest DMI-stabilized
homochiral domain walls (DWs) can be driven with high efficiency by spin torque
from the spin Hall effect. However, the influence of the DMI on the
current-induced magnetization switching has not been explored nor is yet
well-understood, due in part to the difficulty of disentangling spin torques
and spin textures in nano-sized confined samples. Here we study the
magnetization reversal of perpendicular magnetized ultrathin dots, and show
that the switching mechanism is strongly influenced by the DMI, which promotes
a universal chiral non-uniform reversal, even for small samples at the
nanoscale. We show that ultrafast current-induced and field-induced
magnetization switching consists on local magnetization reversal with domain
wall nucleation followed by its propagation along the sample. These findings,
not seen in conventional materials, provide essential insights for
understanding and exploiting chiral magnetism for emerging spintronics
applications.

For such a prior distribution, the Bayesian D-optimality criterion fails to
select a design. For the exponential decay model, we characterize singularity
of the prior distribution in terms of the expectations of a few elementary
transformations of the parameter. For a compartmental model and several
multi-parameter generalized linear models, we establish sufficient conditions
for singularity of a prior distribution. For the generalized linear models we
also obtain sufficient conditions for non-singularity. In the existing
literature, weakly informative prior distributions are commonly recommended as
a default choice for inference in logistic regression. Here it is shown that
some of the recommended prior distributions are singular, and hence should not
be used for Bayesian D-optimal design. Additionally, methods are developed to
derive and assess Bayesian D-efficient designs when numerical evaluation of the
objective function fails due to ill-conditioning, as often occurs for
heavy-tailed prior distributions. These numerical methods are illustrated for
logistic regression.

describe neat approaches for achieving scale and rotation invariance with

different spins in the cluster, XY-anisotropy in the exchange interaction and
the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term in the direction different for
the direction of the magnetic field. As a result, a zero-temperature

of the spin cluster the corresponding magnetic moment can be an explicit
function of the external magnetic field yielding the non-constant (non-plateau)
form of the magnetization curve within the given eigenstate. Also, the
XY-anisotropy makes the saturated magnetization (the eigenstate when all spins
in cluster are aligned along the magnetic field) inaccessible for finite
magnetic field magnitude (asymptotical saturation). We demonstrate all these
features on three examples: spin-1/2 dimer, mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimer, spin-1/2

much variety as possible, in the sense of maximizing the distinctiveness of
each subsystem.
  The quantum state of a microscopic system is defined to correspond to an
ensemble of subsystems of the universe with identical constituents and similar
preparations and environments. A new kind of interaction is posited amongst
such similar subsystems which acts to increase their distinctiveness, by
extremizing the variety. In the limit of large numbers of similar subsystems
this interaction is shown to give rise to Bohm's quantum potential. As a result
the probability distribution for the ensemble is governed by the Schroedinger
equation.
  The measurement problem is naturally and simply solved. Microscopic systems
appear statistical because they are members of large ensembles of similar
systems which interact non-locally. Macroscopic systems are unique, and are not
members of any ensembles of similar systems. Consequently their collective
coordinates may evolve deterministically.
  This proposal could be tested by constructing quantum devices from entangled
states of a modest number of quits which, by its combinatorial complexity, can
be expected to have no natural copies.

even high, temperatures -- the so-called `hot entanglement' -- has obvious
practical interest, but also requires closer theoretical scrutiny. Since
quantum entanglement in a system evolves in time and is continuously subjected
to environmental degradation, a nonequilibrium description by way of open
quantum systems is called for. To identify the key issues and the contributing
factors that may permit `hot entanglement' to exist, or the lack thereof, we
carry out a model study of two spatially-separated, coupled oscillators in a
shared bath depicted by a finite-temperature scalar field. From the Langevin
equations we derived for the normal modes and the entanglement measure
constructed from the covariance matrix we examine the interplay between direct
coupling, field-induced interaction and finite separation on the structure of
late-time entanglement. We show that the coupling between oscillators plays a
crucial role in sustaining entanglement at intermediate temperatures and over
finite separations. In contrast, the field-induced interaction between the
oscillators which is a non-Markovian effect, becomes very ineffective at high
temperature. We determine the critical temperature above which entanglement
disappears to be bounded in the leading order by the inverse frequency of the
center-of-mass mode of the reduced oscillator system, a result not unexpected,
which rules out hot entanglement in such settings.

prediction of the self-organized criticality (SOC) system with the spatial

effect, which results in spin-selective renormalization of effective masses. We
also discuss effects of interorbital exchange interactions, and reveal that
they induce novel crossover or reentrant behavior of the Kondo effect owing to
control of the coupling anisotropy. The laser-induced Kondo effect is highly
controllable by tuning the laser strength and the frequency, and thus offers a
versatile platform to study the Kondo physics using ultracold atoms.

$v_{\rm{mic}}$, $v_{\rm{rad}}$, $v \sin \,(i)$, and $A(\rm{Li})$) for a large

However, the physical mechanism of glitch is still a matter of debate because
it depends on the puzzle of pulsar's inner structure, i.e., the equation of
state of dense matter. Some pulsars (e.g., Vela-like) show large glitches
({\Delta}{\nu}/{\nu}~10^-6) but release negligible energy, whereas the large
glitches of AXPs/SGRs (anomalous X-ray pulsars/soft gamma repeaters) are
usually (but not always) accompanied with detectable energy releases
manifesting as X-ray bursts or outbursts. We try to understand this aspect of
glitches in a starquake model of solid quark stars. There are actually two
kinds of glitches in this scenario: bulk-invariable (Type I) and bulk-variable
(Type II) ones. The total stellar volume changes (and then energy releases)
significantly for the latter but not for the former. Therefore, glitches
accompanied with X-ray bursts (e.g., that of AXP/SGRs) could originate from
Type II starquakes induced probably by accretion, while the others without
evident energy release (e.g., that of Vela pulsar) would be the result of Type
I starquakes due to, simply, a change of stellar ellipticity.

range of 1 to 100 nm. It provides good statistics for large numbers of
structural units for short measurement times. With the ever-increasing quantity
and quality of data acquisition, the value of appropriate tools that are able
to extract valuable information is steadily increasing. SASfit has been one of
the mature programs for small-angle scattering data analysis available for many
years. We describe the basic data processing and analysis work-flow along with
recent developments in the SASfit program package (version 0.94.6). They
include (i) advanced algorithms for reduction of oversampled data sets (ii)
improved confidence assessment in the optimized model parameters and (iii) a
flexible plug-in system for custom user-provided models. A scattering function
of a mass fractal model of branched polymers in solution is provided as an
example for implementing a plug-in. The new SASfit release is available for
major platforms such as Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. To facilitate
documentation, it includes improved indexed user documentation as well as a
web-based wiki for peer collaboration and online videos for introduction of
basic usage. The usage of SASfit is illustrated by interpretation of the
small-angle X-ray scattering curves of monomodal gold nanoparticles (NIST
reference material 8011) and bimodal silica nanoparticles (EU reference
material ERM-FD-102).

variations in absorption line profiles can be detected reliably from high

small-scale structure within the intervening gas or intrinsic origin. The
targets selected allow us to investigate the time behavior of a broad variety
of absorption line systems, sampling diverse environments: the vicinity of
active nuclei, galaxy halos, molecular-rich galaxy disks associated with damped
Lya systems, as well as neutral gas within our own Galaxy. Results. Absorption
lines from MgII, FeII or proxy species with lines of lower opacity tracing the
same kind of gas appear to be remarkably stable (1 sigma upper limits as low as
10 % for some components on scales in the range 10 - 100 au), even for systems
at z_abs ~ z_e. Marginal variations are observed for MgII lines toward PKS
1229-021 at z_abs = 0.83032; however, we detect no systems displaying changes
as large as those reported in low resolution SDSS spectra. In neutral or
diffuse molecular media, clear changes are seen for Galactic NaI lines toward
PKS 1229-02 (decrease of N by a factor of four for one of the five components

at the 10 au-scale for this warm gas. A marginal change is also seen in CI from
another velocity component (~70% variation in N(CI)).

These themes all tie together as a set of practical skills in scientific
measurement, analysis, and experimentation. In addition to teaching students
how to use these skills, it is important for students to know when to use them
so that they can use them autonomously. This requires, especially in the case
of analytical skills, high-levels of inquiry behaviours to reflect on data and
iterate measurements, which students rarely do in lab experiments. In this
paper, we describe a simple framework for structuring the critical thinking and
inquiry behaviours relevant to lab work, which focuses on iterative cycles of
comparisons between data sets. We describe the framework and demonstrate
examples of its use in an introductory physics lab course.

to describe the soliton contains a one-body term, derived from the solution of
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and a two-body Jastrow term which accounts for
the repulsive correlations between atoms. We optimize the parameters in the
many-body wave function via a Variational Monte Carlo procedure, calculating
the grand-canonical energy and the canonical momentum of the system in a moving
reference frame where the soliton is stationary. As the density of the gas is
increased, significant deviations from the mean-field predictions are found for
the excitation energy and the density profile of both dark and grey solitons.
In particular, the soliton effective mass $m^\ast$ and the mass $m\Delta N$ of
missing particles in the region of the density depression are smaller than the
result from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, their ratio being however well
reproduced by this theory up to large values of the gas parameter. We also

functions obtained by dynamic light scattering experiments for Laponite
suspensions with different concentrations ($C_{L}$), added salt concentrations
($C_{S}$) and temperatures ($T$). It has been shown in an earlier work [Soft
Matter, 10, 3292-3300 (2014)] that the evolutions of relaxation timescales of
colloidal glasses can be compared with molecular glass formers by mapping the
waiting time ($t_{w}$) of the former with the inverse of thermodynamic
temperature ($1/T$) of the latter. In this work, the fragility parameter $D$,
which signifies the deviation from Arrhenius behavior, is obtained from fits to
the time evolutions of the structural relaxation timescales. For the Laponite
suspensions studied in this work, $D$ is seen to be independent of $C_{L}$ and
$C_{S}$, but is weakly dependent on $T$. Interestingly, the behavior of $D$
corroborates the behavior of fragility in molecular glass formers with respect
to equivalent variables. Furthermore, the stretching exponent $\beta$, which
quantifies the width $w$ of the spectrum of structural relaxation timescales is
seen to depend on $t_{w}$. A hypothetical Kauzmann time $t_{k}$, analogous to
the Kauzmann temperature for molecular glasses, is defined as the timescale at
which $w$ diverges. Corresponding to the Vogel temperature defined for
molecular glasses, a hypothetical Vogel time $t^{\infty}_{\alpha}$ is also
defined as the time at which the structural relaxation time diverges.
Interestingly, a correlation is observed between $t_{k}$ and
$t^{\infty}_{\alpha}$, which is remarkably similar to that known for fragile
molecular glass formers. A coupling model that accounts for the
$t_{w}$-dependence of the stretching exponent is used to analyse and explain
the observed correlation between $t_{k}$ and $t^{\infty}_{\alpha}$.

such as powerful workstations. However, the data structure of the original
implementation, based on trees of pointers, provides limited opportunities for
efficiency enhancements, while posing serious challenges in terms of parallel
programming and load balancing. The present contribution proposes a new
implementation of the whole set of numerical methods including Radau5 and
ROCK4, relying on a fully different data structure together with the use of a
specific library, TBB, for shared-memory, task-based parallelism with
work-stealing. The performance of our implementation is assessed in a series of
test-cases of increasing difficulty in two and three dimensions on multi-core
and many-core architectures, demonstrating high scalability.

energy and vacuum pressure of elementary fields versus non-elementary fields
(like e.g. phonon fields), is pointed out. An improved law for the canonical
quantization of fields is presented, which is based on the distinction between
elementary and non-elementary fields. Remarkably, the improved quantization
method removes not only the inconsistency of quantum field theory, but at the
same time solves the (old) cosmological constant problem for all fields of the
standard model of elementary particles (but not for the hypothetical inflaton
fields), without compromising any of the achievements of established quantum
field theory.

locations by measuring the phase of a sinusoidal signal transmitted between the
locations. This method is only capable of unambiguously measuring range within
an interval of length equal to the wavelength of the signal. To address this
problem signals of multiple different wavelengths can be transmitted. The range
can then be measured within an interval of length equal to the least common
multiple of these wavelengths. Estimation of the range requires solution of a
problem from computational number theory called the closest lattice point
problem. Algorithms to solve this problem require a basis for this lattice.
Constructing a basis is non-trivial and an explicit construction has only been
given in the case that the wavelengths can be scaled to pairwise relatively
prime integers. In this paper we present an explicit construction of a basis
without this assumption on the wavelengths. This is important because the
accuracy of the range estimator depends upon the wavelengths. Simulations
indicate that significant improvement in accuracy can be achieved by using
wavelengths that cannot be scaled to pairwise relatively prime integers.
