The Peruvian oxygen minimum zone is one of the most pronounced and lies in a
region of strong mesoscale activity in the form of vortices and frontal
regions, whose effect in the dynamics of the oxygen minimum zone is largely
unknown. Here, we study this issue from a modeling approach and a Lagrangian
point of view, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical simulation of the
Peruvian oxygen minimum zone and finite-size Lyapunov exponent fields to
understand the link between mesoscale dynamics and oxygen variations. Our
results show that, at depths between 380 and 600 meters, mesoscale structures
have a relevant dual role. First, their mean positions and paths delimit and
maintain the oxygen minimum zone boundaries. Second, their high frequency
fluctuations entrain oxygen across these boundaries as eddy fluxes that point
towards the interior of the oxygen minimum zone and are one order of magnitude
larger than mean fluxes. We conclude that these eddy fluxes contribute to the
ventilation of the oxygen minimum zone.

two such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces
the net interfacial free energy. In analogy with the hydrophobic effect, we
refer to this phenomenon as the ""orderphobic effect"". The effect is mediated by
proximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic

reduces the requirements for photonic quantum gates. The resulting gate can be

Hamamatsu (model R8520-06) powered by a Cockcroft-Walton generator. The
detector module containing the CaMoO4 crystal was placed in a 3He/4He dilution
refrigerator and used to measure scintillation characteristics of CaMoO4 in the
millikelvin temperature range. At the lowest temperature achieved, the energy
resolution of CaMoO4 for 122 keV from a 57Co source is found to be 30% (FWHM),

large-scale settings. The well-known Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm has been
shown to achieve Nash equilibrium learning in certain classes of multi-agent
games. However, FP can be computationally difficult to implement when the
number of players is large. Sampled FP is a variant of FP that mitigates the
computational difficulties arising in FP by using a Monte-Carlo (i.e.,
sampling-based) approach. The Sampled FP algorithm has been studied both as a
tool for distributed learning and as an optimization heuristic for large-scale
problems. Despite its computational advantages, a shortcoming of Sampled FP is
that the number of samples that must be drawn in each round of the algorithm
grows without bound (on the order of $\sqrt{t}$, where $t$ is the round of the
repeated play). In this paper we propose Computationally Efficient Sampled FP
(CESFP)---a variant of Sampled FP in which only one sample need be drawn each
round of the algorithm (a substantial reduction from $O(\sqrt{t})$ samples per
round, as required in Sampled FP). CESFP operates using a
stochastic-approximation type rule to estimate the expected utility from round
to round. It is proven that the CESFP algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium
learning in the same sense as classical FP and Sampled FP. Simulation results
suggest that the convergence rate of CESFP (in terms of repeated-play
iterations) is similar to that of Sampled FP.

fast and efficient approach for computing the frequencies of these subgraph

we propose a fast, efficient, and parallel algorithm for counting graphlets of

\sqrt{n}( F_n - F)$ and the rescaled empirical distribution function $\beta_n =
n (F_n(\tau+\frac{\cdot}{n})-F_n(\tau))$, where $F$ is an arbitrary cdf,
differentiable at some point $\tau$, and $F_n$ the corresponding empricial cdf.
This seems rather counterintuitive, since, for every $n \in N$, there is a
deterministic correspondence between $\alpha_n$ and $\beta_n$. Precisely, we
show that the pair $(\alpha_n,\beta_n)$ converges in law to a limit having
independent components, namely a time-transformed Brownian bridge and a
two-sided Poisson process. Since these processes have jumps, in particular if
$F$ itself has jumps, the Skorokhod product space $D(R) \times D(R)$ is the
adequate choice for modeling this convergence in. We develop a short
convergence theory for $D(R) \times D(R)$ by establishing the classical
principle, devised by Yu. V. Prokhorov, that finite-dimensional convergence and
tightness imply weak convergence. Several tightness criteria are given.
Finally, the convergence of the pair $(\alpha_n,\beta_n)$ implies convergence
of each of its components, thus, in passing, we provide a thorough proof of
these known convergence results in a very general setting. In fact, the

discovery in machine learning are highly relevant to problems in quantum
information, in particular quantum nonlocality. The crucial ingredient in the
connection between both fields is the tool of Bayesian networks, a graphical
model used to reason about probabilistic causation. Indeed, Bell's theorem
concerns a particular kind of a Bayesian network and Bell inequalities are a
special case of linear constraints following from such models. It is thus
natural to look for generalized Bell scenarios involving more complex Bayesian
networks. The problem, however, relies on the fact that such generalized
scenarios are characterized by polynomial Bell inequalities and no current
method is available to derive them beyond very simple cases. In this work, we
make a significant step in that direction, providing a general and practical
method for the derivation of polynomial Bell inequalities in a wide class of
scenarios, applying it to a few cases of interest. We also show how our
construction naturally gives rise to a notion of non-signalling in generalized
networks.

This paper attends to the problem of admitting and embedding a maximum number

routed via a sequence of to-be-allocated, capacitated network functions. We
consider an Online variant of this maximum Service Chain Embedding Problem,
short OSCEP, where requests arrive over time, in a worst-case manner. Our main
contribution is a deterministic O(log L)-competitive online algorithm, under
the assumption that capacities are at least logarithmic in L. We show that this
is asymptotically optimal within the class of deterministic and randomized

algorithms, and prove that the offline problem is APX-hard for unit capacities

also extend to other problems such as Virtual Circuit Routing. Finally, we
present an exact algorithm based on 0-1 programming, implying that the general

particular four dimensional fuzzy vacuum that may be expressed in terms of a
direct sum of product of two fuzzy spheres, and denote it in short as $S_F^{2\,
Int}\times S_F^{2\, Int}$. The direct sum structure of the vacuum is revealed
by a suitable splitting of the scalar fields in the model in a manner that
generalizes our approach in \cite{Seckinson}. Fluctuations around this vacuum
have the structure of gauge fields over $S_F^{2\, Int}\times S_F^{2\, Int}$,
and this enables us to conjecture the spontaneous broken model as an effective
$U(n)$ $(n < {\cal N})$ gauge theory on the product manifold $M^4 \times
S_F^{2\, Int} \times S_F^{2\, Int}$. We support this interpretation by
examining the $U(4)$ theory and determining all of the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$
equivariant fields in the model, characterizing its low energy degrees of
freedom. Monopole sectors with winding numbers $(\pm
1,0),\,(0,\pm1),\,(\pm1,\pm 1)$ are accessed from $S_F^{2\, Int}\times S_F^{2\,

sectors are obtained. We indicate how Abelian Higgs type models with vortex
solutions emerge after dimensionally reducing over the fuzzy monopole sectors
as well. A family of fuzzy vacua is determined by giving a systematic treatment
for the splitting of the scalar fields and it is made manifest that suitable
projections of these vacuum solutions yield all higher winding number fuzzy
monopole sectors. We observe that the vacuum configuration $S_F^{2\, Int}\times
S_F^{2\, Int}$ identifies with the bosonic part of the product of two fuzzy
superspheres with $OSP(2,2)\times OSP(2,2)$ supersymmetry and elaborate on this

complementarity. In the fuzzball paradigm, the black hole microstates have no
interior, and radiate unitarily from their surface through quanta of energy
$E\sim T$. But quanta with $E\gg T$ impinging on the fuzzball create large
collective excitations of the fuzzball surface. The dynamics of such
excitations must be studied as an evolution in superspace, the space of all
fuzzball solution $|F_i\rangle$. The states in this superspace are arranged in
a hierarchy of `complexity'. We argue that evolution towards higher complexity
maps, through a duality analogous to AdS/CFT, to infall inside the horizon of
the traditional hole. We explain how the large degeneracy of fuzzball states
leads to a breakdown of the principle of equivalence at the threshold of
horizon formation. We recall that the firewall argument did not invoke the
limit $E\gg T$ when considering a complementary picture; on the contrary it
focused on the dynamics of the $E\sim T$ modes which contribute to Hawking

magnetic fields, we study the ground state of bosons interacting with long
range dipolar interactions on a two-leg ladder. Using two complimentary
variational approaches, valid for weak interactions, we find rich physics
driven by the long range forces. Generically, long range interactions tend to
destroy the Meissner phase in favor of modulated density wave phases. Nearest
neighbor interactions produce a novel interleg charge density wave phase, where
the total density remains uniform, but the density on each leg of the ladder is
modulating in space, out-of-phase with one another. At weak magnetic fields,
next nearest neighbor interactions lead to a fully modulated biased ladder
phase, where all the particles are on one leg of the ladder, and the density is
modulating in space. This state simultaneously breaks $Z_{2}$ reflection
symmetry and $U(1)$ symmetry associated with translation in real space. For
values of the flux near $\phi = \pi$, we find that a switching effect occurs
for arbitrarily weak interactions, where the density modulates in space, but
the chiral current changes sign on every plaquette. Arbitrarily weak attractive
interactions along the rungs destroy the Meissner phase completely, in favor of
a modulated density wave phase. Varying magnetic field produces a cascade of
first order transitions between modulated density wave states with different
wave-vectors, which manifests itself as discrete jumps in the chiral current.
Polarizing the dipoles along the ladder direction yields a region of phase
space where a stable biased ladder phase occurs even at arbitrarily weak
magnetic fields. We discuss the experimental consequences of our work, in

\citet{HojLaur:2008} who also gave an algorithm to compute the maximum
likelihood estimate of the precision matrix for such models. In this paper, we
take a Bayesian approach to the estimation of the precision matrix. We consider
only those models where the symmetry constraints are imposed on the precision
matrix and which thus form a natural exponential family with the precision
matrix as the canonical parameter.
  We first identify the Diaconis-Ylvisaker conjugate prior for these models and
develop a scheme to sample from the prior and posterior distributions. We thus
obtain estimates of the posterior mean of the precision matrix.
  Second, in order to verify the precision of our estimate, we derive the
explicit analytic expression of the expected value of the precision matrix when
the graph underlying our model is a tree, a complete graph on three vertices
and a decomposable graph on four vertices with various symmetries. In those
cases, we compare our estimates with the exact value of the mean of the prior
distribution. We also verify the accuracy of our estimates of the posterior
mean on simulated data for graphs with up to thirty vertices and various
symmetries.

paintings are recognized as realizations of the creative process which, in
general, is shown to correspond to self-organization of texture features which
determine the aesthetic complexity of the painting. The method consists of the
wavelet based statistical digital image processing and the measure of
statistical complexity which represents the minimal (average) information
necessary for optimal prediction. The statistical complexity is based on the
properly defined causal states with optimal predictive properties. Two
different time concepts related to the works of art are introduced: the
internal time and the artistic time. The internal time of the artwork is
determined by the span of causal dependencies between wavelet coefficients
while the artistic time refers to the internal time during which complexity
increases where complexity refers to compositional, aesthetic and structural
arrangement of texture features. The method is illustrated by recognizing the
original paintings from the copies made by the artists themselves, including
the works of the famous surrealist painter Ren\'{e} Magritte.

extractive spoken document summarization, with the purpose of automatically

research and experimentation. On the other hand, word embedding has emerged as
a newly favorite research subject because of its excellent performance in many

the summarization process is to represent the document (or sentence) by
averaging the word embeddings of the words occurring in the document (or

focuses on building novel and efficient ranking models based on the general

artificial, generally intelligent system (AGI). It is argued that building a
general data compression algorithm solving all problems up to a complexity
threshold should be the main thrust of research. A measure for partial progress
in AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some
general properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its
inductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly
searching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining
the data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby
compressing the data increasingly at every iteration.
  Abstract Based on that fundamental ability, a grounded reasoning system is
proposed. It is argued how grounding and flexible feature bases made of
hypotheses allow for resourceful thinking. While the simulation of
representation contents on the mental stage accounts for much of the power of
propositional logic, compression leads to simple sets of hypotheses that allow
the detection and verification of universally quantified statements.
  Abstract Together, it is highlighted how general compression and grounded
reasoning could account for the birth and growth of first concepts about the
world and the commonsense reasoning about them.

than the critical one for the onset of Tollmien-Schlichting waves. The
transition to turbulence follows the same route as the by-pass transition in
boundary layers, i.e. finite amplitude perturbations are required and the flow
is dominated by downstream vortices and streaks in the transitional regime. In
order to relate the phenomenology in plane Poiseuille flow to our previous
studies of plane Couette flow (Kreilos & Eckhardt, 2012), we study a symmetric
subspace of plane Poiseuille flow in which the bifurcation cascade stands out
clearly. By tracing the edge state, which in this system is a travelling wave,
and its bifurcations, we can trace the formation of a chaotic attractor, the
interior crisis that increase the phase space volume affected by the flow, and
the ultimate transition into a chaotic saddle in a crisis bifurcation. After
the boundary crisis we can observe transient chaos with exponentially

characteristic large-scale disk structures resulting from the binary-disk

Subsequently, we performed radiative transfer simulations to obtain scattered

and the eccentricity of the binary orbit on observational quantities. We find
that ALMA will allow tracing asymmetries of the inner edge of the disk and
potentially resolving spiral arms if the disk is seen face-on. For an edge-on
orientation, ALMA will allow detecting perturbations in the disk density
distribution through asymmetries in the radial brightness profile. Through the
asymmetric structure of the disks, areas are formed with a temperature $2.6$
times higher than at the same location in equivalent unperturbed disks. The

the value of $a_E$ remarkably decreases when compared with the Kerr black hole,
the ergosphere becomes more thick with increase in $g$. We also study collision
of two equal mass particle near the horizon of this black hole, and explicitly

demonstrated that the $E_{CM}$ could be arbitrary high in the extremal cases

degenerate Kolmogorov operator L. A crucial point is that the evolution
operator L may have singular and nonsmooth coefficients. This allows the
application of the method e.g. to degenerate and singular particle systems
arising in Mathematical Physics. As far as we know in such singular cases the
relaxation to equilibrium can't be discussed with the help of existing
approaches using hypoellipticity, hypocoercivity or stochastic Lyapunov type
techniques. The method is formulated in an L2-Hilbert space setting and is
based on an interplay between Functional Analysis and Stochastics. Moreover, it
implies an ergodicity rate which can be related to L2-exponential convergence
of the semigroup. Furthermore, the ergodicity method shows up an interesting
analogy with existing hypocoercivity approaches. In the first application we
discuss ergodicity of the N-particle degenerate Langevin dynamics with singular
potentials. The dual to this equation is also called the kinetic Fokker-Planck
equation with an external confining potential. In the second example we apply
the method to the so-called (degenerate) spherical velocity Langevin equation

the underlying hardware and communications whereas many companies build on this
infrastructure to offer higher level, cloud-hosted PaaS services and/or SaaS
applications. From the start, strong isolation between cloud tenants was seen
to be of paramount importance, provided first by virtual machines (VM) and
later by containers, which share the operating system (OS) kernel. Increasingly
it is the case that applications also require facilities to effect isolation
and protection of data managed by those applications. They also require
flexible data sharing with other applications, often across the traditional
cloud-isolation boundaries; for example, when government provides many related
services for its citizens on a common platform. Similar considerations apply to
the end-users of applications. But in particular, the incorporation of cloud
services within `Internet of Things' architectures is driving the requirements
for both protection and cross-application data sharing.
  These concerns relate to the management of data. Traditional access control
is application and principal/role specific, applied at policy enforcement
points, after which there is no subsequent control over where data flows; a
crucial issue once data has left its owner's control by cloud-hosted
applications and within cloud-services. Information Flow Control (IFC), in
addition, offers system-wide, end-to-end, flow control based on the properties
of the data. We discuss the potential of cloud-deployed IFC for enforcing
owners' dataflow policy with regard to protection and sharing, as well as
safeguarding against malicious or buggy software. In addition, the audit log
associated with IFC provides transparency, giving configurable system-wide
visibility over data flows. [...]

the question whether multivalued quantum circuits are more efficient than the

to the optimization of generic multivalued quantum circuits. The multivalued
quantum Shannon decompositions (QSD) are improved so that the circuits obtained
are asymptotically optimal for all dimensionality d. The syntheses of uniformly
multifold controlled $R_y$ rotations are also optimized to make the circuits
further simplified. Moreover, the theoretical lower bound of complexity for
multivalued quantum circuits is investigated, and a quantity known as
efficiency index is proposed to evaluate the efficiency of synthesis of various
quantum circuits. The algorithm for qudit circuits given here is an efficient
synthesis routine which produces best known results for all dimensionality d,
and for both cases the number of qudit n is small and that is asymptotic. The
multivalued quantum circuits are indeed more efficient than the binary quantum
circuits. The facts, the leading factor of the lower bound of complexity for
qudit circuits is small by a factor of d-1 in comparison to that for qubit
circuits and the asymptotic efficiency index is increased with the increase of
dimensionality d, reveal the potential advantage of qudit circuits over generic
qubit circuits. The generic n-qudit circuits with $d\geq5$ and generic
two-ququart circuits synthesized by the algorithm given here are practical
circuits which are more efficient than the most efficient qubit circuits.

detect and resolve HI in eleven galaxies down to a column density of
$\sim10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ inside a ~6 deg$^2$ field and with a resolution of ~1
arcmin on the sky and ~8 km/s in velocity. We present HI images, velocity
fields and integrated spectra of all detections, and highlight the discovery of
three HI clouds -- two in the proximity of the galaxy IC 5270 and one close to
NGC 7418. Each cloud has an HI mass of $10^9$ M$_\odot$ and accounts for ~15%
of the HI associated with its host galaxy. Available images at ultraviolet,
optical and infrared wavelengths do not reveal any clear stellar counterpart of
any of the clouds, suggesting that they are not gas-rich dwarf neighbours of IC
5270 and NGC 7418. Using Parkes data we find evidence of additional extended,
low-column-density HI emission around IC 5270, indicating that the clouds are
the tip of the iceberg of a larger system of gas surrounding this galaxy. This
result adds to the body of evidence on the presence of intra-group gas within
the IC 1459 group. Altogether, the HI found outside galaxies in this group
amounts to several times $10^9$ M$_\odot$, at least 10% of the HI contained
inside galaxies. This suggests a substantial flow of gas in and out of galaxies
during the several billion years of the group's evolution.

maps from Planck and WMAP data shows consistency with a dipole modulation,

consistent with previous fits based on the temperature fluctuation power. The
signal is scale dependent, with a statistically significant amplitude at

of the ionosphere creates thermal winds which by dynamo action induce an
electric field driving an electric current having a magnetic effect observable
on the ground, as was discovered by G. Graham in 1722. The current rises and
sets with the Sun and thus causes a readily observable diurnal variation of the
geomagnetic field, allowing us the deduce the conductivity and thus the EUV
flux as far back as reliable magnetic data reach. High-quality data go back to
the 'Magnetic Crusade' of the 1830s and less reliable, but still usable, data
are available for portions of the hundred years before that. J.R. Wolf and,
independently, J.-A. Gautier discovered the dependence of the diurnal variation
on solar activity, and today we understand and can invert that relationship to
construct a reliable record of the EUV flux from the geomagnetic record. We
compare that to the F10.7 flux and the sunspot number, and find that the
reconstructed EUV flux reproduces the F10.7 flux with great accuracy. On the
other hand, it appears that the Relative Sunspot Number as currently defined is
beginning to no longer be a faithful representation of solar magnetic activity,
at least as measured by the EUV and related indices. The reconstruction
suggests that the EUV flux reaches the same low (but non-zero) value at every
sunspot minimum (possibly including Grand Minima), representing an invariant
'solar magnetic ground state'.

its decay in the $W^\pm h$ channel in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM) as well as several 2-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). $h$, the lightest
scalar Higgs boson in these models, is identified with the recently discovered
$\sim 125$ GeV state, $H_\text{obs}$, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We
find that, while it provides an important input in the kinematic selection of
signal events, the measured $H_\text{obs}$ mass renders this channel
inaccessible in the MSSM. In the 2HDMs though, through a dedicated
signal-to-background analysis for the $pp\to t(\bar{b})H^-\to \ell^\pm\nu_\ell
jj bb\bar{b}(\bar{b})$+h.c process, we establish that some parameter space
regions will be testable at the LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV.

the difficulty that we must assess probability distributions over possible
observations, prescribed not just by an underlying theory, but by a theory
together with a conditionalization scheme that allows for (anthropic) selection
effects. This means we usually need to compare distributions that are
consistent with a broad range of possible observations, with actual
experimental data. One controversial means of making this comparison is by
invoking the 'principle of mediocrity': that is, the principle that we are
typical of the reference class implicit in the conjunction of the theory and
the conditionalization scheme. In this paper, I quantitatively assess the
principle of mediocrity in a range of cosmological settings, employing
'xerographic distributions' to impose a variety of assumptions regarding
typicality. I find that for a fixed theory, the assumption that we are typical
gives rise to higher likelihoods for our observations. If, however, one allows
both the underlying theory and the assumption of typicality to vary, then the
assumption of typicality does not always provide the highest likelihoods.
Interpreted from a Bayesian perspective, these results support the claim that
when one has the freedom to consider different combinations of theories and
xerographic distributions (or different 'frameworks'), one should favor the
framework that has the highest posterior probability; and then from this
framework one can infer, in particular, how typical we are. In this way, the
invocation of the principle of mediocrity is more questionable than has been
recently claimed.

properties of the Fourier transform of measures or distributions supported on
thin sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. When the support is a smooth enough manifold, an
almost complete picture is available. One of the early results in this
direction is the following: Let $f\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $d\sigma$
be the surface measure on the sphere $S^{n-1}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. Then
  $$|\widehat{fd\sigma}(\xi)|\leq\ C\ (1+|\xi|)^{-\frac{n-1}{2}}.$$
  It follows that $\widehat{fd\sigma}\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all
$p>\frac{2n}{n-1}$. This result can be extended to compactly supported measure
on $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds with appropriate assumptions on the curvature.
Similar results are known for measures supported in lower dimensional manifolds
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ under appropriate curvature conditions. However, the picture
for fractal measures is far from complete. This thesis is a contribution to the
study of asymptotic properties of the Fourier transform of measures supported
in sets of fractal dimension $0<\alpha<n$ for $p\leq 2n/\alpha$.
  In 2004, Agranovsky and Narayanan proved that if $\mu$ is a measure supported
in a $C^1$-manifold of dimension $d<n$, then $\widehat{fd\mu}\notin
L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $1\leq p\leq \frac{2n}{d}$. We prove that the Fourier
transform of a measure $\mu_E$ supported in a set $E$ of fractal dimension
$\alpha$ does not belong to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $p\leq 2n/\alpha$. We also
study $L^p$-asymptotics of the Fourier transform of fractal measures $\mu_E$
under appropriate conditions on $E$ and give quantitative versions of the above
statement by obtaining lower and upper bounds for the following:
  $$\underset{L\rightarrow\infty}{\limsup} \frac{1}{L^k} \int_{|\xi|\leq
L}|\widehat{fd\mu_E}(\xi)|^pd\xi.$$

observable parameters, anthropic reasoning attempts to constrain probability
distributions over those parameters in order to facilitate the extraction of
testable predictions. The utility of this approach has been vigorously debated
of late, particularly in light of theories that claim we live in a multiverse,
where parameters may take differing values in regions lying outside our
observable horizon. Within this cosmological framework, we investigate the
efficacy of top-down anthropic reasoning based on the weak anthropic principle.
We argue contrary to recent claims that it is not clear one can either dispense
with notions of typicality altogether or presume typicality, in comparing
resulting probability distributions with observations. We show in a concrete,
top-down setting related to dark matter, that assumptions about typicality can
dramatically affect predictions, thereby providing a guide to how errors in
reasoning regarding typicality translate to errors in the assessment of
predictive power. We conjecture that this dependence on typicality is an
integral feature of anthropic reasoning in broader cosmological contexts, and
argue in favour of the explicit inclusion of measures of typicality in schemes
invoking anthropic reasoning, with a view to extracting predictions from
multiverse scenarios.

thermodynamics laws to this hypersurface to find its temperature and thus the
corresponding surface gravity which enables us to get a relation for the

properties of the discovered metric in the Einstein relativity framework which
shows that the primary mentioned null hypersurface is an event horizon. The
obtained energy-momentum tensor equals the energy-momentum tensor of a
polytropic black hole embedded into an anti-de Sitter background. We also show
that if one considers the Misner-Sharp mass in the calculations, the
Schwarzschild metric will be got. The relationship between the two mass
definitions in each metric is studied. The results of considering the
geometrical surface gravity are also addressed. Our investigation shows that
the geometrical surface gravity's definition is not always compatible with the
